{"cik": "1506251", "company": "Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks related to our Business and our Industry\nCitius has a history of net losses and expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability.\nCitius was formed as a limited liability company in 2007 and has only a limited operating history. Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenues from sales of our product candidates. Citius has been focused on product development and has not generated any revenues to date. Citius has incurred losses in each period of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. These losses are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets and shareholders' deficit. The process of developing our products requires significant clinical, development and laboratory testing and clinical trials. In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities. Citius incurred net losses of $2,902,268 for the year ended September 30, 2015, $737,727 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and $1,288,003 for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. At September 30, 2015, Citius had a stockholders' deficit of $635,213 and an accumulated deficit of $9,040,549. Citius' net cash used for operating activities was $2,385,416 for the year ended September 30, 2015, $183,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and $1,095,266 for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively.\nOur ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in:\n\u00b7\ndeveloping and testing product candidates;\n\u00b7\nreceiving regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\ncommercializing our products;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing of commercial quantities of our product candidates at acceptable cost levels; and\n\u00b7\nestablishing a favorable competitive position.\nMany of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will ever have another product approved by the FDA, that we will successfully bring any product to market or, if so, that we will ever become profitable.\nOur auditors have issued a \"going concern\" audit opinion.\nOur independent registered accountants have indicated, in their report on our September 30, 2015 financial statements, that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A \"going concern\" opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Currently, we do not have sufficient capital to continue our operations for the next twelve months. You should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders, in the event of liquidation.\nWe may need to secure additional financing.\nWe anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We have received gross proceeds of approximately $3.6 million to date from our Private Placements, which we expect to continue. If we fail to raise additional funds, our development programs will be materially curtailed. In such event, we expect that we will only be able to conduct a very limited clinical evaluation of our hydrocortisone/lidocaine program. Since this study will involve only a small number of patients, we may not get meaningful and productive data or we may get misleading results.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe rate of progress and cost of our trials and other product development programs for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of obtaining licenses for additional product candidates or acquiring other complementary technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of any regulatory approvals of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; and\n\u00b7\nthe status, terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements.\nWe will need to access the capital markets in the future for additional capital for research and development and for operations. Traditionally, pharmaceutical companies have funded their research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets over the past several years have severely restricted raising new capital and have affected companies' ability to continue to expand or fund existing research and development efforts. If these economic conditions continue or become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in securing additional financing, we may be required to delay significantly, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, product candidates or products.\nWe are an early-stage company with an unproven business strategy and may never achieve commercialization of our therapeutic products or profitability.\nOur strategy of using collaborative partners to assist us in the development of our therapeutic products is unproven. Our success will depend upon our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements on favorable terms and to select an appropriate commercialization strategy for each potential therapeutic product we and our collaborators choose to pursue. If we are not successful in implementing our strategy to commercialize our potential therapeutic products, we may never achieve, maintain or increase profitability. Our ability to successfully commercialize any of our products or product candidates will depend, among other things, on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully complete our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nproduce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of our drug compound(s) to permit successful commercialization;\n\u00b7\nreceive marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nestablish commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nbuild and maintain strong sales, distribution and marketing capabilities sufficient to launch commercial sales of the drug(s) or establish collaborations with third parties for such commercialization;\n\u00b7\nsecure acceptance of the drug(s) from physicians, health care payers, patients and the medical community; and\n\u00b7\nmanage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory approvals and commercialization.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. If we are unable to successfully complete these tasks, we may not be able to commercialize any of our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, in which case we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business. Because of our limited resources, we have decided to focus on the development of our hemorrhoid product prior to developing the next generation of Suprenza products. If we are unable to obtain additional funding and/or manage our spending, we may not be able to initiate any additional development activity on Suprenza. If we experience unanticipated delays or problems, our development costs could substantially increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe face significant risks in our product candidate development efforts.\nOur business depends on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign jurisdiction until we receive the requisite approvals from such jurisdiction. The process of developing new drugs and/or therapeutic products is inherently complex, unpredictable, time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our development programs will result in drugs that will receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance. Product candidates that appear to be promising at all stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons that may not be predictable based on results and data of the clinical program. Product candidates may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side effects during clinical trials, may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated, may not be able to achieve the pre-defined clinical endpoints due to statistical anomalies even though clinical benefit may have been achieved, may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals, may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality, or may fail to achieve market acceptance.\nWe have received FDA approval for our first product, Suprenza. However, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates that are under development and will be further developed using the proceeds of our private placements and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenues from these product candidates, if any. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. For example, the FDA:\n\u00b7\ncould determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncould determine that the information provided by us was inadequate, contained clinical deficiencies or otherwise failed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for any indication;\n\u00b7\nmay not find the data from clinical trials sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or to obtain marketing approval in the United States, including any findings that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\n\u00b7\nmay disagree with our trial design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our trials;\n\u00b7\nmay determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of our Section 505(b)(2) application for any of our product candidates is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs;\n\u00b7\nmay identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for the manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmay approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nmay change its approval policies or adopt new regulations; or\n\u00b7\nmay not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nAny failure to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates would significantly limit our ability to generate revenues, and any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenues.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current product candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials.\nPre-clinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a product candidate in the general population, but rather to test initial safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, to study limited efficacy in a small number of study patients in a selected disease population, and to identify and attempt to understand the product candidate's side effects at various doses and dosing schedules. Success in pre-clinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or trials, including continuing pre-clinical studies and large-scale clinical trials, will be successful nor does it necessarily predict future results. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials, and product candidates in later stage trials may fail to show acceptable safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier trials. In addition, the placebo rate in larger studies may be higher than expected.\nWe may be required to demonstrate through large, long-term outcome trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a broad population prior to obtaining regulatory approval.\nThere is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. In addition, certain subjects in our clinical trials may respond positively to placebo treatment - these subjects are commonly known as \"placebo responders\" - making it more difficult to demonstrate efficacy of the test drug compared to placebo. This effect is likely to be observed in the treatment of obesity and hemorrhoids. If any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we will experience potentially significant delays in, or may decide to abandon development of that product candidate. If we abandon or are delayed in our development efforts related to any of our product candidates, we may not be able to generate any revenues, continue our operations and clinical studies, or become profitable. Our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged. It may not be possible for us to raise funds in the public or private markets, and our stock price would likely decrease significantly.\nIf we are unable to file for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines.\nOur current plans for filing additional NDAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for our additional product candidates and therefore possibly obtain a shortened review period for the applications. The timeline for filing and review of our NDAs is based upon our plan to submit those NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, wherein we will rely in part on data in the public domain or elsewhere. Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA. If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable. As a result of the certification, the third party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us. In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit. Approval of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents to our product candidates. Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of our product candidates. Even if no exclusivity periods apply to our applications under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely. In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of our product candidates. Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming.\nWe may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications, and the FDA may not agree that our products qualify for marketing approval. If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates. In addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA's interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates, post-approval marketing and promotion of products is highly regulated by the FDA, and marketing campaigns which violate FDA standards may result in adverse consequences.\nPost-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label product information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities via the Internet are heavily scrutinized and regulated by the FDA. Drugs may only be marketed for approved indications and in accordance with provisions of the FDA approved labels. Failure to comply with such requirements may result in adverse publicity, warning letters issued by the FDA, and civil or criminal penalties. In 2014 we received a letter from the FDA notifying us that we were in breach of post-marketing regulations with respect to the promotion and advertisement of Suprenza. The FDA demanded that we immediately cease violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, and we, along with our marketing partner Prenzamax, took actions necessary to remedy the violation.\nThe FDA notified us that in light of the actions which were taken to remedy the violation, we are no longer in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and the matter has been closed. The FDA's determination was based upon representations we made and supporting documents which we provided to the FDA assuring the FDA that we have taken corrective action. We believe that we have presented all of the information and that our corrective actions are appropriate and adequate. In the event the FDA discovers repeat or new violations, we could face stiffer penalties in the future including the FDA's issuance of a cease and desist order, impounding of our products, and civil or criminal penalties.\nWe cannot be certain that we, or our marketing partner Prenzamax, will, in the future, be able to comply with post-marketing regulations or other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, Prenzamax or our future partners are not able to comply with such requirements, the FDA may issue a warning letter which may require us to stop our clinical trials and/or the sale of our drug, require us to recall our drug from distribution or result in withdrawing approval of the NDA for such drug. Any of the foregoing actions by the FDA may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from any resulting drugs will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.\nEven if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, those drugs may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. The indication may be limited to a subset of the population or we may implement a distribution system and patient access program that is limited. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally is also necessary for optimal commercial success. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such drugs will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ntiming of market introduction of competitive drugs;\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7\nresults of any post-approval studies of the drug;\n\u00b7\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments including generics;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration and dosing schedule;\n\u00b7\nstrength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nprice of any future drugs, if approved, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators' sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of current and future healthcare laws on our product candidates;\n\u00b7\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers;\n\u00b7\npatient access programs that require patients to provide certain information prior to receiving new and refill prescriptions;\n\u00b7\nrequirements for prescribing physicians to complete certain educational programs for prescribing drugs;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of government or third-party coverage; and\n\u00b7\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nIf approved, our product candidates may fail to achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nEven if approved for marketing by applicable regulatory bodies, we will not be able to create a market for any of our products if we fail to establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties.\nOur strategy with our product candidates is to outsource to third parties, all or most aspects of the product development process, as well as marketing, sales and distribution activities. Currently, we do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. In order to generate sales of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts. To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others. These efforts may not be successful. If we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, or enter into arrangements with third parties, we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs.\nOur agreement with Prenzamax may result in a conflict of interest.\nIn November 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Prenzamax LLC, pursuant to which we granted Prenzamax a license for sales of Suprenza in the U.S. Prenzamax's performance of this agreement is guaranteed by Akrimax LLC. The co-founder and vice Chairman of Akrimax is Leonard Mazur who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. In connection with the license agreement, Prenzamax will be solely responsible for the pricing of Suprenza and will have the option to participate in the future development program of Suprenza. There may be a conflict of interest in what may be beneficial to the Company and to Prenzamax. There can be no assurance that Prenzamax will choose the option that best suits the Company.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants or established companies.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries is intense and is characterized by costly and extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We are aware of several pharmaceutical companies also actively engaged in the development of therapies for the same conditions we are targeting. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development capabilities as well as substantially greater marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have significantly greater experience than us in undertaking pre-clinical testing, human clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we are currently marketing or researching and developing. Such developments could render our products, if approved, less competitive or possibly obsolete. We are also competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have limited experience. Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and similar events may also significantly increase the competition. New developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our products and product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u00b7\nresearch and development resources, including personnel and technology;\n\u00b7\nregulatory experience;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidate development and clinical trial experience;\n\u00b7\nexperience and expertise in exploitation of intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7\naccess to strategic partners and capital resources.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we can or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs or surgical approaches that are more effective, more useful and less costly than ours and may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors may be more effective than us in commercializing their products and as a result, our business and prospects might be materially harmed.\nPhysicians and patients might not accept and use any of our products for which regulatory approval is obtained.\nEven if the FDA approves one of our product candidates, other than Suprenza which is already approved, physicians and patients might not accept and use it. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the\n\u00b7\nsafety and effectiveness of our product;\n\u00b7\ncost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing product or therapies;\n\u00b7\navailability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u00b7\neffective marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf our current product candidates are approved, we expect their sales to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and as a result, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing.\nOur product candidate for the treatment of hemorrhoids is a combination product consisting of two drugs, hydrocortisone and lidocaine, that have each been separately approved by the FDA for other indications and which are commercially available and marketed by other companies. Our approval under 505(b)(2) does not preclude physicians, pharmacists and patients from obtaining individual drug products and titrating the dosage of these drug products as close to our approved dose as possible.\nHydrocortisone creams are available from strengths ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% and lidocaine creams are also available in strengths up to 5%. From our market analysis and discussions with a limited number of physicians, we know that patients sometimes obtain two separate cream products and co-administer them as prescribed, giving them a combination treatment which could be very similar to what we intend to study and seek approval for. As a branded, FDA-approved product with safety and efficacy data, we intend to price our product substantially higher than the generically available individual creams. We will then have to convince third-party payers and pharmacy benefit managers of the advantages of our product and justify our premium pricing. We may encounter resistance from these entities and will then be dependent on patients' willingness to pay the premium and not seek alternatives. In addition, pharmacists often suggest lower cost prescription treatment alternatives to both physicians and patients. Our 505(b)(2) approval and the market exclusivity we may receive will not guarantee that such alternatives will not exist, that substitution will not occur, or that there will be immediate acceptance to our pricing by payer formularies. We expect the same resistance with regard to our phentermine product where several cheaper generics are already commercially available and physicians have extensive experience in prescribing these products.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our products sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur ability to commercialize our products, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from:\n\u00b7\ngovernment and health administration authorities;\n\u00b7\nprivate health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and\n\u00b7\nother healthcare payers.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. Even if our product candidates are approved by the FDA, insurance coverage might not be available, and reimbursement levels might be inadequate, to cover our products. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, once approved, market acceptance of such products could be reduced. Proposals to modify the current health care system in the U.S. to improve access to health care and control its costs are continually being considered by the federal and state governments. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress passed landmark healthcare legislation. We cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically. Members of the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures are seeking to overturn at least portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess this legislation and possibly alternative health care reform proposals. We cannot predict whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nHealth administration authorities in countries other than the U.S. may not provide reimbursement for our products at rates sufficient for us to achieve profitability, or at all. Like the U.S., these countries have considered health care reform proposals and could materially alter their government-sponsored health care programs by reducing reimbursement rates. Any reduction in reimbursement rates under Medicare or foreign health care programs could negatively affect the pricing of our products. If we are not able to charge a sufficient amount for our products, then our margins and our profitability will be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon Alpex Pharma, S.A. (\"Alpex\") to supply us withthe active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for phentermine hydrochloride which makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely upon Alpex for API.\nIn general, our suppliers purchase raw materials and supplies on the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us. We have entered into a supply agreement with Alpex pursuant to which Alpex supplies us with the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for phentermine hydrochloride. Alpex currently has one source of supply for API, Siegfried (USA), Inc., a U.S. based manufacturer (\"Siegfried\"). If Alpex can no longer obtain API from Siegfried or if Siegfried refuses to continue to supply to Alpex on commercially reasonable terms or at all, Alpex will have to qualify another supplier. Qualification of alternate sources is costly and a time consuming process. If Alpex cannot find a replacement supplier, our margins and our profitability may be adversely affected. Although management believes there are several other potential sources of API, there can be no assurance that Alpex can obtain API from such suppliers upon favorable terms, or at all.\nWe rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates.\nWe do not have and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. Consequently, we lack the physical plant to formulate and manufacture our own product candidates, which are currently being manufactured entirely by a commercial third party. If any additional product candidate we might develop or acquire in the future receives FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our products. If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current source or any future source to manufacture our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for preclinical, clinical and commercial purposes. We might not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any that we do identify. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance might be materially affected.\nIn addition, before any of our collaborators can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates, each must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. Our contracted manufacturing facilities must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre- approval inspection might significantly delay FDA approval of our products. If any of our collaborators fails to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action which could limit the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nOur reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u00b7\nWe might be unable to identify manufacturers for commercial supply on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would generally require compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any;\n\u00b7\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u00b7\nOur contract manufacturers might not perform as agreed or might not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products;\n\u00b7\nCurrently, our contract manufacturer is foreign, which increases the risk of shipping delays and adds the risk of import restrictions;\n\u00b7\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have complete control over third-party manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u00b7\nIf any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we might not own, or might have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation with our licensors;\n\u00b7\nOperations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including a bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier, and\n\u00b7\nWe might compete with other companies for access to these manufacturers' facilities and might be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials or the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nWe will be dependent on third-party contract research organizations to conduct all of our future human studies.\nWe will be dependent on third-party research organizations to conduct all of our human studies with respect to pharmaceutical products that we may develop in the future. If we are unable to obtain any necessary testing services on acceptable terms, we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner. If we rely on third parties for human studies, we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties. These third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we so request. We may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our human studies. We are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our general plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our future product candidates.\nAny termination or breach by or conflict with our strategic partners or licensees could harm our business.\nIf we or any of our collaborators or licensees fail to renew or terminate any of our collaboration or license agreements or if either party fails to satisfy its obligations under any of our collaboration or license agreements or complete them in a timely manner, we could lose significant sources of revenue, which could result in volatility in our future revenue. In addition, our agreements with our collaborators and licensees may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could lead to termination of the agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply or commercialization of certain products, or could require or result in litigation or arbitration. Any such conflicts with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and could have a negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators, adversely affecting our business and revenues. Finally, any of our collaborations or license agreements may prove to be unsuccessful.\nIf we are unable to retain or hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business might be harmed.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have one (1) employee and one (1) part-time consultant for business development purposes. We also have two (2) part-time consultants in accounting and finance. In addition, we utilize the services of a clinical management ream on part time basis to assist us in managing our current on-going phase 2 trial. While we believe this will provide us with sufficient staffing for our current development efforts, we will need to hire or contract with additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing in connection with the continued development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nIn addition, we may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications by principal executive officers. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC, as well as the adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers. Further, some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual's independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. The Company may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of the shares of Company Common Stock on any stock exchange or quotation platform other than OTC Markets or the OTCQB where the Company's shares are currently quoted (assuming we elect to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing) could be adversely affected.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe will need to manage our anticipated growth and increased operational activity. Our personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy will require that we:\n\u00b7\nmanage our regulatory approval trials effectively;\n\u00b7\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators and other third parties;\n\u00b7\ndevelop internal sales and marketing capabilities or establish collaborations with third parties with such capabilities;\n\u00b7\ncommercialize our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nimprove our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u00b7\nattract and motivate sufficient numbers of talented employees.\nThis future growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require our management to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory and Legal Environment\nWe are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.\nProduct candidates and approved products such as ours are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities, whether administered orally, topically or by injection, as drugs, subject to an NDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If product candidates and approved products such as ours are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval. Such foreign regulation might be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation. Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our products. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Our collaborators or we must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials and approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements. Securing regulatory approval requires submitting extensive preclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product's safety and efficacy for each intended use. The development and approval process might take many years, requires substantial resources, and might never lead to the approval of a product. Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval might limit the indicated medical uses for the product, limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, might require further regulatory review and approval. Once obtained, any approvals might be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.\nIf we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things, delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; warning letters; fines; import and export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.\nIn connection with our NDA, we committed to conducting two post-marketing studies of Suprenza ODT. The FDA required us to conduct a drug utilization study because phentermine is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, as a Category IV controlled substance, and the FDA expressed concern regarding the potential for phentermine abuse and addiction. We prepared and submitted protocols for this study to the FDA however, upon further internal analysis, the FDA concluded that such a study is not necessary and informed us that we need not conduct this study.\nIn addition, the FDA required that we study the pharmacokinetic, or PK, parameters of Suprenza ODT in subjects with renal impairment. Drug exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment who are treated with phentermine. However, Suprenza ODT's pharmacokinetics has not been assessed in renal impaired patients. Since obesity can lead to renal failure, there exists a possibility that patients with mild or moderate renal failure may be prescribed Suprenza ODT. Therefore, it is important to assess the changes in the PK parameters of Suprenza ODT in patients with renal impairment. The primary endpoint of this study is the pharmacokinetic assessment of Suprenza ODT in renal impaired patients, and the results of this study will provide important new information to prescribing physicians regarding phentermine dosing and dose adjustments for these at-risk patients.\nA clinical research organization has indicated that it will cost approximately $400,000 and take 18 months to conduct the renal impairment study. Due to the limited current sales of Suprenza, we requested the FDA waive the renal PK study requirement. however, our request was denied. In the FDA's letter dated August 28, 2015, the FDA notified us that our request to waive the study was denied because financial hardship was an inadequate reason to justify a waiver of the study. In addition, the FDA restated the FDA's concern that there is a signal of serious risk of increased drug exposure in patients with decreased renal function. If we fail to conduct the post-marketing renal PK study, the FDA may ask us to discontinue selling the product or impose other penalties which they deem suitable.\nIn general, the FDA allows companies to continue selling their product while post-marketing studies are being conducted. Based upon limited sales and usage of our product, we intend to reapply for a waiver of the post-marketing study. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will release us from such requirement. If our next request to waive the post-marketing studying is denied and we do not have sufficient funding to conduct the study, we will likely discontinue the sale of Suprenza. If we receive sufficient funding and determine to proceed with the renal impairment study, and the results of such study demonstrate safety concerns, we may have to add additional disclosures to our label or alternatively, discontinue the sale of the product. Adding additional disclosures to our label will delay the timeline for when our product reaches the market. A delay in our product reaching the market or the discontinuance of the sale of Suprenza will result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe might not obtain the necessary U.S. regulatory approvals to commercialize any additional product candidates.\nWe have received FDA approval for the sale of our first product, Suprenza. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize for sale any additional product candidates, or any additional product candidate we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our additional product candidates in the U.S. In order to obtain FDA approval of any additional product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research, pre-clinical studies, and clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA's regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in additional drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for their indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process and might require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing, perform post-marketing studies or otherwise limit or impose conditions on any additional approvals we obtain. The approval process might also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals might:\n\u00b7\ndelay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our additional product candidates;\n\u00b7\nimpose costly procedures on us; and\n\u00b7\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise enjoy.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA might ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for any additional product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of our additional product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without additional saleable products, and therefore without any potential additional sources of revenues, until another product candidate could be developed or obtained. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any additional product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our additional potential drugs.\nIf one of our additional product candidates is approved by the FDA or by another regulatory authority for a territory outside of the U.S., we will be required to comply with extensive regulations for product manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the product candidates or to whom and how we may distribute our products. Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a drug's indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. For example, the label ultimately approved for our products, if any, may include restrictions on use, including restrictions based on level of obesity and duration of treatment. If so, we may be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products. The FDA could also require a registry to track the patients utilizing the drug or implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, that could restrict access to the drug, reduce our revenues and/or increase our costs. Potentially costly post-marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority.\nManufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our future approved drugs, if any, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a drug, its manufacturer and the manufacturer's facilities to continual review and inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of that drug, up to and including, withdrawal of the drug from the market. If the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in regulatory action and additional costs to us. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, if any, subject our company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\nissuance of Form 483 notices, warning letters and adverse publicity by the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nimposition of fines and other civil penalties due to product liability or other issues;\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecutions;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions, suspensions or revocations of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of manufacturing;\n\u00b7\ndelays in commercialization;\n\u00b7\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our collaborators;\n\u00b7\nrefusals to permit drugs to be imported into or exported from the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls or seizures.\nWe have an agreement with Alpex Pharma S.A. (\"Alpex\") to supply our Suprenza tablets. The Alpex manufacturing sites have been inspected by the U.S. FDA and corresponding EU authorities. If Alpex is unable to maintain ongoing FDA or local or foreign regulatory compliance, or manufacture Suprenza tablets in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, the approval, the commercial launch, and future sales of Suprenza will be adversely effected, which in turn could have a detrimental impact on our financial results.\nIn addition, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceuticals may change. New statutory requirements may be enacted or additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Contract Manufacturing Organizations, or CMOs, and their vendors or suppliers may also face changes in regulatory requirements from governmental agencies in the U.S. and other countries. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, extent or effects of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or elsewhere. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market any future approved products and our business could suffer.\nWe could be forced to pay substantial damage awards if product liability claims that may be brought against us are successful.\nThe use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to liability claims and financial losses resulting from the use or sale of our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials of $2 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible of $50,000 per occurrence. There can be no assurance that our existing insurance coverage will extend to our other products in the future. Any product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities resulting from product liability claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace, and would likely divert management's attention.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur Suprenza tablets could face generic competition before the patent protecting them expires on July 23, 2018.\nOn May 17, 2013, we received notification from Zydus that Zydus had submitted Abbreviated New Drug Application No. 204663 to the FDA seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use or sale of generic versions of the 15 mg and 30 mg dosages of our Suprenza\u00d2 tablets. The notification informed us that Zydus was seeking to manufacture and sell its generic product prior to the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 6,149,938 (the \"938 patent\") which is listed in the Orange Book and covers Suprenza\u00d2, and that the Zydus ANDA contained a certification that its proposed generic product does not infringe the '938 patent (\"Paragraph IV Certification\"). On June 19, 2013, we received a separate notification from Zydus that it was also pursuing approval for the 37.5 mg dosage of Suprenza\u00d2 under the same-numbered ANDA, with a separate Paragraph IV Certification. In response, within 45 days of receiving the first notification from Zydus, we and our partners (Alpex Pharma, S.A. and Prenzamax, LLC), filed suit against Zydus and its parent Cadila Healthcare Limited (d/b/a Zydus Cadila) in Federal District Court in Delaware and New Jersey for infringement of the '938 patent pursuant, pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman statutory regime. We promptly notified the FDA of the initiation of this lawsuit and, pursuant to the statute, Zydus's ANDA for a generic version of Suprenza\u00d2 cannot be approved by the FDA for 30 months from our receipt of Zydus' Paragraph IV notice letters while this lawsuit proceeds.\nSeveral months after initiation of the suit, we initiated discussions with Zydus to seek a resolution to this dispute. We diligently negotiated a settlement agreement and dismissal of the pending lawsuit to the mutual satisfaction of all parties. As a result of this mutual agreement, the district court officially terminated the suit on November 21, 2014. The terms of the settlement agreement remain confidential per mutual agreement of the parties. The resolution of this matter has been deemed a success by Akrimax and its partners Citius, Prenzamax, and Alpex.\nOn November 24, 2015, a petition for inter partes review (the \"Petition\") was filed by Mr. J. Kyle Bass and Mr. Erich Spengenberg with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \"PTAB\") of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"), challenging claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,440,170 (the \"170 Patent\"), titled \"Orally Disintegrating Tablets with Speckled Appearance,\" which patent is owned by Alpex Pharma and is licensed by the Company. The inter partes review procedure allows a party to challenge the patentability of a patent before the PTAB. A patentability trial will commence if the PTAB decides to institute the inter partes review proceedings after considering the Petition and Alpex's preliminary response to the Petition. Pursuant to our agreement with Alpex, it is Alpex' primary responsibility to defend the patents. Alpex is reviewing its options and will inform us of its decision accordingly. If Alpex elects to not defend this patent, then we have the right to do so. The 170 patent relates to the appearance of the Suprenza tablets and we believe that loss of this patent will not have any material impact on Suprenza sales. Since we have already settled with Zydus on the main patent and we fully expect to have competition to our Suprenza, we are unlikely to defend this patent.\nAside from risks in outcome, there are a number of aspects of any intellectual property litigation that may have an impact on the Company, including:\n\u00b7\nhigh litigation costs;\n\u00b7\ndistractions and other business interruptions due to litigation-related responsibilities such as discovery, depositions, court appearances, trial, etc.;\n\u00b7\nmedia coverage and other marketing-oriented influences relating to the progress of the litigation; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral uncertainty pending district court outcome and exhaustion of all appeals.\nOur business depends on protecting our intellectual property.\nIf we and our strategic manufacturing partner, Alpex, do not obtain protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors might be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing drugs. Our success, competitive position and future revenues, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To date, we exclusively license one patent from Alpex. We also have the exclusive right to one pending patent from Alpex. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries, as appropriate. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7\nOur patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise might not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u00b7\nOur competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which might make significant investments in competing technologies, might seek, or might already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the U.S. or in international markets;\n\u00b7\nAs a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there might be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for\ndisease treatments that prove successful; and\n\u00b7\nCountries other than the U.S. might have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign\ncompetitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and inventions agreements with our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will not be breached, that we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are breached, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If any of these events occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nPatent and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate. Our business and prospects will be harmed if these protections prove insufficient.\nWe rely on trade secret protections through confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers and other parties, and the breach of these agreements could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe rely on trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, collaborators, supplies, and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors. We might be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management's attention from our operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we might have to forgo selling our future products, pay damages, or defend against litigation.\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we might have to:\n\u00b7\nobtain licenses, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nabandon an infringing product candidate;\n\u00b7\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u00b7\npay damages, and/or\n\u00b7\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nAny of these events could substantially harm our earnings, financial condition and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock, Liquidity Risks and Reverse Acquisition\nOur securities will be deemed to be \"Penny Stock\" and subject to specific rules governing their sale.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a \"penny stock,\" for the purposes relevant to Company, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \"penny stock\" rules. This may make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of the Company's Common Stock if and when such shares are eligible for sale and may cause a decline in the market value of its stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nCompliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.\nWhile the Company was not previously subject to the filing requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, it filed certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on a voluntary basis. On October 22, 2015, the Company registered its Common Stock under the Exchange Act and the filing of the reports with the SEC became mandatory. The quotation of the Company's common stock on the OTCQB is contingent upon the Company staying current on such Exchange Act filings. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we remained privately-held. In addition, the Company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the preparation of its Registration Statement and related documents with respect to the registration of resale of the Common Stock sold in our Private Placements.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or detect fraud. Consequently, shareholders could lose confidence in the Company's financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of its stock.\nThe Company must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and to be able to detect fraud. The Company has been assessing its internal controls to identify areas that need improvement. It is in the process of implementing changes to internal controls, but has not yet completed implementing these changes. Failure to implement these changes to the Company's internal controls or any others that it identifies as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm its operating results and cause shareholders to lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the trading price of the Company's stock.\nThe price of the Common Stock may become volatile, which could lead to losses by shareholders and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of the Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in the Company's operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments by the Company or its competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe completion and/or results of the Company's clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions regarding the Company's products\n\u00b7\nannouncements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting the Company's industry;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products by the Company or its competitors;\n\u00b7\nsales of the Company's Common Stock or other securities in the open market; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated against the Company, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of its management's attention and resources, which could harm the Company's business and financial condition.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of the Common Stock.\nIn the future, the Company may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of its present stockholders. The Company is currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 90,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 1, 2015, there are 34,701,220 shares of Common Stock outstanding, 7,020,438 shares underlying the Investor Warrants issued in the Private Placements, 680,013 shares issuable upon the exercise of the Placement Agent Unit Warrants, 680,013 shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants underlying the Placement Agent Unit Warrants, 1,000,000 shares underlying the Placement Agent Share Warrants issued in connection with investment banking services, 3,300,000 shares underlying the options granted to our President and CEO, Leonard Mazur, 800,000 shares underlying options granted to directors, and 600,000 shares underlying options granted to consultants. The Company may also issue additional shares of its Common Stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of its securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of Common Stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Common Stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of the Common Stock are currently quoted on the OTCQB, which is one of OTC Markets' three marketplaces for trading over-the-counter stocks.\nThe Common Stock is controlled by insiders.\nAs of December 1, 2015, the former managing members of Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC beneficially own approximately 46% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and the Company's current officer and directors beneficially own approximately 7% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. Such concentrated control of the Company may adversely affect the price of the Common Stock. If you acquire Common Stock, you may have no effective voice in the management of the Company. Sales by insiders or affiliates of the Company, along with any other market transactions, could affect the market price of the Common Stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no dividends on our Common Stock to date and it is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan. The lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our stock, and could significantly affect the value of any investment in our Company.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows for the board of directors to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Common Stock.\nThe Company's Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. The Company's Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, the Company's Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of Common Stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the Common Stock. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than the Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIf and when our Registration Statement No. 333-206903 becomes effective, there will be a significant number of shares of Common Stock eligible for sale, which could depress the market price of such shares.\nFollowing the effective date of our Registration Statement No. 333-206903, a large number of shares of Common Stock will be available for sale in the public market, which could harm the market price of the stock. Further, shares may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, and these sales may have a depressive effect as well.\nWe have broad discretion on how we use the proceeds we received in our Private Placements.\nOur management has broad discretion on how to use and spend any proceeds we receive from our Private Placements and may use the proceeds in ways that differ from the proposed uses discussed in this filing. Our stockholders may not agree with our decision on how to use such proceeds. If we fail to spend the proceeds effectively, our business and financial condition could be harmed and we may need to seek additional financing sooner than expected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is not an active liquid trading market for the Company's common stock.\nThe Company files reports under the Exchange Act and its common stock is eligible for quotation on the OTCQB. However, there is no regular active trading market in the Company's common stock, and we cannot give any assurance that an active trading market will develop. In October 2015, the Company's Common Stock traded on only four days for an aggregate volume of 5,900 shares. If an active market for the Company's common stock develops, there is a significant risk that the Company's stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements that our revenue or income are below analysts' expectations;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic slowdowns;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of the Company's common stock; and\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital\ncommitments.\nBecause we became a public company by means of a reverse acquisition, we may not be able to attract the attention of brokerage firms.\nBecause we became public through a \"reverse acquisition\", securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of the Company in the future.\nApplicable regulatory requirements, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for the Company to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of its common stock.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications by principal executive officers. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC, as well as the adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers.\nFurther, some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual's independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. The Company may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of common stock on any stock exchange (assuming the Company elects to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing) could be adversely affected.\nAs an issuer of \"penny stock\", the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward looking statements does not apply to us.\nAlthough federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading. Such an action could hurt our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16857, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CTXR"}
