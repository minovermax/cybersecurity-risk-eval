RISK FACTORS\nOur operations face certain risks that should be considered in evaluating our business. We manage and mitigate these risks on a proactive basis, using an enterprise risk management program. Nevertheless, the following risk factors, some of which may be beyond our control, could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation, and may cause future results to be materially different than our current expectations. These risk factors are not intended to be all inclusive.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by the unpredictability, duration, and severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our business, operations, and financial performance. Given the unpredictability, duration, and, at times, the severity of resurgences of the pandemic, its ultimate effect on our business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain. There are many factors, not within our control, which could affect the pandemic's ultimate impact on our businesses and our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame. These include, but are not limited to: the response of governments, businesses and individuals to the pandemic; its impact on the labor force, the global economy and economic activity (including inflation), and the spending habits of consumers and businesses; disruptions in global supply chains; and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In addition to having the effect of potentially heightening many of our other risk factors in this section, the COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, adversely affect the following to the detriment of our business, including:\n\u2022Our ability to sell products and provide services to our clients, fulfill orders, and install equipment on a timely basis and market to prospective new clients due to social distancing rules and heightened security policies.\n\u2022The acceleration of the decline of physical mail volumes in the geographies in which we operate, which adversely affects both our Presort Services and SendTech Solutions segments. We cannot yet assess the extent to which these declines in mail volumes, and resulting impact to our business, are permanent or temporary.\n\u2022The financial health of posts around the world, especially that of the USPS, given the adverse effects associated with the declines in physical mail volumes. If these financial difficulties are not resolved, or if any resolution requires posts to operate differently, price in a manner that hurts their competitiveness or further reduces postal volume or causes them to change their contractual relationships with their partners or vendors, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Costs and reduced labor productivity associated with extended safety protocols, higher levels of employees out sick, hiring and training temporary labor, redirecting volumes to other facilities, and complying with government mandates.\n\u2022Global Ecommerce\u2019s costs, including those relating to postage, transportation, and warehouse space, resulting from sudden and significant increases or decreases in volumes, due to unexpected short-term shifts in consumer spending patterns or short-term interruptions or delays in our retail client\u2019s supply chains.\n\u2022Our ability to timely obtain parts, supplies, or finished goods from our vendors in order to meet our sales obligations or equip our facilities.\n\u2022The frequency of long-distance airplane flights, resulting in higher costs and at times, reduced demand for our Global Ecommerce cross-border offerings.\n\u2022Delinquencies in collections and bankruptcies in our clients, which could affect our cash flow. Client requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications could also reduce the profitability or ongoing cash flow from some of our current customers.\n\u2022Third-party service providers ability to satisfy their performance obligations to us, which in turn affects our ability to satisfy our service commitments to our clients.\n\u2022Our earnings or cash flows, which could result in additional credit rating downgrades, higher costs of borrowing, or limit our access to additional debt.\nMailing and Shipping Industry Risks\nFurther significant deterioration in the financial condition of the USPS, or the national posts in our other major markets, could affect the ability of those posts to provide services to us or our clients, which could adversely affect client demand for our offerings and thus our financial performance.\nWe are dependent on financially viable national posts in the geographic markets where we operate, particularly in the United States. A significant portion of our revenue depends upon the ability of these posts, especially the USPS, to provide competitive mail and package delivery services to our clients and the quality of the services they provide. Their ability to provide high quality service at affordable rates in turn depends upon their ongoing financial strength. If the posts are unable to continue to provide these services into the future, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete in the package shipping market in the United States depends upon certain contractual relationships we have with the USPS and the successful performance of those services.\nThe USPS is our primary provider for the \u201clast mile\u201d component of our parcel delivery services in the United States. This represents a significant component of our cost in offering these services. If we are unable to receive competitive pricing from the USPS or take advantage of lower cost USPS options, our ability to compete with private carriers and to achieve profitable revenue growth will be adversely affected. The quality of service we provide to our clients also depends upon the quality of delivery services received from the USPS. As the ecommerce market continues to evolve, and as the USPS implements changes to its network, if the USPS\u2019 service performance is materially worse than that of the private carriers, we may lose clients to competition and our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to postal regulations and processes, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA significant portion of our business is subject to regulation and oversight by the USPS and posts in other major markets. These postal authorities have the power to regulate some of our current products and services. They also must approve many of our new or future product and service offerings before we can bring them to market. If our new or future product and service offerings are not approved, there are significant conditions to approval, regulations on our existing products or services are changed or, we fall out of compliance with those regulations, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to respond to the continuing decline in the volume of physical mail delivered via traditional postal services, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nTraditional mail volumes continue to decline and impact our current and future financial results, primarily within our SendTech Solutions and Presort Services segments. An accelerated or sudden decline could result from changes in communication behavior or available communication technologies, reductions to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) under which the USPS and other national posts are required to deliver to every address in a country with similar pricing and frequency, pandemics, and legislation or regulations that mandate electronic substitution for communication by mail, prohibit certain types of mailings, increase the difficulty of using information or materials in the mail, or impose higher taxes or fees on postal services. If we are not successful at meeting the continuing challenges faced in our mailing business, or if physical mail volumes were to experience an accelerated or sudden decline, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nSignificant changes to the laws regulating the USPS or other posts, or changes in their operating models could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nAs a significant portion of our revenue and earnings is dependent on postal operations, changes in the laws and regulations that affect how posts operate could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. As posts consider new strategies for their operations in an era of declining mail volumes and increasing package volumes, if we are unable to work with posts to support those strategies, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nBusiness Operational Risks\nWe face intense competition in the industries in which we operate.\nThe markets for our products and services in each of our segments are highly competitive. In our Global Ecommerce segment, we face competition in our shipping business from full-service ecommerce business process outsourcers, online marketplaces, freight forwarders, and major global delivery services companies, including those that can offer both domestic and cross-border solutions in a single package. Our digital delivery business competes with technology providers ranging from large, established companies to\nsmaller companies offering negotiated carrier rates. If we cannot compete against these competitors with, among other things, speed of delivery, price, reliability, functionality and scalability of our platform and logistic services and ease of integration and use, we may lose clients, incur additional costs and suffer from reduced margins, and the financial results of the segment may be adversely affected. Our Presort Services segment faces competition from regional and local presort providers, cooperatives of multiple local presort providers, consolidators and service bureaus that offer presort solutions as part of a larger bundle of outsourcing services and large volume mailers that have sufficient volumes and the capability to presort their own mailings in-house and could use excess capacity to offer presort services to others. If we are not able to effectively compete on price, innovative service, delivery speed, tracking and reporting, we may lose clients and the financial results of the segment may be adversely affected. Our Sending Technology Solutions segment faces competition from other mail equipment and solutions providers, companies that offer products and services as alternative means of message communications and those that offer online shipping and mailing products and services solutions. In addition, our financing operations face competition, in varying degrees, from large, diversified financial institutions, including leasing companies, commercial finance companies and commercial banks, as well as small, specialized firms. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors or effectively compete with them, the financial results of the segment may be adversely affected.\nThe evolution of our businesses to more digital and shipping-related services has resulted in a decline in our overall profit margins. If we cannot increase our volumes while at the same time reduce our costs, our overall profitability could be adversely affected.\nAs our businesses shift to more digital and shipping-related services, the relative revenue contribution from our shipping-related offerings now exceeds that of the revenue from our mailing-related offerings. We expect the revenue contribution from shipping services to continue to grow; however, profit margins on these services are lower than those for our mailing-related offerings. Accordingly, if we cannot gain additional economies of scale through increasing volumes, lowering our cost per piece and in turn, improve margins and profitability, our short and long-term financial performance will be adversely affected.\nSeasonality of the Global Ecommerce segment, unexpected declines in consumer demand or the performance of our retail customers, or unexpected spikes in the costs of labor or transportation, especially during the fourth quarter, could adversely affect our overall performance.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment derives the majority of its revenue from its retail clients. The retail industry is subject to cyclical trends in consumer sentiment and spending habits that are affected by many factors, including prevailing economic conditions, recession or fears of recession, inflation, unemployment levels, pandemics (as continues to be the case with the COVID-19 pandemic) or geopolitical events. Our retail clients are also dependent on third party suppliers to provide them with either raw materials or finished goods to meet the product demands of their clients. Moreover, Global Ecommerce\u2019s annual financial results are also highly dependent on its performance during the peak holiday season in the fourth quarter. If consumer sentiment or spending habits deteriorate or change such that the demand for our clients\u2019 online products is negatively impacted, or if our clients encounter supply chain challenges, we could incur unexpected costs and revenue declines, and if these factors impact our fourth quarter, as occurred in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on the segment's financial results could be more severe.\nThe loss of any of our largest clients in our Global Ecommerce segment could adversely affect the financial performance of that segment.\nThe Global Ecommerce segment receives a large portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of clients and business partners. The loss of any of these larger clients or business partners, or a substantial reduction in their use of our products or services, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of the segment. There can be no assurance that our larger clients and business partners will continue to utilize our products or services at current levels, or that we would be able to replace any of these clients or business partners with others who can generate revenue at current levels.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our third-party suppliers, or if their ability to perform were negatively impacted, our business, financial performance and reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur SendTech Solutions segment relies on third-party suppliers for services and components for our mailing equipment, spare parts, supplies and services and for the hosting of our SaaS offerings. We also rely on third party suppliers to help us equip our Presort and Ecommerce facilities and to provide us with services related to some of our operations. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers around the world because of advantages in quality, price or lack of alternative sources. If our suppliers are not able to provide these services, components or equipment to us in a timely manner, or if the supply chain constraints we are currently experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic were to worsen, the quality of the goods or services received were to deteriorate, our relationship with certain suppliers were to be terminated, or if the costs of using these third parties were to increase\nand we were not able to find alternate suppliers, we could lose clients, incur significant disruptions in manufacturing and operations and increased costs, including higher freight and re-engineering costs.\nFluctuations in transportation costs or disruptions to transportation services in our Global Ecommerce or Presort Services segments could adversely affect client satisfaction or our financial performance.\nIn addition to our reliance on the USPS, our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services segments rely upon independent third-party transportation service providers to transport a significant portion of our parcel and mail volumes. Some of our providers may also be our competitors. The use of these providers is subject to risks, including our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, increased competition during peak periods, capacity issues, performance problems, extreme weather, natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, increased fuel costs, labor shortages or disputes and other unforeseen difficulties. Any disruption to the timely supply of these services for any reason, any dramatic increase in the cost of these services or any deterioration of the performance of these services (each of which we experienced, at times, during the COVID-19 pandemic), could adversely affect client satisfaction or our financial performance. Given our continued reliance upon these providers, any future unforeseen disruptions affecting these providers could similarly adversely affect client satisfaction and our financial performance.\nOur business depends on the our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with, employees at a reasonable cost to meet the needs of our business and to consistently deliver highly differentiated, competitive offerings.\nThe rapid growth of the ecommerce industry has resulted in intense competition for employees in the shipping, transportation and logistics industry, including drivers and warehouse employees. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this industry growth resulting in our Global Ecommerce segment experiencing a higher demand, and increased competition, for labor, especially in our warehouses. This increased demand and competition for workers has also impacted our Presort Services segment. We supplement our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services workforce with contingent hourly workers from staffing agencies on an as-needed basis. Due to increased demand and competition, concern over exposure to COVID-19 and other factors, at times during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced labor shortages, increased costs and reduced productivity. If we experience similar labor shortages again, do not effectively manage our use of such contingent workers, or if our staffing agencies chose to terminate their relationship with us and we cannot find alternative providers, it could result in increased costs and adversely affect our operations. Moreover, given the nature of our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services employee base, if we cannot continue to maintain good relationships with those employees resulting in employee dissatisfaction and turnover, our operating costs could significantly increase, and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced.\nThere is also significant competition for the talent needed to develop our other products and services. Increased competition for employees has resulted in higher wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain employees with the right skill sets. Additional labor costs which may also impact our business include those triggered by regulatory actions; increased health care and workers\u2019 compensation insurance expenses; and, those costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which in our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services segments, continues to include costs resulting from reduced productively (staggering shifts, breaks to enhance social distancing and higher levels of employees out sick), costs for extended safety protocols in our warehouses and incremental costs required to hire temporary labor.\nOur inability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement by others may negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents and licenses; however, our business success depends in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights, including proprietary technology developed or obtained through acquisitions. We rely on copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The continued evolution of patent law and the nature of our innovation work may affect the number of patents we are able to receive for our development efforts. As we continue to transition our business to more software and service-based offerings, patent protection of these innovations will be more difficult to obtain. In addition, from time to time, third parties may claim that we, our clients, or our suppliers, have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, if successful, may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products.\nIf we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, our financial performance, brand name and reputation could suffer.\nWe have a significant number of contracts with governmental entities. Government contracts are subject to extensive and complex procurement laws and regulations, along with regular audits and investigations by government agencies. If one or more government agencies discovers contractual noncompliance by us or one of our subcontractors in the course of an audit or investigation, we may be subject to various civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which could include the termination of the contract, reimbursement of payments received, fines and debarment from doing business with one or more governments. Any of these events could not only affect our financial performance, but also adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestitures which may harm our financial performance.\nWe may make strategic acquisitions or divest certain businesses. These actions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance, including:\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated benefits or synergies;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings and entering new markets, or reducing fixed costs previously associated with divested businesses;\n\u2022the loss of key employees or clients of businesses acquired or divested;\n\u2022significant charges for employee severance and other restructuring costs, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees; and\n\u2022possible goodwill and asset impairment charges as divestitures and changes in our business model may adversely affect the recoverability of certain long- lived assets and valuation of our operating segments.\nOur capital investments to develop new products and offerings or expand our current operations may not yield the anticipated benefits.\nWe are making significant capital investments in new products, services, and facilities. If we are not successful in these new product or service introductions at the levels anticipated when making the investments, there may be an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nOur financial performance and our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could be subject to legal liability or regulatory enforcement actions, if we or our suppliers are unable to protect against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents.\nWe depend on the security of our and our suppliers' information technology systems to support numerous business processes and activities, to service our clients, and to enable consumer transactions and postal services. There are numerous cybersecurity risks to these systems, including individual and group criminal hackers, industrial espionage, denial of service attacks, ransomware and malware attacks, attacks on the software supply chain, and employee errors and/or malfeasance. These cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of preventing, detecting, and successfully defending against them. Successful breaches could, among other things, disrupt our operations or result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse of company, client, consumer and employee sensitive and confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance. Cybersecurity breaches could result in financial liability to other parties, governmental investigations, regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, and our brand and reputation could be damaged. Although we maintain insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity incidents, we may incur costs or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through our insurance.\nWe have security systems, procedures, and business continuity plans in place-and require our suppliers to have them as well. These security systems, procedures, and business continuity plans are designed to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, protect against unauthorized access to information or disruption to our services, and minimize the impact of and the time to detect, respond, and recover from a breach should one occur. Despite the protections we have in place, we have suffered cyber-events in the past. In response to these attacks, we implemented a variety of measures to further enhance our cybersecurity protections and minimize the impact of any future attack. None of these systems are fool proof and like all companies, intrusions will occur, and have occurred, from time to time. Our goal is to prevent meaningful incursions and minimize the overall impact of those that occur.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and protection laws and regulations could subject us to legal liability and adversely affect our reputation and our financial performance.\nOur businesses use, process, and store proprietary information and personal, sensitive, or confidential data relating to our business, clients, and employees. Privacy laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business require that we take significant steps to safeguard that information, and these laws and regulations continue to evolve. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting. In addition, new laws may add a broad array of requirements on how we handle or use information and increase our compliance obligations. For example, the European Union greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Law by enacting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which, among other things, enhanced an individual\u2019s rights with respect to their information and ongoing litigation in the European Union continues to create uncertainty in how to demonstrate compliance. In the United States, several states have enacted different laws regarding personal information and privacy that impose significant new requirements on consumer personal information. Other countries or states may enact laws or regulations in the future that have similar or additional requirements. Although we continually monitor and assess the impact of these laws and regulations, their interpretation and enforcement are uncertain, subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement. Failure to comply with data privacy and protection laws and regulations could also result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties) and private litigation, which could adversely affect our reputation and financial performance.\nIf we or our suppliers encounter unforeseen interruptions or difficulties in the operation of our cloud-based applications, our business could be disrupted, our reputation and relationships may be harmed, and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur business relies upon the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our and our suppliers' cloud-based applications and systems to support numerous business processes, to service our clients and to support their transactions with their customers and postal services. Our applications and systems, and those of our partners, may be subject to interruptions due to technological errors, system capacity constraints, software errors or defects, human errors, computer or communications failures, power loss, adverse acts of nature and other unexpected events. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place to protect our business operations in case of such events and we also require our suppliers to have the same. Nonetheless, there can be no guarantee that these plans will function as designed. If we are unable to limit interruptions or successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all, it could result in lost revenue, loss of critical data, significant expenditures of capital, a delay or loss in market acceptance of our services and damage to our reputation, brand and relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial performance.\nMacroeconomic and General Regulatory Risks\nFuture credit rating downgrades or capital market disruptions could adversely affect our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide competitive financing services to our clients and to fund various discretionary priorities.\nWe provide competitive finance offerings to our clients and fund discretionary priorities, such as business investments, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases through a combination of cash generated from operations, deposits held at the Bank and access to capital markets. Our ability to access U.S. capital markets and the associated cost of borrowing is dependent upon our credit ratings and is subject to capital market volatility. Given our current credit rating, we may experience reduced financial or strategic flexibility and higher costs when we do access the U.S. capital markets. We maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility that requires we maintain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants.\nA significant decline in cash flows, noncompliance with any of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, further credit rating downgrades, material capital market disruptions, significant withdrawals by depositors at the Bank, adverse changes to our industrial loan charter or an increase in our credit default swap spread could impact our ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide competitive finance offerings to our clients, refinance maturing debt and fund other financing activities, which in turn, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment is exposed to increased foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe sales generated from many of our clients\u2019 internationally focused websites running on our cross-border platform are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Currently, our platforms are located in the U.S. and the U.K. and a majority of consumers making purchases through these platforms are in a limited number of foreign countries. A strengthening of the U.S. Dollar or British Pound relative to currencies in the countries where we do the most business impacts our ability to compete internationally as the cost of similar international products improves relative to the cost of U.S. and U.K. retailers' products. A strong U.S. Dollar or British Pound would likely result in a decrease in international sales volumes, which would adversely affect the segment's revenue and profitability.\nOur operations and financial performance may be negatively affected by changes in trade policies, tariffs and regulations.\nOur Global Ecommerce segment is subject to significant trade regulations, taxes, and duties throughout the world. Any changes to these regulations could potentially impose increased documentation and delivery requirements, delay delivery times and subject us to increased costs and additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Within the last four years, the United States increased tariffs for certain goods, which triggered other nations to also increase tariffs on certain of their goods. For our Global Ecommerce segment, tariff increases, or even an environment of uncertainty surrounding trade issues, could reduce demand and adversely affect its financial performance. For our SendTech Solutions segment, increased tariffs resulted in additional costs on certain components used in some of our products.\nIf we do not keep pace with evolving expectations and regulators in the areas of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and address the potential impact of climate change on our costs and operations, our reputation and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe set of topics incorporated within the term ESG in general, and climate change in particular, cover a range of issues that pose potential risks to our operations. From an environmental perspective, the impact of climate change and a potential increase in extreme weather events may pose risk to the operation of our sortation facilities and the ability to transport mail and packages. The increased focus on alternative energy sources and the need to reduce our carbon footprint over time, could result in higher investments in capital spending and increased operational costs. There are also a series of laws related to product stewardship and waste disposal to which we need to comply. From a \u201csocial\u201d perspective, a failure to meet employee expectations around safety and diversity, equity and inclusion could impact our ability to recruit new employees and retain talent. Finally, from a \u201cgovernance\u201d perspective, if we do not maintain a good governance processes in general or do not satisfy investor stakeholder expectations on ESG, our reputation and attractiveness to portions of the investment community could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 24459, "SIC": 3579, "TIC": "PBI"}
