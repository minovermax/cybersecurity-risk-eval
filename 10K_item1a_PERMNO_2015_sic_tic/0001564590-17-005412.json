Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nOur indebtedness contains various covenants that impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business and increase our interest expense.\nIn March 2017, we repaid and terminated our revolving credit facilities through the sale of a Senior Secured Term Note (the \u201cNote\u201d) in the amount of $7.00 million as described in Note 8 and Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The note sale provided us with approximately $1.00 million of additional funds for working capital. The Note\u2019s governing documents contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for such financing, including various financial covenants which we must meet on a monthly basis. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.\nOur indebtedness could have negative consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions could increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general could be limited;\n\u2022\nour amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nour customers may react adversely to our significant debt level and seek or develop alternative licensors or suppliers; and\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, may limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nCustomers in the oil and gas industry account for a significant portion of our sales. Reduced expenditures by customers in this industry are likely to reduce demand for our products and services.\nCustomers related to the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas industry accounted for approximately 47% and 81% of our net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The oil and gas industry is a cyclical commodity business, with product demand and prices based on numerous factors such as general economic conditions and local, regional and global events and conditions that affect supply, demand and profits. Demand for our products and services benefits from strong oil and gas markets. The recent decline in the price for oil and its prolonged lower prices has caused a decrease in demand for our products and services resulting in a decline in our net sales, profit margins and cash flows.\nOur products include complex systems for energy and industrial markets which are subject to operational and liability risks.\nWe are engaged in the manufacture and installation of complex power distribution and control systems for the energy and industrial markets. These systems are frequently complex and susceptible to unique engineering elements that are not tested in the actual operating environment until commissioned. As a result, we may incur unanticipated additional operating and warranty expenses that were not anticipated when the fixed-price contracts were estimated and executed resulting in reduced profit margins on such projects.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, which may result in a loss of market share or decrease in net sales or profit margin.\nOur products and services are provided in a highly competitive environment and we are subject to competition from a number of similarly sized or larger businesses which may have greater financial and other resources than are available to us. Factors that affect competition include timely delivery of products and services, reputation, manufacturing capabilities, price, performance and dependability. Any failure to adapt to a changing competitive environment may result in a loss of market share and a decrease in net sales and profit margins.\nWe often utilize fixed-price contracts which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our net sales under fixed-price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for such fixed-price contracts. The cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed-price contracts, may result in actual costs and gross profits for a project differing from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability and losses on projects. Depending upon the size of fixed-price contracts, variations from estimated contract costs can have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year.\nOur use of percentage-of-completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profit.\nA portion of our net sales is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting practice we use results in recognizing contract net sales and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract net sales, costs and profitability. Contract losses are recognized in full when determined, and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability. Actual collection of contract amounts or change orders could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings in future periods. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant.\nInability to obtain performance bonding could prevent us from bidding on certain projects\nA portion of the Company\u2019s growth is focused on power generation projects and the EPC firms building them. Those bids typically require a form of surety which could be a letter of credit or a performance bond. Failure to obtain adequate bonding capacity could hinder our growth in this market.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the net sales value reported in our backlog.\nOrders included in our backlog are represented by customer purchase orders and contracts. Backlog develops as a result of new business which represents the net sales value of new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog consists of projects which have either (1) not yet been started or (2) are in progress and are not yet complete. In the latter case, the net sales value reported in backlog is the remaining value associated with work that has not yet been completed. From time to time, projects that were recorded as new business are cancelled. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total net sales included in our backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, we may also incur additional costs resulting from underutilized assets if projects are cancelled.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could disrupt our operations or be adverse to our business.\nOur continued success is dependent on the continuity of several key management, operating and technical personnel. The loss of these key employees would have a negative impact on our future growth and profitability. We have entered into written employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer; Chief Financial Officer; Chief Operating Officer; and International Director, who is responsible for managing our BOMAY joint venture operations relationships and Brazil subsidiary.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted by economic uncertainty and global recession.\nThe consequences of a prolonged recession could include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding commodity and capital markets. The lack of a sustained economic recovery could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of net sales or profitability.\nOur ability to provide high-quality products and services on a timely basis requires that we employ an adequate number of skilled personnel. Accordingly, our ability to increase our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.\nNatural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions could harm our business and operations.\nNatural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations or those of our customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe manufacture products and operate plants in Texas and Brazil. Operations in the United States have been disrupted in the past due to hurricanes. Although we have not suffered any material losses as a result of these disruptions due to our insurance coverage and advance preparations, it is not possible to predict future similar events or their consequences, any of which could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or disrupt our supply chain.\nWe generate a significant portion of our net sales from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nApproximately 13% of our net sales in 2016 were generated from projects and business operations outside of the United States, primarily provided to the oil and gas drilling and marine industries in the following countries: Mexico, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Indonesia and Brazil. This percentage was approximately 15% in 2015. The oil and gas industry operates in both remote and potentially politically unstable locations, and numerous risks and uncertainties affect our non-United States operations. These risks and uncertainties include changes in political, economic and social environments, local labor conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, as well as United States laws affecting activities of United States companies abroad, including tax laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. In addition, the costs of providing our services can be adversely and/or unexpectedly impacted by the remoteness of the locations and other logistical factors.\nThe marketplace may not accept and utilize our newly developed products and services, the effect of which would prevent us from successfully commercializing our proposed products or services and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to market and commercialize our new products and services depends on the acceptance of such products and services by the industry.\nJoint Venture limited life risk\nThe joint venture, BOMAY was formed in 2006 in China. It was formed with a term of 12 years. The joint venture may be terminated earlier for valid business reasons including Force Majeure. In the event the joint venture is to be terminated, either party may acquire the other parties\u2019 interests and continue the operations of the joint venture. Additionally, the term of the joint venture may be extended upon agreement of all parties. In such case, the joint venture shall apply for the extension to the relevant Chinese authority six months before expiry of the venture. At this time, AETI has no indication that the joint venture will not be extended beyond 12 years.\nRisk related to our Chinese Joint Venture\nWe maintain a significant investment in a joint venture with a Chinese energy company. We may encounter risks pertaining to a weakening Chinese economic environment. We may encounter unforeseen or unexpected operating, financial, political or cultural factors that could impact its business plans and the expected profitability from such investment. We will face risks if China loses normal trade relations with the United States and it may be adversely affected by the diplomatic and political relationships between the United States and China. As a result of the relatively weak Chinese legal system, in general, and the intellectual property regime, in particular, we may face additional risk with respect to the protection of our intellectual property in China. Changes in China\u2019s political and economic policies could adversely affect our investment and business opportunities in China.\nRisk from Restricted U.S. Government Access to Audit Documents in China\nThe audit of BOMAY for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was conducted in China by a Chinese audit firm not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) under the direction of the Company\u2019s independent auditor. The Company\u2019s independent auditor has directed additional procedures to comply with auditing standards prescribed by the PCAOB.\nUnder the laws of the United States, auditors of public companies are to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB and to make all requested work papers available for the SEC and the PCAOB inspection. However, due to laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China applicable to auditors, the SEC and the PCAOB are currently unable to conduct such inspections on work papers prepared in China without the approval of the Chinese government authorities.\nAs a result, the SEC or PCAOB may be unable to conduct inspections of the BOMAY audit work papers. The Company\u2019s stockholders may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections, and may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of portions of our financial statements.\nJoint Venture Centralized Government Risks\nSince the centralized government of China controls most of the petroleum industry and related manufacturing through annual planning and budgets, the financial results realized by the Company\u2019s joint venture, BOMAY, will reflect the government\u2019s decisions on production levels for oil and gas equipment. The Company further understands that the value of BOMAY\u2019s assets, including inventory, may not be fully realized if demand for these products is reduced significantly because of economic policy decisions or other organizational changes in the Chinese petroleum industry.\nMarket Risk\nThe markets in which we participate are capital intensive and cyclical in nature. The volatility in customer demand is greatly driven by the change in the price of oil and gas. These factors influence the release of new capital projects by our customers, which are traditionally awarded in competitive bid situations. Coordination of project start dates is matched to the customer requirements and projects may take a number of months to complete; schedules also may change during the course of any particular project.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk\nThe Company operates a subsidiary in Brazil and maintains equity method investments in its Chinese and Singapore joint ventures, BOMAY and MIEFE. The functional currencies of the Brazilian subsidiary and the joint ventures are the Brazilian Real, Chinese Yuan and Singapore Dollar, respectively. Investments are translated into United States Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each quarterly reporting period. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. The translation adjustment decreased from $0.31 million at December 31, 2015 to $0.00 million at December 31, 2016 due principally to the weakening of the Brazilian Real and strengthening of the Chinese Yuan versus the United States Dollar.\nOther than the aforementioned items, we do not believe we are exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risk because most of our net sales and purchases are denominated in United States Dollars.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We endeavor to recoup these price increases from our customers on an individual contract basis to avoid operating margin erosion. Although historically we have not entered into any contracts to hedge commodity risk, we may do so in the future. Commodity price changes can have a material impact on our prospective earnings and cash flows. Copper, steel and aluminum represent a significant element of our material cost. Significant increases in the prices of these materials could reduce our estimated operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest rate sensitive items do not subject us to material risk exposures. Our revolving credit facility remains available through December 29, 2017. The revolving promissory note has a similar interest rate exposure, with semi-annual payments of $0.15 million. The outstanding balance is due December 2020. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $5.70 million of variable-rate term debt outstanding. At this borrowing level, a hypothetical relative increase of 10% in interest rates would have an unfavorable but insignificant impact on the Company\u2019s pre-tax earnings and cash flows. The primary interest rate exposure on variable-rate debt is based on the three month LIBOR rate (0.98% at December 31, 2016) plus 4.00% per year. The loan agreements are collateralized by real estate, trade accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and work-in-process, and guaranteed by our operating subsidiaries. In March 2017, the Company refinanced our outstanding debt at a fixed rate.
