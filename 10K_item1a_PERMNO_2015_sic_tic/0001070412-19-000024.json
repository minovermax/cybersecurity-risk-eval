The following sets forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss.\nPrices for natural gas and NGLs are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including oversupply relative to the demand for our products, weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels. An extended decline in the prices we receive for our natural gas and NGLs will adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our natural gas and NGLs. Natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate prices are very volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon supply from energy producers relative to demand for these products and other factors beyond our control. The disposition in 2017 of our entire coal operations has increased our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate.\nIn particular, the U.S. natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply due to the success of Marcellus and other new shale plays. The oversupply of natural gas in 2012 resulted in domestic prices hovering around ten-year lows, and drilling continued in these plays, despite these lower gas prices, to meet drilling commitments. Although gas prices have arguably recovered as of 2018, continued volatility remains a strong possibility.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian Basin, which exacerbates the impact of regional supply and demand factors on our business, including the pricing of our gas. The success of the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale plays has resulted in growth in natural gas production in this region, with production per day in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio more than tripling since 2011. Not all of the natural gas produced in this region can be consumed by regional demand and must therefore be exported to other regions through pipelines. This export causes gas purchased and sold locally to be priced at a discount to many other market hubs, such as the benchmark Louisiana Henry Hub price. This discount, or negative basis, to the Henry Hub price is forecasted to continue in future years. While we expect many of the planned interstate pipeline projects to reduce this discount, it could widen further if these projects to move gas out of the basin are delayed or denied for any reason, such as permitting issues or environmental lawsuits.\nAn extended period of lower natural gas prices can negatively affect us in several other ways, including reduced cash flow, which decreases funds available for capital expenditures to replace reserves or increase production. Also, our access to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable.\nOur drilling plans also include some activity in areas of shale formations that may also contain NGLs, condensate and/or oil. The prices for NGLs, condensate and oil are also volatile for reasons similar to those described above regarding natural gas. As a result of increasing supply, condensate and oil prices have exhibited great volatility. In addition, similar to the oversupply of natural gas, increased drilling activity by third-parties in formations containing NGLs has led to a decline of over 40% since 2014 in the uplift we receive, on an Mcf equivalent basis when excluding hedging impact, from NGLs. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by a continued depressed level of, or further downward fluctuations in, NGLs, condensate and oil prices.\nApart from issues with respect to the supply of products we produce, demand can fluctuate widely due to a number of matters beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nweather conditions in our markets that affect the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022\nchanges in the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users of electricity and natural gas;\n\u2022\nwith respect to natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuel sources used by electricity generators;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and conservation measures reducing demand;\n\u2022\nthe costs, availability and capacity of transportation infrastructure;\n\u2022\nproximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in levels of international demand and tariffs associated with international export; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and climate change regulations and delays.\nOur business depends on gathering, processing and transportation facilities and other midstream facilities owned by CNXM and others. The disruption of, capacity constraints in, or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas and NGLs and cash flows from operations, and any decrease in availability of pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to third parties\u2019 or CNXM\u2019s gathering systems could adversely affect our operations or our investment in CNXM.\nWe gather, process and transport our natural gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others, including CNXM. If pipeline or facility capacity is limited, or if pipeline or facility capacity is unexpectedly disrupted for any reason, our natural gas sales and/or sales of NGLs could be reduced, which could negatively affect our profitability. If we cannot access processing pipeline transportation facilities, we may have to reduce our production of natural gas. If our sales of natural gas or NGLs are reduced because of transportation or processing constraints, our revenues will be reduced and our unit costs will increase. If pipeline quality standards change or we cannot meet applicable standards, we might be required to install additional processing equipment which could increase our costs. Further, in some circumstances we need to meet predetermined specifications with respect to our blending of dry and damp gas; changes in the production mix could negatively impact our ability to efficiently meet our specified requirements. Pipelines could also curtail our flows until the natural gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance. Any reduction in our production of natural gas or increase in our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, a significant portion of our natural gas is sold on or through a single pipeline, Texas Eastern Transmission, which could experience capacity issues, operational disruptions and unexpected downtime. Any reduction in capacity on the Texas Eastern pipeline could result in curtailments and reduce our production of natural gas. A reduction in capacity could also reduce the demand for our natural gas, which would reduce the price we receive for our production.\nIn addition to our relationship with CNXM, we have various third-party firm transportation, natural gas processing, gathering and other agreements in place, many of which have minimum volume delivery commitments. We are obligated to pay fees on minimum volumes to our service providers regardless of actual volume throughput. Reductions in our drilling program may result in insufficient production to utilize our full firm transportation and processing capacity. If we have insufficient production to meet the minimum volumes, our cash flow from operations will be reduced, which may require us to reduce or delay our planned investments and capital expenditures or seek alternative means of financing, all of which may have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investment in midstream infrastructure through CNXM is intended, among other items, to connect our wells to other existing gathering and transmission pipelines. Our infrastructure development and maintenance programs, through CNXM, can involve significant risks, including those relating to timing, cost overruns and operational efficiency, which risks can be further affected by other issues. For example, approximately 34% of our 2018 production flowed through CNXM\u2019s Majorsville and McQuay Stations. An operational issue at either of those stations would materially impact CNX\u2019s production, cash flow and results of operation. CNXM\u2019s assets connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The continuing operation of third-party pipelines, processing and fractionation plants, compressor stations and other midstream facilities is not within our or CNXM\u2019s control. These third-party pipelines, processing and fractionation plants, compressor stations and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, changes to operating conditions, delivery or receipt parameters, unavailability of firm transportation, lack of operating capacity, force majeure events, regulatory requirements and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues.\nWe face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nNatural gas reserves are economically recoverable when the price at which they are expected to be sold exceeds their expected cost of production and sales. Natural gas reserves require subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas, and assumptions concerning natural gas prices, production levels, reserve estimates and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved natural gas reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be incorrect. For example, a significant amount of our proved undeveloped reserves extensions and discoveries during the last three years were due to the addition of wells on our Marcellus Shale acreage more than one offset location away from existing production with reliable technology, which may be more susceptible to positive and negative changes in reserve estimates than our proved developed reserves. Over time, material changes to reserve estimates may be made, taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. Also, we make certain assumptions regarding natural gas prices, production levels, and operating and development costs that may prove to be incorrect. Any significant variance from these\nassumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of our natural gas reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of natural gas reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of natural gas we ultimately recover being different from reserve estimates. The PV-10 measure of pre-tax discounted future net cash flows and the standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved natural gas reserves on historical average prices and costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ngeological conditions;\n\u2022\nour acreage position, and our ability to acquire additional acreage, including third-party swaps to develop our position efficiently;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nfuture prices and our hedging position;\n\u2022\nfuture operating costs;\n\u2022\noperational risks and results; and\n\u2022\ncapital costs of drilling, completion and gathering assets.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. If natural gas prices decline by $0.10 per Mcf, then the pre-tax present value using a 10% discount rate of our proved natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018 would decrease from $6.2 billion to $6.0 billion.\nEach of the factors impacting reserve estimation may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves. For these reasons, estimates of natural gas reserves may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our natural gas reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. As a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual natural gas reserves.\nDeveloping and producing natural gas wells is a high-risk activity.\nOur growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. Drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that an encountered well does not produce in sufficient quantities to make the well economically viable. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including those discussed in \u201cOur operations are subject to operating risks that could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are also subject to hazards, and any losses or liabilities, we suffer from such hazards may not be fully covered by our insurance policies\u201d set forth below.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful, and if they are unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. We may be unable to drill identified or budgeted wells within our expected time frame, or at all. We may be unable to drill a particular well because, in some cases, we identify a drilling location before we have leased all of the interests required to drill the well in that location. Similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of delineation efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and any other participants in a well for the drilling of the well;\n\u2022\nwhether we are able to acquire on a timely basis all of the leasehold interests required for the well, including through swap transactions with other operators;\n\u2022\nwhether we are able to obtain, on a timely basis or at all, the permits required to drill the wells;\n\u2022\nwhether production levels align with estimates;\n\u2022\neconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;\n\u2022\nthe formation as to which we drill, as the cost structure between wet gas which requires additional processing and dry gas varies; and\n\u2022\nour financial resources and results.\nOur business strategy focuses on horizontal drilling and production in the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays in the Appalachian Basin. Drilling horizontal wells is technologically difficult and involves risks relating to our ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages and to successfully run casing the length of the well bore and involves a higher risk of failure when compared to vertical wells. Additionally, drilling a horizontal well involves higher costs, which results in the risks of our drilling program being spread over a smaller number of wells, and that, in order to be profitable, each horizontal well will need to produce at a higher level in order to cover the higher drilling costs. Similarly, the average lateral length of the horizontal wells we drill has generally been increasing. Longer-lateral wells are typically more expensive and require more time for preparation and permitting. In addition, we use multi-well pads instead of single-well sites. The use of multi-well pad drilling increases some operational risks because problems affecting the pad, or a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. Pad drilling can also make our overall production, and therefore our revenue and cash flows, more volatile, because production from multiple wells on a pad will typically commence simultaneously. While we believe that we are better served by drilling horizontal wells using multi-well pads, the risk component involved in such drilling will be increased in some respects, with the result that we might find it more difficult to achieve economic success in our drilling program.\nOur operations are subject to operating risks that could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are also subject to hazards, and any losses or liabilities we suffer from such hazards may not be fully covered by our insurance policies.\nOur exploration for and production of natural gas and CNXM\u2019s gathering, compression and transportation operations involve numerous operational risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating our shale gas wells, shallow oil and gas wells and coalbed methane (CBM) wells is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay, suspend, or prevent drilling operations, decrease production and/or increase the cost of our natural gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results. The risks that may have a significant impact on our natural gas operations include those relating to, among other things, unexpected drilling conditions (pressure or irregularities in geologic formations or wells, material and equipment failures, fires, ruptures, landslides, mine subsidence, explosions or other accidents and environmental concerns and adverse weather conditions); similar operational or design issues relating to pipelines, compressor stations, pump stations, related equipment and surrounding properties, including with respect to materials and equipment developed, designed or installed or properties owned or operated by third-parties; challenges relating to transportation, pipeline infrastructure and capacity for treatment or disposal of waste water generated in drilling, completion and production operations and failure to obtain, or delays in the issuance of, permits at the state or local level and the resolution of regulatory concerns.\nThe realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations, materially increase our costs, or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, including our properties and our natural gas production or transportation facilities;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others;\n\u2022\npotential legal liability and monetary losses;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation within the industry or with customers;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nThe occurrence of any of these events in our gas operations that prevents delivery of natural gas to a customer and is not excusable as a force majeure event under our supply agreement, could result in economic penalties, suspension or ultimately termination of the supply agreement.\nAlthough we and CNXM maintain insurance for a number of risks and hazards, we may not be insured or fully insured against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident or disruption in our operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over multiple years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the acquisition on acceptable terms of any leasehold interests we do not control but that are necessary to complete the drilling unit, including potentially through third-party swap transactions, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory and zoning approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled. We will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these locations may not be successful or result in our ability to add additional proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for investing our capital resources to produce superior rates of return. In developing our business plan, we consider allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items (including share and debt repurchases) and other alternatives. We also consider our likely sources of capital, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and future growth may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nOur development and exploration projects, as well as CNXM\u2019s midstream system development, require substantial capital expenditures and if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our natural gas reserves may decline, and financial results may suffer.\nAs part of our strategic determinations, we expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in the development and acquisition of natural gas reserves. Further, CNXM will need to make substantial capital expenditures to fund its share of growth capital expenditures associated with its Anchor Systems, as well as to fund its share of expenditures associated with its 5% controlling interests in the Additional Systems or to purchase or construct new midstream systems. If CNXM is unable to make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, it will be unable to maintain and grow its business.\nCNXM's amended gathering agreement with us, CNXM's largest customer, includes minimum well commitments; however, that gas gathering agreement and the gas gathering agreements CNXM has with other third-parties impose obligations on CNXM to invest capital which is not fully protected against volumetric risks associated with lower-than-forecast volumes flowing through its gathering systems. To the extent CNXM\u2019s customers are not contractually obligated to, and determine not to, develop their properties in the areas covered by CNXM\u2019s acreage dedications, the resulting decreases in the development of reserves by CNXM customers could result in reduced volumes serviced by CNXM and a commensurate decline in revenues and cash flows.\nThere is no assurance that we or CNXM will have sufficient cash from operations, borrowing capacity under each company\u2019s respective credit facilities or the ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets to meet our capital requirements. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under either company\u2019s credit facilities are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, or we are unable to obtain additional financing, we could be required to curtail the pace of the development of our natural gas properties and midstream activities, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal or state level may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our natural gas assets and such regulation, as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation, could adversely impact the market for natural gas, as well as for our securities.\nThe issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with underlying concern about the impacts of human activity, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) such as carbon dioxide (\u201cCO2\u201d) and methane, on the environment.\nThe EPA, under the Climate Action Plan, elected to regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) to limit emissions of CO2 from natural gas-fired power plants. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Carbon Pollution Standards to cut carbon emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants, which became effective on October 23, 2015. In August 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan Rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which became effective on December 22, 2015. While consolidated petitions challenging the Clean Power Plan Rule are ongoing at the circuit court level, a mid-litigation application to the Supreme Court has resulted in a current stay of the Clean Power Plan Rule. In April 2017, the EPA announced that it was initiating a review of the Clean Power Plan consistent with President Trump\u2019s Executive Order 13783, and in October 2017 published a proposed rule to formally repeal the Clean Power Plan. On August 20, 2018, the EPA issued the proposed \u201cAffordable Clean Energy Rule.\u201d The comment period on the proposal closed on October 31, 2018, and the EPA is considering the comments submitted. On November 21, 2018, the EPA filed a status report in which the EPA indicated that it expected to take final rulemaking action on a replacement rule for the Clean Power Plan by the first part of 2019.\nThe EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permits for large stationary sources. Facilities requiring PSD permits may also be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d (BACT) standards. Rulemaking related to GHG could alter or delay our ability to obtain new and/or modified source permits.\nThe EPA has also adopted rules to control volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations as part of its initiative to reduce methane emissions. In response to subsequent judicial involvement, the EPA issued a proposed rule in July 2017 that would stay the methane rule for two years, but this rule is not yet final and is subject to public notice, comment, and legal challenges.\nAdditionally, the application of the CAA to CNX and CNXM facilities, as well as the application of state sponsored permitting programs provide regulatory uncertainty and therefore present risks, including risks regarding hitting production objectives, and cost for controls and compliance. Some states in which we operate, including Pennsylvania are contemplating measures, or have issued mandates, to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and potential cap-and-trade programs. Most of these types of programs require major source of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available being reduced each year until a target goal is achieved. The cost of these allowances could increase over time. While new laws and regulations that are aimed at reducing GHG emissions will increase demand for natural gas, they may also result in increased costs for permitting, equipping, monitoring and reporting GHGs associated with natural gas production and use.\nEnvironmental regulations can increase costs and introduce uncertainty that could adversely impact the market for natural gas with potential short and long-term liabilities.\nWe and CNXM are subject to various stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly response actions. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our, CNXM\u2019s and our respective customers' operations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in joint and several or strict liability or the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and/or the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which CNXM\u2019s gathering systems pass, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance. There is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nOur operations, and those of CNXM, also pose risks of environmental liability due to leakage, migration, releases or spills from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Certain environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for costs required to investigate, remediate, and restore sites where hazardous substances,\nhydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may also be subject to fines and penalties for such releases. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.\nThe Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and similar state laws protect species endangered or threatened with extinction. Protection of endangered and threatened species may cause us to modify gas well pad siting or pipeline right of ways, or to develop and implement species-specific protection and enhancement plans and schedules to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats. A number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the ESA, including the Northern Long-Earned and Indiana bats. Further consideration for listing species within our operating region is expected, and CNX considers this uncertainty, as well as the cost to comply with stringent mitigation requirements, a risk to cost and operational timing.\nCNX utilizes pipelines extensively for its natural gas and water businesses. Stream encroachment and crossing permits from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) are often required for certain impacts these pipelines cause to streams and wetlands. In June 2017, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule that would initiate the first step in a two-step process intended to review and revise the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the Clean Water Act. The EPA moved forward with the first step on December 11, 2018, when it issued a proposed, revised rule which would replace a prior 2015 rule with pre-2015 regulations, and which narrowed language defining \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the Clean Water Act that existed prior to that time. This proposal is subject to public comment and the rulemaking process. The second step would be a notice-and-comment rulemaking in which federal agencies will conduct a substantive reevaluation of such definition. While we cannot at this time predict the final form that the rule will ultimately take, such rulemaking could lead to additional mitigation costs and severely limit CNX\u2019s operations.\nOther regulations applicable to the natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion at both the federal and state levels. Any future changes may increase the costs of producing natural gas and other hydrocarbons, which would adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations. For example, hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight unconventional shale formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas agencies. The disposal of produced water and other wastes in underground injection disposal wells is regulated by the EPA under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or by various states in which we conduct operations under counterpart state laws and regulations. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations or to dispose of waste resulting from such operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain required personnel, services, equipment, parts and raw materials in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at reasonable costs to support our operations.\nWe rely on third-party contractors to provide key services and equipment for our operations. We contract with third-parties for well services, related equipment, and qualified experienced field personnel to drill wells, construct pipelines and conduct field operations. We also utilize third-party contractors to provide land acquisition and related services to support our land operational needs. The demand for these services, this equipment and for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells, construct pipelines and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. Weather may also play a role with respect to the relative availability of certain materials. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe, compressors and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. The costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater in periods of peak demand, including increased demand for plays outside of our area of geographic focus. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain necessary services, drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, and we may experience shortages of, or increases in the costs of, drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and field services in the future.\nAny of the above shortages may lead to escalating prices for drilling equipment, land services, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. Shortages may lead to poor service and inefficient drilling operations and increase the possibility of accidents due to the hiring of inexperienced personnel and overuse of equipment by contractors. Additionally, a decrease in the availability of these services, equipment and personnel could lead to a decrease in our natural gas production, increase our costs of natural gas production, and decrease our anticipated profitability. Such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which events could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe attempt to mitigate the risks involved with increased natural gas production activity by entering into \u201ctake or pay\u201d contracts with well service providers which commit them to provide field services to us at specified levels and commit us to pay for field services at specified levels even if we do not use those services. However, these types of contracts expose us to economic risk during a downturn in demand or during periods of oversupply. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, due to the oversupply of gas in our markets, we made payments under these types of contracts of approximately $7 million and $40 million, respectively, for field services that we did not use. Having to pay for services we do not use decreases our cash flow and increases our costs.\nIf natural gas prices decrease or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record write-downs of our proved natural gas properties. Additionally, changes in assumptions impacting management\u2019s estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions related to the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples, could cause goodwill and other intangible assets we hold to become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to earnings.\nLower natural gas prices or wells that produce less than expected quantities of natural gas may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or our exploration results deteriorate, accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our natural gas properties. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management's plans change with respect to those assets. For example, in the second quarter of 2015, we had an impairment charge of approximately $829 million for certain of our natural gas assets, primarily shallow oil and gas assets. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.\nAs a result of our acquisition of the 50% interest in CNX Gathering in the first quarter of 2018, we acquired approximately $925 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. Future acquisitions may also lead to the acquisition of additional goodwill or other intangible assets. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. The future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings and results of operations for the affected periods. In May 2018, CNX determined that the carrying value of a portion of the customer relationship intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the Midstream Acquisition exceeded their fair value in conjunction with the Asset Exchange Agreement with HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC (See Note 6 - Acquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion). CNX recognized an impairment on this intangible asset of $19 million, which is included in Impairment of Other Intangible Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCompetition and consolidation within the natural gas industry may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and midstream services. Increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect our sales of, or our prices for, our products, which could impair our profitability.\nThe natural gas, exploration, production and midstream industries are intensely competitive with companies from various regions of the United States and, increasingly, competition in the international markets. The industry has been experiencing increased competitive pressures as a result of both consolidation within the exploration and production space, along with the emergence of stand-alone midstream companies. Many of the companies with which we and CNXM compete are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources. If we are unable to compete, our company, our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected. In addition, larger companies may be able to pay more to acquire new natural gas properties for future exploration, limiting our ability to replace the natural gas we produce or to grow our production. There is also increased competition within the industry as a result of oil-focused drilling, where natural gas is produced as an ancillary byproduct and may be sold at prices below market. The highly competitive environment in which we operate may negatively impact our ability to acquire additional properties at prices or upon terms we view as favorable. The competitive environment can also make it more challenging to discover new natural gas resources, evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate these transactions on acceptable terms. Any reduction in our ability to compete in current or future natural gas markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, CNXM\u2019s ability to increase throughput on its midstream systems and any related revenue from third-parties is subject to capacity availability on its existing systems, its ability to expand its existing systems, contractual obligations to its existing customers and competition from third parties, primarily operators of other natural gas gathering systems. The fact that a substantial majority of the capacity of CNXM\u2019s midstream systems will be necessary to service the production of CNX and one third-party customer and we and that third-party will receive priority of service for the provision of CNXM midstream services over other third-parties, may result in CNXM not having the capacity to provide services to other third-party customers. In addition, potential third-party customers who are significant producers of natural gas and condensate may develop their own midstream systems in lieu of using CNXM\u2019s systems. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on CNXM\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions and therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our investment in CNXM.\nDeterioration in the economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, a domestic or worldwide financial downturn, or negative credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nEconomic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate, such as electric power generation, have experienced substantial deterioration in the past, resulting in reduced demand for natural gas. In addition, liquidity is essential to our business and developing our assets. Renewed or continued weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries we serve or that are served by our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity in a number of ways. For example:\n\u2022\ndemand for natural gas and electricity in the United States is impacted by industrial production, which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our natural gas business;\n\u2022\nthe tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect us, as our ability to receive payment for natural gas sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital for our business including for exploration and/or development of our natural gas reserves; and\n\u2022\na decline in our creditworthiness may require us to post letters of credit, cash collateral, or surety bonds to secure certain obligations, all of which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. As of January 18, 2019, we expect these transactions will represent approximately 376.0 Bcf of our estimated 2019 production at an average price of $2.71 per Mcf, 468.6 Bcf of our estimated 2020 production at an average price of $2.55 per Mcf, 410.3 Bcf of our estimated 2021 production at an average price of $2.44 per Mcf, 276.6 Bcf of our estimated 2022 production at an average price of $2.48 per Mcf, and 127.0 Bcf of our estimated 2023 production at an average price of $2.35 per Mcf. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the near-term benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. If we choose not to engage in hedging arrangements in the future, reduce our future use of hedging arrangements or are unable to engage in hedging arrangements due to lack of acceptable counterparties, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements to a greater extent than we do. Increases or decreases in forward market prices could result in material unrealized (non-cash) losses or gains on commodity derivative instruments resulting in volatility in reported earnings.\nIn addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to find available counterparties in the future with which to enter into hedges and counterparties able to enter into basis hedge contracts;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of our counterparties or their guarantors is substantially impaired; and\n\u2022\ncounterparties have credit limits that may constrain our ability to hedge additional volumes.\nExisting and future governmental laws, regulations and other legal requirements and judicial decisions that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our operations.\nThere are numerous governmental regulations applicable to the natural gas industry that are not directly related to environmental regulation, many of which are under constant review for amendment or expansion at the federal and state level. Any future modifications in such regulations, changes promulgated by the courts, or interruptions experienced in the operation of\nour governing bodies, may affect, among other things, our ability to develop the resource, obtain permits, as well as, potential impacts to the pricing or marketing of natural gas production.\nFor example, currently CNXM\u2019s gathering operations are exempt from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Natural Gas Act (NGA). Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of CNXM\u2019s facilities considered to be gathering facilities, CNXM believes that the natural gas pipelines in its gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a natural gas pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, this issue has been the subject of substantial litigation, and if FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would become subject to regulation by FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows for CNXM.\nAdditionally, some states have begun to adopt more stringent regulation and oversight of natural gas gathering lines than is currently required by federal standards. Pennsylvania, under Act 127, authorized Public Utility Commission (PUC) oversight of Class I gathering lines, and required standards and fees for Class II and Class III pipelines. The State of Ohio also moved to regulate natural gas gathering lines in a similar manner pursuant to Ohio Senate Bill 315 (SB315). SB315 expanded the Ohio PUC's authority over rural natural gas gathering lines. These changes in interpretation and regulation affect midstream activities of CNXM and other third-party providers with whom we interact, requiring changes in reporting, as well as increased costs.\nVarious judicial decisions that may directly or indirectly impact natural gas drilling could also serve to increase our cost of doing business or restrict our operations. For example, a recent Pennsylvania case currently on appeal involves concepts of landowner rights, trespass claims and the historic common law concept of \u201crule of capture.\u201d Although the case has not yet been resolved, the ultimate judicial outcome could negatively impact future shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania if the court finds that fracking could be considered trespassing in certain circumstances.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline operations and related increase in the regulation of gas gathering pipelines.\nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines and related facilities located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm, i.e., in \u201chigh consequence areas.\u201d The regulations require operators to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline and related facility integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\nShould our or CNXM's operations fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines, including civil penalties of up to $209,000 per violation, with a maximum of $2,909,022 for those related series of violations. In January 2017, PHMSA released a pre-publication copy of its final hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements. However, due to the change in Presidential administrations, PHMSA\u2019s final hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule has not yet taken effect, though PHMSA is expected to finalize its hazardous liquid pipeline safety in the near term. PHMSA\u2019s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all hazardous liquid gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines exempt from PHMSA regulations.\nPHMSA also issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators and in April 2016, published a Notice of Proposed Rule making that would significantly modify existing regulations related to reporting, impact, design, construction, maintenance, operations and integrity management of gas transmission and gathering pipelines. As proposed, compliance with the rule could have a material adverse effect on our or CNXM's operations. However, the ultimate impact of the rule on our and CNXM remains uncertain until the rulemaking is finalized. The adoption of these regulations, which apply more comprehensive or stringent safety standards than we are currently subject to, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us to incur increased operational costs that could be significant. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our cash flow.\nOur shale gas drilling and production operations require both adequate sources of water to use in the fracturing process, as well as the ability to dispose of, transport or recycle the water after hydraulic fracturing. Our CBM gas drilling and production operations also require the removal and disposal of water from the coal seams from which we produce gas. If we cannot find adequate sources of water for our use or we are unable to dispose of or recycle the water at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce natural gas economically and in sufficient quantities could be impaired.\nAs part of our drilling and production in shale formations, we use hydraulic fracturing processes. These processes require access to adequate sources of water, which may not be available in proximity to our operations or at certain times of the year. To ensure that we have adequate water available for our operations, we may be required to invest substantial amounts of capital in water pipelines which are used for relatively short periods of time. Increased regulation of these water pipelines could cause us to invest additional capital, alter our disposal or transportation method or affect our operations in other manners. Alternatively, we may be required to truck water, and we may not be able to contract for sufficient water hauling trucks to meet our needs.\nFurther, we must remove the portion of the water that flows back to the well bore, as well as drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. This water can be either disposed of or recycled for use in other hydraulic fracturing operations. In the event we are forced to dispose of water rather than recycle it, our costs may increase. In addition, in our CBM drilling and production, coal seams frequently contain water that must be removed and disposed of in order for the natural gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient amounts of water with respect to our shale operations, or the inability to dispose of or recycle water and other wastes used in our shale and our CBM operations in an economically efficient manner, could increase our costs and delay our operations, which will adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nFailure to find or acquire economically recoverable natural gas reserves to replace our current natural gas reserves will cause our levels of natural gas reserves and production to decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nProducing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Because total estimated proved reserves include our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018, production is expected to decline even if those proved undeveloped reserves are developed and the wells produce as expected. The rate of decline will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing, exploiting and selling our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional economically recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional economically recoverable reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs.\nIn addition, the level of natural gas and condensate volumes handled through the CNXM midstream systems depends on the level of production from natural gas wells dedicated to such midstream systems, which may be less than expected and which will naturally decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on CNXM\u2019s midstream systems, CNXM must obtain production from new wells completed by us and any third-party customers on acreage dedicated to the CNXM midstream systems or execute agreements with other third-parties in CNXM\u2019s areas of operation. CNXM has no control over producers\u2019 levels of development and completion activity in its areas of operations, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to CNXM\u2019s systems or the rate at which production from a well declines.\nThe provisions of our debt agreements and those of CNXM, and the risks associated therewith could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, CNX's total long-term indebtedness, excluding CNXM, was approximately $1.9 billion of which approximately (i) $1.3 billion was under our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022 plus $2.1 million of unamortized bond premium, (ii) $612.0 million was under our senior secured credit facility and (iii) $13.3 million of capitalized leases due through 2021. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our outstanding debt, which will limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development of our natural gas reserves or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower leverage and better access to capital resources; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to implement our business strategy.\nFurther, LIBOR and certain other interest rate \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. As a result of this transition, LIBOR may disappear entirely or perform differently than in the past, and interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected.\nOur senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our 5.875% senior unsecured notes limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness unless specified tests or exceptions are met. In addition, our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875% senior unsecured notes subject us to financial and/or other restrictive covenants. Under our senior secured credit agreement, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a maximum net leverage ratio and a minimum current ratio, as defined therein. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875% senior unsecured notes impose a number of restrictions upon us, such as restrictions on granting liens on our assets, making investments, paying dividends, stock repurchases, selling assets and engaging in acquisitions. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, CNXM\u2019s existing $600 million revolving credit facility and CNXM\u2019s $400 million of 6.50% senior notes, neither of which are guaranteed by CNX, subjects CNXM to certain financial and/or other restrictive covenants and other restrictions similar to those in our senior secured credit agreement and indentures.\nIf our or CNXM\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our respective debt service obligations, including repayment of such obligations at maturity, we or CNXM, as the case may be, may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our respective scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875% senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to sell assets and the use of the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur lenders use the loan value of our proved natural gas reserves to determine the borrowing base under our $2.1 billion senior secured credit facility. Our borrowing base could decrease for a variety of reasons including lower natural gas prices, declines in natural gas proved reserves, asset sales and lending requirements or regulations. Significant reductions in our borrowing base below $2.1 billion could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur ability to borrow and have letters of credit issued under our $2.1 billion senior secured credit facility is generally limited to a borrowing base. Our borrowing base is determined by the required number of lenders in good faith calculating a loan value of the Company\u2019s proved natural gas reserves. The borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility is currently $2.1 billion. Our borrowing base is redetermined by the lenders twice per year, and the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is expected to occur in the Spring of 2019. The various matters which we describe in other risk factors that can decrease our proved natural gas reserves including lower natural gas prices, operating difficulties, and failure to replace our proved reserves could also decrease our borrowing base. Please read: \u201cRisk Factors - We face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability\u201d and - \u201cUnless we replace our natural gas reserves, our natural gas reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d Our borrowing base could also decrease as a result of new lending requirements or regulations or the issuance of new indebtedness. If our borrowing base declined significantly below $2.1 billion, we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plans, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out our business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be required to repay any outstanding indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. We could face substantial liquidity problems, might not be able to access the equity or debt capital markets and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and those proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nChanges in federal or state income tax laws could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate.\nThe passage of legislation or any other changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas exploration and development. Any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, recent tax law changes effective as of the beginning of 2018 will limit the ability of corporations to take certain interest deductions and have eliminated a corporation\u2019s ability to take deductions for income attributable to domestic production activities.\nAdditionally, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the states in which we operate - primarily Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia - that would impose additional taxes or increase taxes on the production from our wells. The proposed tax rates have varied but would represent a greater financial burden on the economics of the wells we drill in these states.\nCyber-incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCyber-incidents, including cyber-attacks, may significantly affect us or the operations of our customers and business partners, as well as impact general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity. Strategic targets, including energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future incidents than other targets in the United States. A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption including environmental and safety issues resulting from a loss of control of field equipment and assets, and/or financial loss. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of natural gas reserves, monitor and control our field equipment and assets, and perform other activities related to our businesses. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-incident could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) based systems are potentially vulnerable to targeted cyber-attacks due to their critical role in operations.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, data centers and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-incidents or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nDeliberate attacks on our assets, or security breaches in our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third-parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, damage to our reputation, other operational disruptions and third-party liability, including the following:\n\u2022\na cyber-incident impacting one of our vendors or service providers could result in supply chain disruptions, loss or corruption of our information or other negative consequences, any of which could delay or halt development of additional infrastructure, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u2022\na cyber-incident related to our facilities may result in equipment damage or failure;\n\u2022\na cyber-incident impacting midstream or downstream pipelines could prevent our product from being delivered, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022\na cyber-incident impacting a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u2022\na deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our units.\nOur implementation of various internal and externally-facing controls and processes, including appropriate internal risk assessment and internal policy implementation, globally incorporating a risk-based cyber security framework to monitor and mitigate security threats and other strategies to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure is costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches or other cyber-incidents from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nConstruction of new gathering, compression, dehydration, treating or other midstream assets by CNXM may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect CNXM\u2018s cash flows, results of operations and our financial condition.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to CNXM\u2019s existing systems involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond its control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If these projects are undertaken, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all.\nRevenues may not increase immediately (or at all) upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if a processing facility is built, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and CNXM may not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed. Additionally, facilities may be constructed to capture anticipated future production growth in an area in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new gathering, compression, dehydration, treating or other midstream assets may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve the expected investment return, which could adversely affect CNXM\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.\nThe construction of additions to CNXM\u2019s existing assets may require it to obtain new rights-of-way prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities, which may not be obtained in a timely fashion or in a way that allows CNXM to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering pipelines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, including eco-terrorism, and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could affect the energy industry, the environment and industry related economic conditions, including our operations and the operations of our customers, as well as general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity. Strategic targets, including energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States. The occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences.\nWe may operate a portion of our business with one or more joint venture partners or in circumstances where we are not the operator, which may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility; actions taken by the other partner or third-party operator may materially impact our financial position and results of operations; and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from a joint venture.\nAs is common in the natural gas industry, we may operate one or more of our properties with a joint venture partner, or contract with a third-party to control operations. These relationships could require us to share operational and other control, such that we may no longer have the flexibility to control completely the development of these properties. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments in such circumstances, our rights to participate may be adversely affected. If a joint venture partner is unable or fails to pay its portion of development costs or if a third-party operator does not operate in accordance with our expectations,\nour costs of operations could be increased. We could also incur liability as a result of actions taken by a joint venture partner or third-party operator. Disputes between us and the other party may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nWe do not completely control the timing of divestitures that we plan to engage in and they may not provide anticipated benefits. Additionally, we may be unable to acquire additional properties in the future and any acquired properties may not provide the anticipated benefits.\nOur business and financing plans include divesting certain assets over time. However, we do not completely control the timing of divestitures, and delays in completing divestitures may reduce the benefits we may receive from them, such as elimination of management distraction by selling non-core assets and the receipt of cash proceeds that contribute to our liquidity. Additionally, if assets are held jointly with another party, we may not be permitted to dispose of these assets without the consent of our joint venture partner. Also, there can be no assurance that the assets we divest will produce anticipated proceeds. In addition, the terms of divestitures may cause a substantial portion of the benefits we anticipate receiving from them to be subject to future matters that we do not control.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that complement or expand our current business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire the identified targets. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations and to identify and appropriately manage any liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition. The process of integrating acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our failure to make acquisitions in the future and successfully integrate the acquired businesses or assets into our existing operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCNX and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are party to a number of legal proceedings in the normal course of business activities. Defending these actions, especially purported class actions, can be costly, and can distract management. For example, we are a defendant in pending purported class action lawsuits dealing with claimants\u2019 alleged entitlements to, and accounting for, natural gas royalties. There is also the possibility that we may become involved in future suits, including, for example, those being brought by communities against fossil fuel producers relating to climate change, which are beginning to gain prevalence in the courts. There is the potential that the costs of defending litigation in an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. See Note 18- Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of pending legal proceedings.\nThere is no guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our current or any future share repurchase program at levels undertaken previously or at all. Any determinations to repurchase shares of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of all relevant considerations.\nWe previously announced a one-year $200 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in September 2017, amended to increase the program to $450 million on October 30, 2017 and extended on July 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018. On October 26, 2018, our board of directors approved an additional $300 million share repurchase authorization, which is not subject to an expiration date. The repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares. Our board of director\u2019s determination to repurchase shares of our common stock will depend upon market conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant. Based on an evaluation of these factors, our board of directors may determine not to repurchase shares or to repurchase shares at reduced levels from those anticipated by our shareholders.\nNegative public perception regarding our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding our industry resulting from, among other things, operational incidents or concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, emissions and pipeline projects, could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, which could then result in additional laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations, at the federal or state level. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nIn connection with the separation, CONSOL Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify CONSOL Energy for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to CONSOL Energy, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The CONSOL Energy indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which CONSOL Energy has been allocated responsibility, and CONSOL Energy may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with CONSOL Energy, CONSOL Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify CONSOL Energy for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. More specifically, CONSOL Energy assumed all liabilities related to their current and our former coal business, including liabilities having a book value of $955 million and liabilities that may arise due to the failure of purchasers of coal assets that we had previously disposed. Additionally, we remain liable as a guarantor on certain liabilities that were assumed by CONSOL Energy in connection with the separation. The estimated value of these guarantees was approximately $192 million at the time of the separation. Although CONSOL Energy agreed to indemnify us to the extent that we are called upon to pay any of these liabilities, there is no assurance that CONSOL Energy will satisfy its obligations to indemnify us in these situations. For example, we could be liable for liabilities assumed by Murray Energy and its subsidiaries (Murray Energy) in connection with the disposition of certain mines to Murray Energy in 2013 in the event that both Murray Energy and CONSOL Energy are unable to satisfy those liabilities.\nIndemnities that we may be required to provide CONSOL Energy are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that CONSOL Energy has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. Further, the indemnity from CONSOL Energy may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and CONSOL Energy may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CONSOL Energy any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe separation of CONSOL Energy could result in substantial tax liability.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the distribution, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, the distribution may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us and our shareholders as a result of certain post-distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of CNX or CONSOL Energy. The possibility of rendering the distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of our business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with CONSOL Energy, CONSOL Energy may be required to indemnify us against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of CONSOL Energy, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether CONSOL Energy participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of CONSOL Energy stock other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of its businesses, (v) other actions or failures to act by CONSOL Energy or (vi) any of CONSOL Energy\u2019s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinions of tax advisors being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from CONSOL Energy may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and CONSOL Energy may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CONSOL Energy any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect CNX\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86799, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CNX"}
