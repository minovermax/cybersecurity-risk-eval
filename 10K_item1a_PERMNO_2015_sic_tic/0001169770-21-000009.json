Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is subject to certain risks. These risk factors should be considered by prospective and current investors in our securities when evaluating the disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\n\u2022Adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022New lines of business, new products and services, or

material adverse impact on us.\n\u2022Any breach of representations and warranties made by us to our residential mortgage loan purchasers or credit default on our loan sales may require us to repurchase such loans.\n\u2022Impairment charges in our investment securities portfolio could result in losses and adversely affect our continuing operations.\n\u2022Collateralized loan obligations represent a significant portion of our assets.\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected by credit risk and other factors affecting our commercial real estate and multifamily loan portfolio.\n\u2022Our business is subject to interest rate risk.\n\u2022Uncertainty relating to the LIBOR transition process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nFunding and Liquidity Risks\n\u2022If our investments in other real estate owned are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced.\n\u2022Repayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower and the collateral securing these loans, if any, may not be sufficient to repay the loan in the event of default.\n\u2022Inability to develop and maintain a strong core deposit base or low cost funding sources.\n\u2022Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations.\n\u2022We may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that additional capital may not be available when it is needed or on acceptable terms.\n\u2022Our holding company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its income and as the primary source of funds for cash dividends to our stockholders, which is subject to regulatory approval and may be limited.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\n\u2022The costs and effects of litigation.\n\u2022Changes in tax laws, or audits from tax authorities, could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be affected adversely by changes in laws, rules and regulations governing our operations, including changes in accounting standards, or by failure to obtain regulatory approvals for capital actions.\n\u2022Rulemaking changes may result in higher regulatory and compliance costs.\n\u2022Non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, could result in fines or sanctions or operating restrictions.\n\u2022The Volcker Rule covered fund provisions could adversely affect us.\nRisks Relating

control of our borrowers.\n\u2022A worsening in economic conditions in the market areas we serve may impact our earnings adversely and could increase the credit risk of our loan portfolio.\n\u2022Strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\n\u2022Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist stockholders.\n\u2022Short sellers of our stock may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nThe foregoing summary of risks should be read in conjunction with the more detailed Risk Factors below and is not an exhaustive summary of all risks facing our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be,\nadversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. We cannot predict at this time the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. The extent of any continued or future adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, customers, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to (i) increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures; (ii) sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (iii) ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including commercial real estate and multifamily; (iv) significant reductions in the targeted federal funds rate (which was reduced to a target rate of between zero and 0.25% in the first quarter of 2020); and (v) heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements. In addition, we also face an increased risk of client disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nWe are prioritizing the safety of our clients and employees, and have temporarily closed a small number of branches and are operating with limited branch hours at others. Additionally, over 75% of our employees are working remotely. If these measures are not effective in serving our customers or affect the productivity of our employees, they may lead to significant disruptions in our business operations.\nMany of our counterparties and third-party service providers have also been, and likely further will be, affected by \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services. As a result, our operational and other risks are generally expected to increase until the pandemic subsides.\nWe are actively engaged with borrowers who are seeking payment relief and waiving certain fees for impacted clients. One method we have deployed is offering forbearance or deferment to qualifying clients making such requests. For SFR loans, the deferments are 90 days in length, subject to extension, and are patterned after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines.\nWith respect to our non-SFR loan portfolio, deferments are also 90 days in length and subject to extension. These assistance efforts may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, if such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on borrowers, we may experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods.\nOur earnings and cash flows are dependent to a large degree on net interest income (the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings). Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest. The significant reductions to the federal funds rate have led to a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, in some cases declining below zero. If interest rates are reduced further in response to COVID-19, we expect that our net interest income will decline, perhaps significantly. The overall effect of lower interest rates cannot be predicted at this time and depends on future actions the Federal Reserve may take to increase or reduce the targeted federal funds rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting economic conditions.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and market conditions have increased demands on our liquidity as we meet our clients\u2019 needs. In addition, economic forecasts and market conditions have, and may among other things, negatively affect our capital and leverage levels and ratios, increase our provision for credit losses and negatively impact the fair value of our investment portfolio. If these adverse developments persist, our capital and leverage ratios, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken unprecedented measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the negative effects of COVID-19 or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\nOther negative effects of COVID-19 that may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time, but it is likely that our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected until the pandemic subsides and the U.S. economy begins to recover. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section. Until the pandemic subsides, we may experience increased draws on credit facilities and we expect continued pressure on new loan production, reduced revenues from our lending businesses and increased credit losses in our lending portfolios. Even after the pandemic subsides, it is possible that the U.S. and other major economies may experience a recession, which we expect would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations.\nNew lines of business, new products and services, or strategic project initiatives may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results. New lines of business and/or new products or services also could subject us to additional regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny by our regulators and other legal risks.\nAdditionally, from time to time we undertake strategic project initiatives. Significant effort and resources are necessary to manage and oversee the successful completion of these initiatives. These initiatives often place significant demands on a limited number of employees with subject matter expertise and management and may involve significant costs to implement as well as increase operational risk as employees learn to process transactions under new systems. The failure to properly execute on these strategic initiatives could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur cyber-security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate losses or exposure to cyber-attack or cyber theft.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our client relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks are vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access either directly or indirectly through our vendors, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and other types of cyber-attacks. Such risks have increased with the work-from-home arrangements implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our clients' confidential and other information that we process and store, or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or the operations of our clients or counterparties. The occurrence of cyber-attacks may require us to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through our current insurance policies. If a cyber-attack succeeds in disrupting our operations or disclosing confidential data, we could also suffer significant reputational damage in addition to possible regulatory fines or client lawsuits.\nWe provide internet banking services to our clients which have additional cyber risks related to our client\u2019s personal electronic devices and electronic communication. Any compromise of personal electronic device security could jeopardize the confidential information of our clients (including user names and passwords) and expose our clients to account take-overs (ATO) and the\npossibility for financial crimes such as fraud or identity theft and deter clients from using our internet banking services. We rely on and employ industry-standard tools and processes to safeguard data. These precautions may not protect our systems from future vulnerabilities, data breaches or other cyber threats. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions.\nWhile we have established policies and technical controls to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there are no absolute assurances that such events will not occur or that the resulting damages will be adequately mitigated.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems.\nWe outsource certain aspects of our data processing and operational functions to third party providers. If our third party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on third party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our online banking services and data processing systems.\nWe rely on third party providers to help ensure the confidentiality of our client information and acknowledge the additional risks these third parties expose us to. Third party providers may experience unauthorized access to and disclosure of our consumer or client information or result in the destruction or corruption of company information. In addition, we may be exposed indirectly through our third party providers who may experience their own cyber breach and as a result compromise our data and/or lead to service interruptions. Any failure or interruption, or breaches in security, of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan origination and servicing systems, thereby harming our business reputation, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could lead existing clients to terminate their banking relationships with us and could make it more difficult for us to attract new banking clients in the future.\nTo the extent we acquire other banks, bank branches, other assets or other businesses, we may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent with such acquisitions.\nAcquiring other banks, bank branches, other assets or other businesses involves various risks, including the risks of incorrectly assessing the credit quality of acquired assets, encountering greater than expected costs of integrating acquired banks, branches or businesses, the risk of loss of clients and/or employees of the acquired bank, branch or business, executing cost savings measures, not achieving revenue enhancements and otherwise not realizing the transaction\u2019s anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. There is also the risk that the requisite regulatory approvals might not be received and other conditions to consummation of a transaction might not be satisfied during the anticipated timeframes, or at all. In addition, pursuing an acquisition may divert resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations, may require investment in integration and in development and enhancement of additional operational and reporting processes and controls, and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nWe face significant operational risks.\nWe operate many different financial service functions and rely on the ability of our employees, third party vendors and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees\u2019 execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems. These risks have increased in light of work-from-home arrangements implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established comprehensive policies and procedures and an internal control framework designed to provide a sound operational environment for the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk (interest rate and price risks), liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our current and future risk management strategies, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. In\ncertain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and predict risks. However, these models are inherently limited because they involve techniques, including the use of historical data in some circumstances, and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. There is no assurance that these models will appropriately capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. Accurate and timely enterprise-wide risk information is necessary to enhance management\u2019s decision-making in times of crisis. If our enterprise risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our enterprise risk framework to address those changes. If our enterprise risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining clients, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, regulatory investigations, marketplace rumors and questionable or fraudulent activities of our clients. We have policies and procedures in place to promote ethical conduct and protect our reputation. However, these policies and procedures may not be fully effective and cannot adequately protect against all threats to our reputation. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or clients, with or without merit, may result in the loss of clients, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental oversight.\nIf the public perception of financial institutions remains negative, then our reputation and business may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our business and personnel, whether or not accurate or true. Such information may be posted on social medial or other Internet forums or published by news organizations and the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity.\nWe depend on key management personnel.\nOur success will, to a large extent, depend on the continued employment of our key management personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, no assurance can be given that these individuals, or any of our key management personnel, will continue to be employed by us. The loss of any of these individuals could negatively affect our ability to achieve our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor's organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by the third party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us.\nWe have a net deferred tax asset that may or may not be fully realized.\nWe have a net DTA and cannot assure that it will be fully realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities computed using enacted tax rates. If we determine that we will not achieve sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax asset, we are required under GAAP to establish a full or partial valuation allowance. If we determine that a valuation allowance is necessary, we are required to incur a charge to operations. We regularly assess available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. Realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently speculative because it requires estimates that cannot be made with certainty. As of December 31, 2020, we had a net DTA of $46.0 million. For additional information, see Note 14 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\nRisks Related to Interest Rate and Credit\nIf actual losses on our loans exceed our estimates used to establish our allowance for credit losses, our business, financial condition and profitability may suffer.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and the loss and delinquency experience, and evaluate economic conditions and make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates are incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan losses. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, fraud and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for credit losses was 1.43% of total loans held-for-investment and 229.91% of nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2020. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs (which will in turn also require an increase in the provision for credit losses if the charge-offs exceed the allowance for credit losses), based on judgments different than that of management. Any increases in the provision for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020, substantially changes the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard changed the previous incurred loss impairment methodology in GAAP with a methodology that reflects lifetime expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information for credit loss estimates. CECL is generally thought to result in the earlier recognition of credit losses in financial statements. Under the incurred loss model, we recognized losses when they were incurred. CECL represents a departure from the incurred loss model. CECL requires loans held for investment and held-to-maturity securities to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected (net of the allowance for credit losses). CECL also requires credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. In addition, the measurement of expected credit losses takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet (with periodic updates thereafter) and is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe CECL model materially impacts how we determine our allowance for credit losses and required us to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, we may experience more fluctuations in our allowance for credit losses, which may be significant. We have developed our models to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on our loans primarily using a lifetime loss methodology. We have used these models to execute our process for estimating the allowance for credit losses under the new standard and have developed an appropriate governance process for our estimate of expected credit losses under the new standard. The adoption of this standard has been applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.\nFuture provisions under the CECL model could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. It is also possible that our ongoing lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption. The FRB, OCC and FDIC have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a five-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. We adopted this phase in option during 2020.\nThere are risks associated with our lending activities and our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb actual incurred losses in our loan portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022Cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022In the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral;\n\u2022The credit history of a particular borrower;\n\u2022Changes in interest rates;\n\u2022Changes in economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022The duration of the loan.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022An ongoing review of the quality, size and diversity of the loan portfolio;\n\u2022Evaluation of nonperforming loans;\n\u2022Historical default and loss experience;\n\u2022Historical recovery experience;\n\u2022Existing and forecasted economic conditions;\n\u2022Risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans; and\n\u2022The amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property and declining property values.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.26 billion, or 21.4% of our total loans held-for-investment, was secured by SFR mortgage loans and HELOCs, as compared with $1.64 billion, or 27.6% of our total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2019. This type of lending is particularly sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the California housing markets may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios generally will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, the borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses, which will in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our level of adjustable rate loans.\nA substantial majority of our real estate secured loans held are adjustable rate loans. Any rise in prevailing market interest rates may result in increased payments for some borrowers who have adjustable rate mortgage loans, increasing the possibility of defaults.\nOur underwriting practices may not protect us against losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices, including: analyzing a borrower\u2019s credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuing collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and verifying liquid assets. Notwithstanding these practices, we have incurred losses on loans that have met these criteria, and may continue to experience higher than expected losses depending on economic factors and borrower behavior. In addition, our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our clients may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our clients become less predictive of future behaviors, or in the case of borrower fraud. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a charge-off of $13.9 million, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15 million dollar line of credit originated in February 2018 to a borrower that made false representations and provided false documentation to us. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $35.8 million, primarily attributable to a $35.1 million line of credit originated in November 2017 to a borrower who was purportedly the subject of a fraudulent scheme. We are actively evaluating all available sources of recovery, although no assurance can be given that we will be successful in that regard. Finally, we may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. As of December 31, 2020, 73.2% of our commercial real estate loans, 77.9% of our multifamily loans and 67.9% of our originated SFR mortgage loans were secured by collateral in southern California. Deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in southern California could result in significantly higher credit losses to our portfolio.\nOur non-traditional and interest only SFR loans expose us to increased lending risk.\nMany of the residential mortgage loans we have originated for investment consist of non-traditional SFR mortgage loans that do not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines as a result of loan-to-value ratios or debt-to-income ratios, loan terms, loan size (exceeding agency limits) or other exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines. Moreover, many of these loans do not meet the qualified mortgage definition established by the CFPB, and therefore contain additional regulatory and legal risks. See \u201cRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB in particular have resulted in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\u201d In addition, the secondary market\ndemand for nonconforming mortgage loans generally is limited, and consequently, we may have a difficult time selling the nonconforming loans in our portfolio should we decide to do so.\nIn the case of interest only loans, a borrower\u2019s monthly payment is subject to change when the loan converts to fully-amortizing status. Since the borrower\u2019s monthly payment may increase by a substantial amount, even without an increase in prevailing market interest rates, the borrower might not be able to afford the increased monthly payment. In addition, interest only loans have a large, balloon payment at the end of the loan term, which the borrower may be unable to pay. Negative amortization involves a greater risk to us because credit risk exposure increases when the loan incurs negative amortization and the value of the home serving as collateral for the loan does not increase proportionally. Negative amortization is only permitted up to 110% of the original loan to value ratio during the first five years the loan is outstanding, with payments adjusting periodically as provided in the loan documents, potentially resulting in higher payments by the borrower. The adjustment of these loans to higher payment requirements can be a substantial factor in higher loan delinquency levels because the borrowers may not be able to make the higher payments. Also, real estate values may decline, and credit standards may tighten in concert with the higher payment requirement, making it difficult for borrowers to sell their homes or refinance their loans to pay off their mortgage obligations. For these reasons, interest only loans and negative amortization loans are considered to have an increased risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure than conforming loans and may result in higher levels of realized losses. Our interest only loans decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, to $401.6 million, or 6.8% of our total loans held-for-investment from $545.4 million, or 9.2% of our total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2019.\nRepayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may not be sufficient to repay the loan in the event of default.\nWe make our commercial and industrial loans primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Collateral securing commercial and industrial loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise and fluctuate in value and in the event we are required to assume direct responsibility for the collateral, including but not limited to residential mortgage loans in the case of warehouse credit facilities that we provide to non-bank financial institutions, our allowance for credit losses may increase, which may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect the amounts due from its clients. As of December 31, 2020, our commercial and industrial loans totaled $2.09 billion, or 35.3% of our total loans held-for-investment.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties acquired.\nIn prior years, due to weakness of the U.S. economy and, more specifically, the California economy, including higher levels of unemployment than the nationwide average and declines in real estate values, certain borrowers have been unable to meet their loan repayment obligations and, as a result, we have had to initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to and take title to a number of real properties that had collateralized their loans. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even though we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nSecondary mortgage market conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are subject to investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and investor yield requirements for those loans and securities. These conditions may fluctuate or even worsen in the future.\nFrom time to time, as part of our balance sheet management process, we may also sell SFR loans and other types of mortgage loans from our portfolio, including multifamily loans. We may use the proceeds of loan sales for generating new loans or for other purposes. If secondary mortgage market conditions were to deteriorate in the future and we cannot sell loans at our desired levels, our balance sheet management objectives might not be met. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected.\nAny breach of representations and warranties made by us to our loan purchasers or credit default on our loan sales may require us to repurchase loans we have sold.\nWe have sold or securitized loans we originated into the secondary market pursuant to agreements that generally require us to repurchase loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by us to the loan purchaser. Any fraud or\nmisrepresentation during the loan origination process, whether by us, the borrower, or other party in the transaction, or, in some cases, upon any early payment default on such loans, may require us to repurchase such loans.\nWe believe that, as a result of the increased defaults and foreclosures during the last recession resulting in increased demand for repurchases and indemnification in the secondary market, many purchasers of loans are particularly sensitive to obtaining indemnification or the requirement of originators to repurchase loans, and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies they may have. Our exposure to repurchases under our representations and warranties could include the current unpaid balance of all loans we have sold. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we sold multifamily and SFR mortgage loans aggregating $17.4 million, $1.13 billion, and $14.5 million. To recognize the potential loan repurchase or indemnification losses on all SFR mortgage and multifamily loans sold in 2019 and prior to 2019, we maintained a total reserve of $5.5 million as of December 31, 2020. Increases to this reserve as a result of the sale of loans are a reduction in our gain on the sale of loans. Increases and decreases to this reserve subsequent to the sale are included as a component of noninterest expense. The determination of the appropriate level of the reserve inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make estimates of repurchase and indemnification risks and expected losses. The estimates used could be inaccurate, resulting in a level of reserve that is less than actual losses.\nDeterioration in the economy, an increase in interest rates or a decrease in home and collateral values could increase client defaults on loans that were sold and increase demand for repurchases and indemnification and increase our losses from loan repurchases and indemnification. If we are required to indemnify loan purchasers or repurchase loans and incur losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims asserted against us in the future by loan purchasers may result in liabilities or legal expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCredit impairment in our investment securities portfolio could result in losses and adversely affect our continuing operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.23 billion of securities available-for-sale, as compared with $912.6 million of securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, securities available-for-sale that were in an unrealized loss position had a total fair value of $725.6 million with unrealized losses of $10.0 million. These unrealized losses related primarily to collateralized loan obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, securities available-for-sale that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of $859.3 million and aggregate unrealized losses of $17.0 million.\nThe Company monitors to ensure it has adequate credit support and, as of December 31, 2020 we believed there was no credit losses and did not have the intent to sell any of its securities in an unrealized loss position and it is likely that it will not be required to sell such securities before their anticipated recovery. Beginning January 1, 2020, available-for-sale debt securities are analyzed for credit losses under ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires the Company to determine whether impairment exists as of the reporting date and whether that impairment is due to credit losses. An allowance for credit losses is established for losses on available-for-sale debt securities due to credit losses and is reported as a component of provision for credit losses. Accrued interest is excluded from our expected credit loss estimates. For more information about ASC 326, see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\nPrior to January 1, 2020, our portfolio was evaluated using either OTTI guidance provided by FASB ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, or ASC 325, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests that Continue to be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity were generally evaluated for OTTI under ASC 320. However, certain purchased beneficial interests, including non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, that had credit ratings at the time of purchase below AA were evaluated using the model outlined in ASC 325. The collateralized loan obligations in our portfolio referenced above were rated AA or above at purchase and are not within the scope of ASC 325.\nWe previously recorded a loss of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 following our decision to sell our entire CMBS portfolio, which was completed in January 2019. We also recorded a loss of $731 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of our decision to sell its U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise residential mortgage-backed securities.\nWe closely monitor our investment securities for changes in credit risk. The valuation of our investment securities also is influenced by external market and other factors, including implementation of SEC and FASB guidance on fair value accounting. Accordingly, if market conditions deteriorate further and we determine our holdings of other investment securities have experienced credit losses, our future earnings, stockholders\u2019 equity, regulatory capital and continuing operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCollateralized loan obligations represent a significant portion of our assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, based on fair value, $677.8 million, or 8.6% of our total assets, was invested in CLOs. Our CLO portfolio consists entirely of variable rate securities, which we believe supports our interest rate risk management strategy by lowering the extension risk and duration risk inherent to certain fixed rate investment securities. However, in a decreasing interest rate environment, our interest income may be negatively impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2020, based on amortized cost, $24.0 million of our CLO holdings were AAA rated and $663.5 million were AA rated. As of December 31, 2020, there were no CLOs rated below AA and none of the CLOs were subject to ratings downgrade in 2020. All of our CLOs are floating rate, with rates set on a quarterly basis at three month LIBOR plus a spread.\nAs an investor in CLOs, we purchase specific tranches of debt instruments that are secured by professionally managed portfolios of senior secured loans to corporations. CLOs are not secured by residential or commercial mortgages. CLO managers are typically large non-bank financial institutions or banks. CLOs are typically $300 million to $1 billion in size, contain 100 or more loans, and have five to six credit tranches including AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, and B and an equity tranche. Interest and principal are typically paid to the AAA tranche first then move down the capital stack. Losses are typically borne by the equity tranche first then move up the capital stack. CLOs typically have subordination levels that range from approximately 33% to 39% for AAA, 20% to 28% for AA, 15% to 18% for A and 10% to 14% for BBB. The market value of CLOs may be affected by, among other things, perceived changes in the economy, performance by the manager and performance of the underlying loans.\nThe CLOs we currently hold may, from time to time, not be actively traded, and under certain market conditions may be relatively illiquid investments, and volatility in the CLO trading market may cause the value of these investments to decline. Although we attempt to mitigate the credit and liquidity risks associated with CLOs by purchasing CLOs with credit ratings of AA or higher and by maintaining a pre-purchase due diligence and ongoing review process by a dedicated credit administration team, no assurance can be given that these risk mitigation efforts will be successful. A deterioration in market conditions and decline in the market value of CLOs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and stockholders' equity.\nOur income property loans, consisting of commercial real estate and multifamily loans, involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.\nWe originate commercial real estate and multifamily loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans, and repayment is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower\u2019s project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed in a timely manner or at all, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.\nCommercial real estate and multifamily loans also expose us to credit risk because the collateral securing these loans often cannot be sold easily. In addition, many of our commercial real estate and multifamily loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment.\nIf we foreclose on a commercial real estate or multifamily loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, commercial real estate and multifamily loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate and multifamily loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Our commercial real estate and multifamily loans decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, to $2.10 billion, or 35.6% of our total loans held-for-investment from $2.31 billion, or 38.9% of our total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2019.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may hurt our profits.\nTo be profitable, we have to earn more money in interest that we receive on loans and investments than we pay to our depositors and lenders in interest. If interest rates rise, our net interest income and the value of our assets could be reduced if interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, increases more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, such as loans, and investment securities. This is most likely to occur if short-term interest rates increase at a faster rate than long-term interest rates, which would cause our net interest income to go down. In addition, rising interest rates may hurt our income, because that may reduce the demand for loans and the value of our securities. In a rapidly changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage our interest rate risk effectively, which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR transition process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the benchmark administrator for the U.S. Dollar LIBOR announced a proposal to extend the publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in \u201cnew\u201d contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with clients over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nFunding and Liquidity Risks\nWe may not be able to develop and maintain a strong core deposit base or other low cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of deposits as the primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to expand core deposits, to provide a less costly and stable source of funding. The deposit markets are competitive, and therefore it may prove difficult to grow our core deposit base.\nBeginning in 2019, the Bank focused on remixing the deposit base towards core relationship deposits. The Bank experienced net deposit outflows from high-rate large balance accounts (defined as $100 million or more in balances) primarily in the former Institutional Banking business unit.\nThe Bank increased its focus and attention toward expanding its core relationship deposit business, including recruiting sales and product personnel and adding subject matter expertise. The competitive landscape for deposits continued throughout 2020. Outflows were offset by new account and client acquisitions. In a competitive market, depositors have many choices as to where to place their deposit accounts. As the Bank continues to grow its core deposit base and seeks to reduce its exposure to high rate/high volatility accounts, it may experience a net deposit outflow, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general.\nFactors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on acceptable terms.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At some point, we may need to raise additional capital to support continued growth.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, our financial performance and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur holding company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its income and as the primary source of funds for cash dividends to our preferred and common stockholders.\nOur primary source of revenue at the holding company level is dividends from the Bank and we also have previously relied on the net proceeds of capital raising transactions as the primary source of funds for cash dividends to our preferred and common stockholders. To the extent the holding company is limited in the amount of dividends the Bank pays to the holding company or in its ability to raise capital in the future, the holding company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders could likewise be limited.\nThe OCC regulates and, in some cases, must approve the amounts the Bank pays as dividends to us. Currently, the Bank does not have sufficient dividend-paying capacity to declare and pay such dividends to us without obtaining prior approval from the OCC under applicable regulations, which requires prior approval if a cash dividend would exceed the sum of current period net income and retained earnings from the past two years, after deducting dividends previously declared (among other amounts). Further, the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends can be restricted or eliminated if the Bank does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement or for other supervisory reasons. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company, then we may not be able to service our debt, including our senior notes and subordinated notes, pay our other obligations or pay cash dividends on our preferred and common stock. Our inability to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and the value of your investment in our securities.\nThere can be no assurance as to the level of dividends we may pay on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and there may be circumstances under which we would eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve issued Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Letter SR-09-4, which reiterates and heightens expectations that bank holding companies inform and consult with Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid. If the Company experiences losses in a series of consecutive quarters, it may be required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring or paying any dividends. In this event, there can be no assurance that the Company's regulators will approve the payment of such dividends.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe are a party to a variety of litigation and other actions.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation pertaining to fiduciary and other claims and legal proceedings. Currently, there are certain legal proceedings pending against us in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, we believe that any liabilities arising from pending legal matters would be immaterial based on information currently available. However, if actual results differ from our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For a detailed discussion on current legal proceedings, see Item 3 -Legal Proceedings, and Note 28 - Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\nChanges in federal, state or local tax laws, or audits from tax authorities, could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, includes a number of provisions impacting the banking industry and the borrowers and the market for residential and commercial real estate. Changes include a lower limit on the deductibility of interest on residential mortgage loans and home equity loans; a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense; a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes, etc. The law's limitation on the mortgage interest deduction and state and local tax deduction for individual taxpayers has increased the after-tax cost of owning a home for many of our existing clients. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which\nwould reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, these changes implemented by this tax law could make some businesses and industries less inclined to borrow, potentially reducing demand for our commercial loan products. Finally, we may be negatively impacted more than our competitors because our business strategy focuses on California, which has a higher cost real estate market compared to other states.\nWe are also subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess regularly the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our operations and income may be adversely affected by changes in laws, rules and regulations governing our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. FRB policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that we hold, such as debt securities, certain mortgage loans held-for-sale and MSRs. Its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us. Changes in policies of the FRB are beyond our control and the impact of changes in those policies on our activities and results of operations can be difficult to predict.\nThe Company and the Bank are heavily regulated. This oversight is to protect depositors, the federal DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not stockholders or debt holders. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose increased capital requirements and restrictions on a bank\u2019s operations, to reclassify assets, to determine the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and to set the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed.\nCongress, state legislatures and federal and state agencies continually review banking, lending and other laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. We face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the introduction of new regulations or modifications of existing regulations, which could require us to hold more capital or liquidity or have other adverse effects on our businesses or profitability. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation, that applies to us or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any new laws, rules and regulations including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) could make compliance more difficult, expensive, costly to implement or may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or growth prospects. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nThe CFPB is an independent federal agency with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions, their affiliates, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies if the assets of the institution exceed the $10 billion threshold. As a smaller financial institution with assets under $10 billion, we are generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the OCC with respect to compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. However, we are still subject to regulations issued by the CFPB.\nCompliance with the rules and policies adopted by the CFPB has limited the products we may permissibly offer to some or all of our clients, or limited the terms on which those products may be issued, or may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted. We may also be required to add compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on\nmerger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions or operating restrictions.\nWe are subject to government legislation and regulation, including but not limited to the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts, which require financial institutions to develop programs to detect money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. If detected, financial institutions are obligated to report such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury. These regulations require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of clients and beneficial owners of clients that establish and maintain a relationship with a financial institution. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines, sanctions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our strategic initiatives and operating results, and could require us to make changes to our operations and the clients that we serve. Several banking institutions have received large fines, or suffered limitations on their operations, for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Although we have developed policies, procedures and processes designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in detecting violations of these laws and regulations.\nOur federal regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities over our operations and compliance with the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts. Any new laws and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business. One aspect of our business that we believe presents risks in this particular area is the conflict between federal and state law, including but not limited to cannabis and cannabis related businesses, which are legal in the State of California and prohibited by federal law. If our risk management and compliance programs prove to be ineffective, incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected losses and/or incur fines, penalties or restrictions to operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. As part of our federal regulators' enforcement authority, significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, consent orders, or other regulatory actions can be assessed against the Bank. Such actions could require us to make changes to our operations, including the clients that we serve, and may have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe Volcker Rule covered fund provisions could adversely affect us.\nThe so-called \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d (adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act) restricts our ability to sponsor or invest in \u201ccovered funds\u201d (as defined in the applicable regulations). The Volcker Rule excludes from the definition of \u201ccovered fund\u201d loan securitizations that meet specified investment criteria and do not invest in impermissible assets. Accordingly, investments in CLOs that qualify for the loan securitization exclusion are not prohibited by the Volcker Rule. It is our practice to invest only in CLOs that meet the Volcker Rule\u2019s definition of permissible loan securitizations and therefore are Volcker Rule compliant. However, the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations are relatively new and untested, and it is possible that certain CLOs in which we have invested may be found subsequently to be covered funds. If so, we may be required to divest our interest in nonconforming CLOs, and we could incur losses on such divestitures.\nRisks Relating to Markets and External Factors\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters such as earthquakes and wildfires, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their outstanding loans, cause significant property damage or otherwise impair the value of collateral securing our loans, and result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have established disaster recovery and business continuity plans and procedures, and we monitor the effects of any such events on our loans, properties and investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on us or our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are dependent on the national and local economy, particularly in the Bank\u2019s market areas. A worsening in economic conditions in the market areas we serve may impact our earnings adversely and could increase the credit risk of our loan portfolio.\nWe cannot accurately predict the possibility of the national or local economy\u2019s return to recessionary conditions or to a period of economic weakness, which would adversely impact the markets we serve. Our primary market area is concentrated in the greater Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and Santa Barbara counties. Adverse economic conditions in any of these areas can reduce our rate of growth, affect our clients\u2019 ability to repay loans and adversely impact our financial condition and earnings. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may affect our profitability adversely.\nA deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022Demand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022Loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022Collateral for our loans may decline in value; and\n\u2022The amount of our low cost or noninterest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, non-bank lenders, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater name recognition, resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services or prices for services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our markets.\nIn addition, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist stockholders.\nCampaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase stockholder value through various corporate actions. In the past, we have added to our board of directors members affiliated with two of our major stockholders, PL Capital Advisors LLC (PL Capital) and Patriot Financial Partners.\nHowever, we may have disagreements with activist stockholders which could prove disruptive to our operations. Activist stockholders could seek to elect their own candidates to our board of directors or could take other actions intended to challenge our business strategy and corporate governance. Responding to actions by activist stockholders may adversely affect our profitability or business prospects, by diverting the attention of management and our employees from executing our strategic plan. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction or strategy arising from activist stockholder initiatives could also cause increased reputational, operational, financial, regulatory and other risks, harm our ability to raise new capital, or adversely affect the market price or increase the volatility of our securities.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares. Some short sellers may seek to drive down the price of shares they have sold short by disseminating negative reports about the issuers of such shares.\nDuring late 2016, we became aware of certain allegations posted anonymously in various financial blog posts. The authors of the blog posts have typically disclosed that they hold a short position in our stock. Following the blog posting in late 2016, the market price of our common stock initially dropped significantly. While the price of our common stock subsequently increased, any additional postings and other negative publicity that have previously led to intense public scrutiny, may cause further volatility in our stock price and a decline in the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment in us.\nWhen the market price of a company's stock drops significantly, as ours did initially following the posting of the first blog, it is not unusual for stockholder lawsuits to be filed or threatened against the company and its board of directors and for a company to suffer reputational damage. Multiple lawsuits were in fact threatened and filed against us shortly following the posting of the first blog, and as discussed under Item 3 of this report, the first of several putative class lawsuits against us was filed on January 23, 2017. These lawsuits, and any other lawsuits, have caused us to incur substantial costs and diverted the time and attention of our board and management, and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, reputational damage to us may affect our ability to attract and retain deposits and may cause our deposit costs to increase, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings. Reputational damage may also affect our ability to attract and retain loan clients and maintain and develop other business relationships, which could likewise adversely affect our earnings. Continued negative reports issued by short sellers could also negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees.", "PERMNO": 89482, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BANC"}
