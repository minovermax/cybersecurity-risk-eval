{"cik": "33769", "company": "BOB EVANS FARMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients could cause consumers to avoid our products.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled or become contaminated, we may need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are harmed.\nSelling food products involves a number of legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the raw materials used to make certain of our products are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring pathogens, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and salmonella. We may need to recall some or all of our products if they become adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain. A recall could result in destruction of product inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies. Should consumption of any product cause illness or injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims (whether or not valid) that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Any of these events, including a significant product liability claim against us, could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products. Although we have various insurance programs in place to protect us against matters such as these, any of these events and/or a loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur product categories face a high level of competition, which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nThe food products business is highly competitive. Numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, trade promotion, consumer promotion, customer service, and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with a significant number of companies, many of which have multiple product lines and substantially greater financial and other resources available to them. Because of their diversity, larger capitalization and greater resources, these companies may be better able to compete on the basis of input costs or selling price.\nPrice increases for our products that we manufacture may negatively impact our financial results if not properly implemented or accepted by our customers. Future price increases, such as those made in order to offset increased input costs, may reduce our overall sales volume, which could reduce our revenue and operating profit. In addition, because we offer moderately priced food products, we may be unable to pass along price increases to our customers sufficient to completely offset cost increases. Conversely, if market prices for certain inputs decline significantly, competitive pressure could cause us to reduce the prices for our products and thereby lower our revenue and operating profit.\nIn addition, we are subject to competition from companies, including some of our customers, that either currently manufacture or are developing products directly in competition with our products. These generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than our products, making it more difficult to sell our products that compete with them. Additionally, our customers may reduce their purchases of our products or detrimentally change the shelf placement of our products in favor of their own private-label products. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting\nor promotional campaigns, each of which could materially and adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.\nTo generate revenue and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes and ingredients. In addition, changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, or changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns. Any of these changes may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products and negatively impact our financial results.\nIf we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales may decline. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. Our continued success is dependent on product innovation, including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products, and the effectiveness of advertising and promotional campaigns, marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal, there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products, or to effectively execute advertising and promotional campaigns and marketing programs. If we are unable to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins.\nIf we lose one or more of our major customers, or if any of our major customers experiences significant business interruption or enacts initiatives to improve their cost structure, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur two largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Co., accounted for approximately 20% and 14%, respectively, of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2017. If, for any reason, one of our key customers were to purchase significantly less of our products in the future or were to terminate entirely its purchases from us, or if we were unable to maintain existing relationships with key customers on terms favorable to us, our business, financial condition and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMany of our customer relationships do not require our customers to commit to any specified minimum purchase volumes. Moreover, many of our customer relationships are terminable at will by our customers following brief notice periods. As a result, we could have periods during which we have diminished orders for our products but incur costs in the short term associated with our workforce and operations that are not supportable by reduced sales volumes. In addition, our large customers may choose to purchase products from us based on a combination of factors such as price, consumer demand, customer service performance, their desired inventory levels, and other factors. Changes in any of our major customers\u2019 strategies, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, initiatives to improve their cost structure, or a shift of shelf space to private label products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find new customers in a timely fashion and on favorable terms, or at all, to supplement periods of diminished order volume from established customers. Periods of no or limited orders for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nCustomer consolidation, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may in-turn put pressure on our operating margins and profitability.\nA number of our customers, such as supermarkets and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories; resisting price increases; demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products; and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products. The economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like e-commerce, and our customers' responses to those changes could impact our business. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe price and availability of operating resources, and for commodities such as food, ingredients, and utilities, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur business depends heavily on raw materials, such as sows, potatoes and dairy products that are used in the production of our products. Our raw materials are generally sourced from third-party suppliers, and we are not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. In addition, a substantial portion of our raw materials are agricultural products, which are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frost, earthquakes, and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters also can lower crop yields and reduce supplies of these ingredients or increase their prices. Additionally, the increased global demand for corn, wheat and dairy products has increased feed costs for livestock from time to time. Also, the cost of commodities subject to governmental regulation, such as dairy and corn, can be even more susceptible to price fluctuation than other products. Some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change may result in more severe, volatile weather, which could result in greater volatility in product supply and price. Furthermore, many of the products that we use and their costs are interrelated, which could result in compound effects from events that negatively affect our sources of supply. Other events that adversely affect our third-party suppliers and that are out of our control could also impair our ability to obtain the raw materials and other inputs that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers' businesses, finances, labor relations, costs, production, insurance, and reputation.\nSows are the most important raw material used to produce our pork sausage products. We procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in many states and Canada. The live sow market is volatile in terms of the number of sows available and the current market price. The live sow market is dependent upon supply and demand for pork products, as well as such commodities as corn and soybean meal prices (the major food supply for sows), weather and farmers\u2019 access to capital. We also use pork trimmings in certain of our products. The pork trimmings market is also volatile in terms of availability and market price. Higher sow and pork trimmings costs could adversely affect our profitability, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along any portion of the increased costs to our consumers in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond effectively to one or more adverse changes in any of these operating costs could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, because we offer moderately priced food products, we may be unable to pass along price increases to our customers sufficient to completely offset cost increases.\nWe are vulnerable to disruptions to our food processing business because our food production business is concentrated in five manufacturing facilities.\nBecause the majority of our food products are produced in five manufacturing facilities, significant disruptions at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We produce fresh sausage products at our plants located in Hillsdale, Michigan and Xenia, Ohio. Ready-to-eat products, such as sandwiches, soups and gravies, are produced at our Sulphur Springs, Texas plant. Our Lima, Ohio, plant and the PFPC facility we recently acquired in Mars Hill, Maine produce refrigerated side-dishes as well as diced and shredded potatoes. If we had to close or limit production of all or part of the operations at one or more of these plants for an extended period of time, we may be unable to increase production at our other plants or with our third-party co-packers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on third party co-packers for a portion of our manufacturing capacity needs, and the inability to enter into additional or future co-packing agreements could limit our ability to meet customer demand.\nWe rely upon co-packers for a portion of our manufacturing needs. The success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform. We believe that there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-packers in the industry, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative co-packing agreements or arrangements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner.\nWe outsource certain business processes and product manufacturing to third-party vendors that subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nSome of our business processes and the manufacturing of certain products are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include distribution of food and retail products to our food service customers, employee payroll card services, health care and workers\u2019 compensation claims processing, wage and related tax credit documentation and approval and externally hosted business software applications. We cannot ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities, and there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on certain technology licensed from third parties and may be required to license additional technology in the future for use in managing our Internet sites and providing services to our customers and employees. These third-party\ntechnology licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain these technology licenses could adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the failure to execute and successfully integrate business acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to identify and complete acquisitions in the future, and our failure to do so could limit our ability to grow our business beyond our existing products. Additionally, the process of integrating any acquired business involves risks. For example, if we are unable to successfully integrate the recently completed acquisition of PFPC with our existing food production business in an efficient and effective manner, the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of PFPC, including the expected diversification and expansion of our production capability and transportation cost savings, may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of PFPC, or any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the Company. In addition, the actual integration of PFPC may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nMoreover, if we pursue strategic acquisitions or joint ventures in the future, we may incur significant costs and may not be able to consummate the transactions or obtain the requisite financing. Potential risks of acquisitions, in addition to the integration risks discussed above, include: the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses; potential assumption of unknown liabilities; the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we may have limited or no prior experience.\nThe divestiture of the Restaurants Business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn April 2017, we completed the sale of our Restaurants Business to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC (formerly, BER Acquisition, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the \u201cBuyer\u201d), pursuant to an Asset and Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \u201cBER Sale Agreement\u201d) between the Company and the Buyer dated January 24, 2017. Difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel could have an adverse impact on operations of the Company.\nAs part of the sale of the Restaurants Business the Company also entered into a transition services agreement (\"TSA\"), pursuant to which both the Company and the Buyer will provide transition services to the other party at the provider\u2019s cost for a period of 18 months following the closing. Disruptions in the services provided under the TSA, including the IT services the Company will provide the Restaurants Business, could have an adverse impact on our on-going business, as well as the Restaurants Business, which remains a significant customer of the Company. The obligation to indemnify the Buyer for certain breaches of the BER Sale Agreement and for certain other liabilities, subject to the applicable limitations in the BER Sale Agreement, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. The Company may also be negatively impacted by the departure of senior members of our corporate management team in connection with the transaction, as well as an increased potential for losses of further employees as a result of the uncertainty created by the transaction.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in managing these risks or that these risks will not adversely affect our results of operations.\nGuarantor provisions associated with restaurant lease obligations could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition even after completion of the sale.\nFollowing the sale of our Restaurants Business, the Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Restaurants Business. However, as part of the sale leaseback transaction of 143 of our restaurant properties in fiscal 2016, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary BEF Foods, Inc. entered into payment and performance guaranties relating to the leases on such restaurant properties, which have remained in place following the completion of the sale of our Restaurants Business. Under the terms of the BER Sale Agreement, the Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on these sale leaseback properties. However, while we will no longer have control over the Restaurants Business, under the terms of the guaranties we remain liable for payments due under these leases if the Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the payment and performance guaranties could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nA material disruption in our information technology, network infrastructure and telecommunication systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are a highly automated business and rely on our production facilities, our network infrastructure, the Internet, our website and mobile apps for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. Our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems to process these transactions, summarize results and manage and report on our business and our supply chain. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, infiltration, damage, interruption or failure from power outages, computer, network, cable system, Internet and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism or usage errors by our employees. If our information technology and telecommunication systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we could suffer loss of critical data, system interruption, delay, limitations on operations and services and disruption in our product production. Any material interruption in our information technology and telecommunication systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nMany of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for operations are centralized at one Ohio location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of digital and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, experience inability to perform vital corporate functions, experience delays in required reporting and compliance, fail to adequately support field operations and experience other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures. These could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nA privacy breach could adversely affect our business.\nThe protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy and fraud. Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our cyber environment to reduce the likelihood of any security incident. We have developed a multi-disciplined security incident response plan to help ensure that our executives are fully and accurately informed and managing, with the help of content experts, the discovery, investigation, auditing and recovery stages of any security incidents. However, we can provide no assurance that our security measures will be successful in the event of an attempted or actual security incident. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes.\nIn addition, our customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this confidential information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations regarding privacy and security or experience a security breach, we could be exposed to risks of data loss, fines, litigation, termination or diminution of our relationships with affected customers and serious disruption of our operations. Additionally, any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of our rights in trademarks, trade dress, copyrights and other intellectual property rights that we use in our business. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or our use of intellectual property infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement against us could prevent us from providing our products, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a breakdown in our internal policies and procedures may lead to an unintentional disclosure of our proprietary, confidential or material non-public information, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in connection with the Restaurants Business transaction, many of the trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights that we use in our business were contributed to the IPCo. As a result of this contribution, the IPCo is the legal owner of these intellectual property assets, and we hold the right to use these intellectual property assets through license agreements with the IPCo. As such, any enforcement action with respect to certain intellectual property rights we use in our business may require the active involvement or approval of the IPCo, over which we do not have sole control. If we are prevented from, or otherwise unable to, protect intellectual property rights we use in our business, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, because certain of our tradenames are shared and used by a third party, negative events outside of our control, for example a privacy breach or food safety issue at Bob Evans Restaurants, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe loss of key executives or difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could jeopardize our future growth and success.\nWe have assembled a senior management team that has substantial background and experience in the food products industry. Our future growth and success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. If we fail to retain senior management or other key personnel or fail to attract key personnel, our succession planning and operations could be materially and adversely affected and could jeopardize our ability to meet our business goals.\nLabor organizing could harm our operations and competitive position in our industry, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur staff members and others may attempt to unionize our workforce, establish boycotts or picket lines or interrupt our supply chains which could limit our ability to manage our workforce effectively and cause disruptions to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. A loss of our ability to effectively manage our workforce and the compensation and benefits we offer to our employees could significantly increase our labor costs, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur marketing and branding strategies may not be successful, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur marketing and branding strategies continue to evolve to maximize our appeal to customers and compete effectively. We do not have any assurance that our marketing strategies will be successful. Moreover, many of our competitors have successfully used national marketing strategies in the past, including network, cable television, and social media and we may not be able to successfully compete against those established and newly developed programs.\nMedia campaigns related to food production and the use or misuse of social media may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nMedia outlets, including new social media platforms, provide the opportunity for individuals or organizations to publicize inappropriate or inaccurate stories or perceptions about us or the food industry. Such practices have the ability to cause damage to our brands, the industry generally, or consumers\u2019 perceptions of us or the food production industry and may result in negative publicity and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to make and advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment, it could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur sales and profit growth is dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets.\nSuccessful growth depends in part on our ability to add new retail customers, as well as expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers. This would include expanding the number of our items they offer for sale and product placement within the refrigerated meat and side-dish departments. The expansion of our business depends on our ability to obtain and retain large-account customers, such as grocery store chains and warehouse customers. Our failure to retain and obtain new large-account customers or maintain our relationships with existing large-account customers could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase less of our products and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of our products. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur current insurance programs expose us to unexpected costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage is structured to include deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability, stop loss limits and similar provisions that we believe prudent based on our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure or where the risk is considered low, such as losses due to acts of terrorism and some natural disasters, including floods. If we incur such losses, our business could suffer. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, including unexpected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting either in volatility or a decline in the price of our securities.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of any number of factors in or outside of our control. Our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any fiscal year. If our annual or quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to the factors discussed above, this could result in the price of our securities fluctuating dramatically over time or could decrease generally.\nOur actual operating and financial results in any given period may differ from guidance we provide to the public, including our most recent public guidance.\nFrom time to time, in press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls and other contexts, we have provided guidance to the public regarding current business conditions and our expectations for our future financial results. We expect that we will provide guidance periodically in the future. Our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions, expectations and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In providing our guidance, we also make various assumptions with respect to our future business decisions, some of which will change. Our actual financial results, therefore, may vary from our guidance due to our inability to meet the assumptions upon which our guidance is based and the impact on our business of the various risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors and in our public filings with the SEC. Variances between our actual results and our guidance may be material. To the extent that our actual financial results do not meet or exceed our guidance, the trading prices of our\nsecurities may be materially adversely affected, and we may suffer associated costs related to the matter, such as legal costs associated with any claims.\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading price of our stock.\nA number of factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock. These include, but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst expectations; changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in our industry; announcements of significant transactions (including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in our industry; and actions by activist shareholders. In addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual company\u2019s operating performance. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our company and industry, as well as factors related to the equity markets overall.\nIn addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our common stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders, as well as non-operating initiatives such as share repurchase programs. Any failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance, particularly with respect to revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nOur dividend program, as well as stock repurchase program (if any), requires the use of a substantial amount of our free cash flow. Assuming the authorization of either program by our Board of Directors, our ability to pay dividends over time, or repurchase stock from time to time, will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and capacity to borrow funds, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure to pay our dividends over time may negatively impact investor confidence in us, and may negatively impact our stock price.\nNew laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe food industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to food safety, food labeling, and environmental matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, international trade, immigration, and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Also, the failure to obtain and maintain required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability. In addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience, and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealth Reform Law\u201d) serves as the primary vehicle for comprehensive healthcare reform in the United States. Among other things, the Health Reform Law contains provisions that affect employer-sponsored health plans and impose excise and other taxes and fees with respect to certain plans. We anticipate increased expenses relating to our and our company-sponsored plans over the course of the next several years. If we are not able to limit or offset future cost increases, those costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The 2016 U.S. elections, which resulted in the election of a Republican president and Republican control of both houses of Congress, may lead to the repeal of the Health Reform Law or significant changes to the Health Reform Law, its implementation or its interpretation. We are unable to predict whether, when, and how the Health Reform Law will be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions, or the impact of alternative provisions on our results of operations.\nLitigation, legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and damage our reputation.\nWe are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, such as employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wage and hour disputes or wrongful termination. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that management\u2019s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings. In the event that management\u2019s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate, or litigation that is material arises in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings (even if untrue) may also adversely affect our reputation. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or damage our reputation.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may discourage potential acquirers of the Company.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company. This includes Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (as defined in the statute) for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met. These provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our current directors and executive officers a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition, or other significant corporate transaction, was considered beneficial by some of our shareholders. If a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our securities could decline.", "PERMNO": 18570, "SIC": 2013, "TIC": "BOBE"}
