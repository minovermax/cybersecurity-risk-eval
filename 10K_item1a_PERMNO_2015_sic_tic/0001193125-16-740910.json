{"cik": "836157", "company": "LINDSAY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following are certain of the more significant risks that may affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s irrigation revenues are highly dependent on the agricultural industry and weather conditions. The Company\u2019s irrigation revenues are cyclical and highly dependent upon the need for irrigated agricultural crop production which, in turn, depends upon many factors, including total worldwide crop production, the profitability of agricultural crop production, agricultural commodity prices, net farm income, availability of financing for farmers, governmental policies regarding the agricultural sector, water and energy conservation policies, the regularity of rainfall and regional climate change. As farm income decreases, farmers may postpone capital expenditures or seek less expensive irrigation alternatives.\nWeather conditions, particularly leading up to the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of consumers of irrigation equipment. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, and droughts can have significant effects on seasonal irrigation demand. Drought conditions, which generally affect irrigation equipment demand positively over the long term, can adversely affect demand if water sources become unavailable or if governments impose water restriction policies to reduce overall water availability.\nChanging worldwide demand for food and different types of biofuel could have an effect on the price of agricultural commodities and consequently the demand for irrigation equipment. Changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world\u2019s growing food and biofuel demands, driven in part by government policies and an expanding global population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which affect demand for irrigation equipment. The primary benefit of many of the Company\u2019s irrigation products is to increase grain yields and the resulting revenue for farmers. As grain prices decline, the breakeven point of incremental production is more difficult to achieve, reducing or eliminating the profit and return on investment from the purchase of the Company\u2019s products. As a result, changes in grain prices can significantly affect the Company\u2019s sales levels in the U.S. and international markets.\nA decline in oil prices or changes in government policies regarding biofuels could also negatively affect the biofuels market and/or reduce government revenues of oil-producing countries that purchase or subsidize the purchase of irrigation equipment. Biofuels production is a significant source of grain demand in the U.S. and certain international markets. While ethanol production levels are currently mandated within the U.S., potential mandate changes or price declines for ethanol could reduce the demand for grains. In addition, a number of ethanol producers in the U.S. are cooperatives partially owned by farmers. Reduced profit of ethanol production could reduce income for farmers which could, in turn, reduce the demand for irrigation equipment.\nThe Company\u2019s international sales are highly dependent on foreign market conditions and subject the Company to additional risk, restrictions, and compliance obligations. International revenues are primarily generated from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central and Western Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, Africa, China, Russia, Ukraine, and Central and South America. In addition to risks relating to general economic and potential instability in these countries, a number of countries are particularly susceptible to disruption from changing socioeconomic conditions as well as terrorism, sanctions, war and similar incidents. The collectability of receivables can also be difficult to estimate, particularly in areas of political instability or with governments with which the Company has limited experience or where there is a lack of transparency as to the current credit condition.\nThe Company\u2019s international sales efforts and profit margins are affected by international trade barriers, including governmental policies on tariffs, taxes, import or export licensing requirements and trade sanctions. For example, the Company could receive penalties or even be ordered to cease certain sales activities in the event that the Company makes sales in a sanctioned country in a manner that is not in compliance with authorizations or licenses granted to the Company or its affiliates by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nThe Company\u2019s international sales efforts must also comply with anti-corruption laws like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries (including, in the Company\u2019s case, dealers and sales representatives) from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or certain private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage. As part of the Company\u2019s irrigation and infrastructure sales efforts, the Company deals with and sells solutions to government entities and state-owned or state-backed business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered government officials for purposes of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, some of the countries in which the Company does business lack fully developed legal systems and are perceived to have elevated levels of corruption. Although the Company has compliance and training programs in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws, violations of these laws or other compliance requirements could occur and result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s international sales and profit margins are subject to currency exchange risk. Most of the Company\u2019s international sales involve some level of export from the U.S., either of components or completed products. Policies and geopolitical events affecting exchange rates could adversely affect the international flow of agricultural and other commodities, which can cause a corresponding downturn in the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of the world. Further, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar or any other currency of a country in which the Company manufactures its products (e.g., Brazilian real, South African rand, Turkish lira) and/or any weakening of local currencies can increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products in its foreign markets. Irrespective of any effect on the overall demand for agricultural equipment, the effect of these changes can make the Company\u2019s products less competitive relative to local producing competitors and, in extreme cases, can result in the Company\u2019s products not being cost-effective for customers. As a result, the Company\u2019s international sales and profit margins could decline.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively affected by changes in the availability and price of certain parts, components, and raw materials. The Company requires access to various parts, components, and raw materials at competitive prices in order to manufacture its products. Changes in the availability and price of these parts, components, and raw materials (including steel and zinc), which have changed significantly and rapidly at times and are affected by factors like demand and freight costs, can significantly increase the costs of production. Due to price competition in the market for irrigation equipment and certain infrastructure products, the Company may not be able to recoup increases in these costs through price increases for its products, which would result in reduced profitability. Whether increased operating costs can be passed through to the customer depends on a number of factors, including farm income and the price of competing products. Further, the Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, parts and components in the manufacturing process. Disruptions or delays in supply or significant price increases from these suppliers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and profitability. Such disruptions, terminations or cost increases could result in cost inefficiencies, delayed sales or reduced sales.\nThe Company\u2019s infrastructure revenues are highly dependent on government funding of transportation projects and subject to compliance with government regulations. The demand for the Company\u2019s infrastructure products depends to a large degree on the amount of government spending authorized to improve road and highway systems. For example, the U.S. government funds highway and road improvements through the Federal Highway Trust Fund Program and matching funding from states may be required as a condition of federal funding. If highway funding is reduced or delayed, it may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s infrastructure products.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s road safety products are required to meet certain standards as outlined by the various governments worldwide. The Federal Highway Administration (\u201cFHWA\u201d) has begun to implement updated Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (\u201cMASH\u201d) standards. In addition, state departments of transportation have the ability to require compliance with MASH standards prior to FHWA mandating such practices. MASH was previously optional and most road safety products in the market have not been approved under these\nstandards. The Company is incurring, and will continue to incur, research and development and testing expense to comply with these standards. The implementation of the new standards and/or any delay in the Company\u2019s development of infrastructure products that comply with the new standards could affect the Company\u2019s competitive position in the market which could have a significant effect on the sales and profitability from its road safety product line.\nCompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety regulations or standards may require additional capital and operational expenditures. The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations which govern environmental and occupational health and safety matters. The Company believes that its operations are substantially in compliance with all such applicable laws and regulations and that it holds all necessary permits in each jurisdiction in which its facilities are located. Environmental and health and safety regulations are subject to change and interpretation. Compliance with applicable regulations or standards may require the Company to make additional capital and operational expenditures.\nThe Company\u2019s Lindsay, Nebraska site was added to the list of priority superfund sites of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) in 1989. The Company and its environmental consultants have developed a remedial alternative work plan, under which the Company continues to work with the EPA to define and implement steps to better contain and remediate the remaining contamination. Although the Company has accrued reasonably estimable costs associated with remediation of the site, the estimate of costs and their timing could change as a result of a number of factors, including (1) input from the EPA and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (the \u201cNDEQ\u201d) on the proposed remediation plan and any changes which they may subsequently require, (2) refinement of cost estimates and length of time required to complete remediation and post-remediation operations and maintenance, (3) effectiveness of the technology chosen in remediation of the site as well as changes in technology that may be available in the future, and (4) unforeseen circumstances existing at the site. As a result of these factors, the actual amount of costs incurred by the Company in connection with the remediation of contamination of its Lindsay, Nebraska site could exceed the amounts accrued for this expense at this time. The Company\u2019s ongoing remediation activities at its Lindsay, Nebraska facility are described in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company is exposed to risks from legal proceedings. From time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal proceedings and other various claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business, which may include commercial, employment, product liability, tort, and other litigation. Current and future litigation, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits, indemnification claims or other claims that the Company faces may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of its management regardless of the outcome. In addition, these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of its normal business operations. Litigation, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits, indemnification claims or other claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk. The nature of the Company\u2019s business subjects the Company to potential liability for claims alleging property damage and personal injury or death arising from the use of or exposure to its products, especially infrastructure products that are installed along roadways. While the Company\u2019s liability insurance coverage is consistent with commercial norms in the industries in which the Company operates, an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims could potentially exceed the Company\u2019s available insurance coverage. In addition, the availability of, and the Company\u2019s ability to collect on, insurance coverage can be subject to factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. For example, any accident, incident, or lawsuit involving other companies operating in the infrastructure market could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance to the Company in the future, even if the Company is not involved in any such accident, incident, or lawsuit. If any of the Company\u2019s third-party insurers fail, cancel, or refuse coverage, or otherwise are unable to provide the Company with adequate insurance coverage, then the Company\u2019s overall risk exposure and operational expenses would increase and the management of the Company\u2019s business operations would be disrupted.\nFurther, as insurance policies expire, increased premiums for renewed or new coverage may increase the Company\u2019s insurance expense and/or require that the Company increase its self-insured retention or deductibles. The Company maintains primary coverage and excess coverage policies. If the number of claims or the dollar amounts of any such claims rise in any policy year, the Company could suffer additional costs associated with accessing its excess coverage policies. Also, an increase in the loss amounts attributable to such claims could expose the Company to uninsured damages if the Company was unable or elected not to insure against certain claims because of increased premiums or other reasons.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products. Interest rates globally remain at historically low levels. In some international markets, the Company has begun to see these rates rise and it is expected that global rates will continue to increase, potentially quickly in the U.S., as the economy improves. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and customers\u2019 ability to repay obligations to the Company. An increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult for customers to cost-effectively fund the purchase of new equipment, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency translation risk. The reporting currency for the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s results.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with its operations and could compromise the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 information, exposing the Company to liability that could cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business functions, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. The Company uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the Company\u2019s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 12211, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "LNN"}
