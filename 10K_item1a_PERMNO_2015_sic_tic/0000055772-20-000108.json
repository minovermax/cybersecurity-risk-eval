{"cik": "55772", "company": "KIMBALL INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following important risk factors could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be carefully considered before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about, we currently believe are immaterial or we have not predicted may also affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by various governments and third parties to combat the spread of COVID-19 (including, in\nsome cases, mandatory quarantines and other suspensions of non-essential business operations) have led to significant disruptions in our manufacturing and distribution operations and could also disrupt our supply chains, including temporary reductions or pauses in operations at many of our and our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing and distribution locations around the world. New order rates have also slowed in all three markets. We expect that our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted while the impact of COVID-19 continues. Our dealers and suppliers are also experiencing similar negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to preserve cash during this period of time, we have reduced spending on discretionary expenditures, which may have a material impact on our growth in the future.\nThe economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, or are likely to have, a negative impact on many of our customers, particularly those in the hospitality market and, thus, may negatively affect our future revenues and increase credit risk. The severity of the impact on our business will depend in part on the delay of plans to return to the workplace balanced with working from home, prolonged reduction in travel, and the speed of the recovery of economic conditions globally, all of which are highly uncertain and out of our control. The duration and severity of the impact on our business, our industry and the global economy are not yet known and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and managing our Kimball International Connect Strategies. In May 2019, we introduced our comprehensive Kimball International Connect strategy that is intended to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth. In August 2020, we announced the continuation of our strategy that we call Connect 2.0 which centers around accelerating our growth. Our plan is designed to enable us to effectively manage through the current economic downturn, by driving market share gains for the Company and yielding additional cost savings. The execution of these strategies involves risk, as management\u2019s focus and Company resources could be diverted from our core operations, growth in our business could lead to operating inefficiencies, our corporate culture could be disrupted, which could lead to employee attrition, and our revenues could fall or could fail to grow as intended, any of which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur restructuring efforts may not be successful. In June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. A critical component of our transformation restructuring plan is the transfer of production among facilities, which may result in management\u2019s focus being diverted from our core operations, manufacturing inefficiencies, and excess working capital during the transition period. We also created center-led functions for finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions and centralized our supply chain efforts. The transition to center-led functions involves risk, as management\u2019s focus could be diverted from our core operations. In addition, Kimball brand selling resources are being reallocated to higher-growth markets, and we exited four furniture showrooms during fiscal year 2020, which could cause a temporary or permanent decline if revenues are not realized in the higher-growth markets. If our closed leased facilities are not able to be subleased in the future according to our assumptions, we may incur additional impairment charges through restructuring expense.\nThe second phase of our transformation restructuring plan was announced in August 2020 that will align the Company\u2019s business units to a new market-centric orientation. The Company will streamline manufacturing facilities by leveraging production capabilities across all facilities, establishing centers of excellence, and setting up processes to facilitate flexing of product between facilities in response to volume fluctuations. The Company will be reorganized into four market centric business units which are Workplace, Health, Hospitality, and eBusiness. The Company will streamline its workforce to align with the new organizational structure and respond to lower volumes created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The successful execution of both phases of our transformation restructuring plan is also dependent on the realization of cost savings, and, even if successful, the transformation restructuring plan may not be accomplished as quickly or effectively as anticipated.\nChanges to government regulations may significantly increase our operating costs in the United States and abroad. Legislative and regulatory reforms by the U.S. federal and foreign governments could significantly impact our profitability by burdening us with forced cost choices that are difficult to recover with increased pricing. For example:\n\u2022We depend on suppliers globally to provide materials, parts, finished goods, and components for use in our products. We utilize both steel and aluminum in our products, most of which is sourced domestically. Tariffs or changes in global trade agreements or in U.S. governmental import/export regulations could cause the landed cost of our products to increase materially and could reduce our net income if we are unable to mitigate the additional cost, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022We conduct business with entities in Canada and Mexico; therefore, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), could result in increased regulation on, or otherwise impact, trade between the countries, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022We import a portion of our wooden furniture products and are thus subject to an anti-dumping tariff specifically on wooden bedroom furniture supplied from China. The tariffs are subject to review and could result in retroactive and\nprospective tariff rate increases, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022State and foreign regulations are increasing in many areas, such as hazardous waste disposal, labor relations, employment practices and data privacy, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, among others. Compliance with privacy regulations requires us to change our processes in order to track personal information collected from consumers and implement procedures to obtain consent from consumers regarding the usage of their information. These additional processes, or any violations of these state and foreign regulations, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components for use in our products at a competitive price, in a timely manner, or at all. We depend on suppliers globally to provide timely delivery of materials, parts, and components for use in our products. We monitor the financial stability of suppliers when feasible, as the loss of a significant supplier could have an adverse impact on our operations. Certain finished products and components we purchase are primarily manufactured in select regions of the world, and issues in those regions could cause manufacturing delays. In addition, delays can occur related to the transport of products and components via container ships, which load and unload through various U.S. ports that sometimes experience congestion. Price increases of commodity components could have an adverse impact on our profitability if we cannot offset such increases with other cost reductions or by price increases to customers. New tariffs or trade regulations which have been and could be imposed by the U.S. federal government may adversely impact our access, price, and delivery of finished products and components from foreign sources, and therefore adversely affect our profitability. Materials we utilize are generally available, but future availability is unknown and could impact our ability to meet customer order requirements. If suppliers fail to meet commitments to us in terms of price, delivery, or quality, it could interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.\nUncertain macroeconomic and industry conditions, or a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets, could adversely impact demand for our products and adversely affect operating results. Market demand for our products, which impacts revenues and gross profit, is influenced by a variety of economic and industry factors such as:\n\u2022global consumer confidence;\n\u2022volatility and the cyclical nature of worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022increased working from home;\n\u2022weakness in the global financial markets;\n\u2022general corporate profitability of the end markets to which we sell;\n\u2022credit availability to the end markets to which we sell;\n\u2022service-sector unemployment rates;\n\u2022commercial property vacancy rates;\n\u2022non-residential construction and refurbishment rates;\n\u2022deficit status of many governmental entities which may result in declining purchases of office furniture;\n\u2022uncertainty surrounding potential reform of the Affordable Care Act;\n\u2022COVID-19 impacts; and\n\u2022new hotel and casino construction and refurbishment rates.\nWe must make decisions based on order volumes in order to achieve manufacturing efficiency. These decisions include determining what level of additional business to accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, and personnel requirements, among various other considerations. We must constantly monitor the changing economic landscape and may modify our strategic direction accordingly. If we do not react quickly enough to the changes in market or economic conditions, it could result in lost customers, decreased market share, and increased operating costs.\nWe are subject to manufacturing inefficiencies due to the transfer of production among our facilities and other factors. At times we may experience labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to factors such as new product introductions, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, a sudden decline in sales such as due to COVID-19, a new operating system, or turnover in personnel. Manufacturing inefficiencies could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nA shortage of freight carrier capacity could drive increases in freight costs. We outsource inbound and outbound shipping to third-party contract carriers, including a dedicated freight provider that operates transportation equipment with our Company branding, and other domestic and international contract carriers. We may experience pressure on freight costs if our demand exceeds the capacity of available trucking and ocean fleets, particularly for commercial contract carriers. In periods of tight capacity, we may be unable to mitigate a freight cost increase through our supply chain planning or by increasing prices on our products, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, mainly in the United States. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. Future events could change management\u2019s assessment. We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We have also made assumptions about the realization of deferred tax assets. Changes in these assumptions could result in a valuation allowance for these assets. Final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is currently reflected by our income tax provisions and accruals, which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur failure to retain our existing management team, maintain our engineering, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our business. We depend significantly on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities that meet customers\u2019 changing needs. To do that, we must retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuous training, motivation, and development of employees, and we strive to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. Failure to retain our executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nTurnover in personnel could cause manufacturing inefficiencies. The demand for manufacturing labor in certain geographic areas makes retaining experienced production employees difficult. Turnover could result in lost time due to inefficiencies and the need for additional training, which could impact our operating results.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements, and noncompliance could expose us to liability or impede current or future business. The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either at their discretion or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract, which could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders. The failure to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements could subject us to investigations, fines, or other penalties, and violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions that present risks and may not be successful. Our sales growth plans may occur through both organic growth and acquisitions. Acquisitions involve many risks that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including:\n\u2022difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and in negotiating and consummating acquisitions on terms attractive to us;\n\u2022difficulties in the assimilation of the operations of the acquired company;\n\u2022the diversion of resources, including diverting management\u2019s attention from our current operations;\n\u2022risks of entering new geographic or product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022the potential loss of key customers, suppliers and employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022the potential incurrence of indebtedness to fund the acquisition;\n\u2022the potential issuance of common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute ownership interests of our current shareholders;\n\u2022the acquired business not achieving anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flow, or market share;\n\u2022excess capacity;\n\u2022failure to achieve the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our financial results; and\n\u2022dilution of earnings.\nWe may not be successful in launching start-up operations or expanding our business in digital marketplaces. We are committed to growing our business, and therefore from time to time, we may determine that it would be in our best interests to start up a new operation or establish a digital presence to sell certain products, including via our planned eBusiness unit. Start-up operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties, such as funding the capital expenditures related to the start-up operation, developing a management team for the new operation, diversion of management focus away from current operations, and creation of excess capacity. The risks and uncertainties that come with a digital presence include competition from more established competitors in the marketplace, responding quickly to consumer traffic patterns, supporting demand outside our\ncurrent distribution channels, and additional cybersecurity risks. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business depends on information technology systems and digital capabilities that are implemented in a manner intended to minimize the risk of a cybersecurity breach or other such threat, including the misappropriation of assets or other sensitive information or data corruption, which could cause operational disruption. An ongoing commitment of significant resources is required to maintain and enhance our existing information systems and implement the new and emerging technology necessary to meet customer expectations and compete in our markets. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and are not often recognized until after they have been launched. We recognize that any breach could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, erode our share value, drive remediation expenses, or increase costs related to the mitigation of, response to, or litigation arising from any such issue. We cannot guarantee that our cybersecurity measures will completely prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our enterprise network, system and data.\nMany states and the U.S. federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft and to also protect their privacy. As our business expands globally, we are subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various foreign jurisdictions. If we are the target of a cybersecurity attack resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, we may be required to execute costly notification procedures. Compliance with these laws will likely increase the costs of doing business. If we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to the credit risk of our customers who are adversely affected by weakness in market conditions. Weakness in market conditions, including that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may drive an elevated risk of potential bankruptcy of our customers resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible outstanding accounts receivable. The realization of these risks could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nReduction of purchases by or the loss of a significant number of customers could reduce revenues and profitability. Significant declines in the level of purchases by customers or the loss of a significant number of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. A reduction of, or uncertainty surrounding, government spending could also have an adverse impact on our sales levels. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully replace any lost sales, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully. The office and hospitality furniture industries are competitive due to numerous global manufacturers competing in the marketplace. In times of reduced demand for office furniture, large competitors may have greater efficiencies of scale or may apply more pressure to their aligned distribution to sell their products exclusively, which could lead to reduced opportunities for our products. While we work toward reducing costs to respond to pricing pressures, if we cannot achieve proportionate reductions in costs, profit margins may suffer.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of fuel and other energy sources. The cost of energy is a critical component of freight expense and the cost of operating manufacturing facilities. Increases in the cost of energy could reduce our profitability.\nA change in our sales mix among our diversified product offerings could have a negative impact on our gross profit margin. Changes in product sales mix could negatively impact our gross margin, as margins of different products vary. We strive to improve the margins of all products, but certain products have lower margins in order to price the product competitively. An increase in the proportion of sales of products with lower margins could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur international operations involve financial and operational risks. We have a manufacturing operation outside the United States in Mexico, and administrative offices in China and Vietnam that coordinate with suppliers in those countries. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022economic and political instability;\n\u2022various and potentially conflicting cultural norms and business practices;\n\u2022warfare, riots, terrorism, and other forms of violence or geopolitical disruption;\n\u2022compliance with laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to U.S. companies doing business outside the United States;\n\u2022changes in foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022health and security issues;\n\u2022tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the manner in which multinational companies are taxed in the U.S.;\n\u2022COVID-19 impacts; and\n\u2022foreign labor practices.\nThese risks could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in exchange rates could impact our operating results. Our risk management strategy may include the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. Any hedging techniques we implement contain risks and may not be entirely effective. Exchange rate fluctuations could also make our products more expensive than a competitor's products not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets.\nIf efforts to introduce new products or start-up new programs are not successful, this could limit sales growth or cause sales to decline. We regularly introduce new products to keep pace with workplace trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, and safety standards such as sustainability and ergonomic considerations, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance. Shifts in workforce demographics, the popularity of working from home, working styles, and technology may impact the quantity and types of furniture products purchased by our customers. The introduction of new products or the start-up of new programs require the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of such products. The design and engineering required for certain new products or programs can take an extended period of time, and further time may be required to achieve customer acceptance. Accordingly, the launch of any particular product or program may be delayed or may be less successful than we originally anticipated. Difficulties or delays in introducing new products or programs, or lack of customer acceptance of new products or programs could limit sales growth or cause sales to decline.\nIf customers do not perceive our products and services to be innovative and of high quality, our brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer. We believe that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to our business. Promotion and enhancement of our name and brands will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design-driven, innovative, and high-quality products and superior services. If customers do not perceive our products and services to be design-driven, innovative, and of high quality, our reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the potential for product recalls, product liability and other claims against it which could affect its earnings and financial condition. New and existing products may be subject to the United States Consumer Products Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or comparable foreign agency could require the Company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products. Any purchase or recall of the Company\u2019s products could be costly and damaging to the Company\u2019s reputation. If the Company were required to remove, or voluntarily removed, its products from the market, the Company\u2019s reputation could be impacted and the Company may have large quantities of finished product that it could not sell. The Company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, adversely impact the value of its end-user brands, or result in an increase in the cost of producing the Company\u2019s products.\nA loss of independent sales representatives, dealers, or other sales channels could lead to a decline in sales. Our workplace and health furniture is marketed to end users through both independent and employee sales representatives, furniture dealers, wholesalers, brokers, designers, purchasing companies, catalog houses, and eCommerce services. Our hospitality furniture is marketed to end users using independent sales representatives. A significant loss within any of these sales channels could result in a sales decline and thus have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, closures of furniture showrooms across our brands could negatively affect our current commercial relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to effectively manage working capital may adversely affect our cash flow from operations. We closely monitor inventory and receivable efficiencies and strive to improve these measures of working capital, but customer financial difficulties, cancellation or delay of customer orders, transfers of production among our manufacturing facilities, manufacturing delays, or the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe could incur losses due to asset impairment. As business conditions change, we must continually evaluate and work toward the optimum asset base. It is possible that certain assets such as, but not limited to, facilities, equipment, lease assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets, could be impaired at some point in the future depending on changing business conditions or\ninternal reorganization plans. If our closed leased facilities are not able to be subleased in the future according to our assumptions, we may incur additional impairment charges. Goodwill and certain intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when triggering events occur. Such resulting impairment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nA failure to comply with the financial covenants under our $75.0 million credit facility could adversely impact us. Our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. We believe the most significant covenants under this credit facility are the adjusted leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. More detail on these financial covenants is discussed in Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of June 30, 2020, we had no borrowings under this credit facility and we had $1.6 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. In the future, a default on the financial covenants under our credit facility could cause an increase in our borrowing rates or could make it more difficult for us to secure future financing, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could undermine our competitive position. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party non-disclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States, and therefore in some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property. Competing effectively depends, to a significant extent, on maintaining the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. The degree of protection offered by our various patents and trademarks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company, and patents or trademarks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications. In addition, not all of our products are covered by patents. It is also possible that our patents and trademarks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their intellectual property rights and incur substantial litigation or other costs. Prior to launching major new products in our key markets, we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights. However, our competitors may have filed for patent protection that is not, at the time of our evaluation, a matter of public knowledge. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties' intellectual property rights may not be successful. We could be notified of a claim regarding intellectual property rights, which could lead us to spend time and money to defend or address the claim. Even if the claim is without merit, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nOur insurance may not adequately protect us from liabilities related to product defects. We maintain product liability and other insurance coverage that we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices, but our insurance coverage does not extend to field visits to repair, retrofit or replace defective products, or to product recalls. As a result, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial claims and costs that may arise from liabilities related to product defects, particularly if we have a large number of defective products that we must repair, retrofit, replace, or recall. Additionally, the cost of insurance for a given level of coverage may increase which may impact profitability or lead us to reduce insurance coverage levels.\nIncreases in the cost of providing employee healthcare benefits could reduce our profitability. There may continue to be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to our employees. We are self-insured for healthcare benefits, so we incur the cost of claims, including catastrophic claims that may occasionally occur, with employees bearing only a limited portion of healthcare costs through employee healthcare premium withholdings. Healthcare claims declined when COVID-19 hit as elective procedures were delayed. We expect there to be an increase in claims when employees choose to have elective procedures completed. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and significant potential environmental liabilities. Our past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing plants and real property are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. In addition, the increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist with respect to our facilities and real property. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require additional expenditures, some of which could be material. In addition, any investigations or remedial efforts relating to environmental matters could involve material costs or otherwise result in material liabilities.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may impact our production schedules and, in turn, negatively impact profitability. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, pandemics, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise our ability to produce or deliver products. Our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and oil, and governmental regulations may control the allocation of such fuels. Employees are an integral part of our business, and events such as a pandemic could reduce the availability of employees reporting for work. In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, catastrophic events, or the threat thereof, can adversely affect U.S. and world economies, and could result in delayed or lost sales of our products. In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customer orders, manufacture products, and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with our customers, potentially resulting in a reduction in orders from customers or a loss of customers. We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these matters, but such insurance may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner to us in the event of such an interruption.\nThe value of our common stock may experience substantial fluctuations for reasons over which we may have little control. The value of our common stock could fluctuate substantially based on a variety of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results;\n\u2022announcements concerning our Company, competitors, or industry;\n\u2022overall volatility of the stock market;\n\u2022changes in the financial estimates of securities analysts or investors regarding our Company, the industry, or competitors;\n\u2022general market or economic conditions including the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022proxy contests or other shareholder activism.\nWe also provide financial objectives for our expected operating results for future periods. While the information is provided based on current and projected data about the markets we deliver to and our operational capacity and capabilities, the financial objectives are subject to risks and uncertainties. If our future results do not match our financial objectives for a particular period, or if the financial objectives are reduced in future periods, the value of our common stock could decline.\nFurthermore, stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. These fluctuations, coupled with changes in results of operations and general economic, political, and market conditions, may adversely affect the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 47715, "SIC": 2520, "TIC": "KBAL"}
