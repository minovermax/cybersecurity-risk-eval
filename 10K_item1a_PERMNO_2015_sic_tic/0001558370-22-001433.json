{"cik": "1682325", "company": "GTY Technology Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur risk factors are grouped into the following categories:\n\u25cf Risks Relating to Our Business and Industries;\n\u25cf Risks Relating to SaaS, the Internet, and Technology;\n\u25cf Public Sector-Related Risk Factors; and\n\u25cf General Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industries\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.\nOur business is based on successfully attracting, retaining and motivating talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive, including as a result of departures from the workforce and work-from-anywhere policies. Maintaining our reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. If we are not successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain and motivate highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.\nThe ongoing integration of the business, management and operations of Bonfire, CityBase, eCivis, OpenCounter, Questica and Sherpa, and the integration of any additional acquisitions, may prove difficult, disrupt our business and operations, divert management attention and adversely affect the business and financial results of our consolidated company.\nWe completed the business combination in February 2019, which we continue to believe will result in benefits and synergies, including our goal of establishing an efficiently integrated public sector SaaS company through our six operating subsidiaries. We may acquire additional companies or assets, or both. Together, we have believed and continue to believe our subsidiaries can offer solutions to North American state and local governments that may not otherwise be achievable by any one individual business on its own. However, our ability to realize these anticipated benefits depends on the final, successful integration of our businesses. The consolidated company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf the inability to complete the integration of all businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner or do so without adversely impacting revenue, operations and cash flows;\n\u25cf the failure of our management team to successfully manage the consolidated business and operations of a public company;\n\u25cf expected synergies or operating efficiencies failing to materialize in whole or part, or not occurring within expected time-frames;\n\u25cf the failure to successfully manage relationships with each company\u2019s customers and their operating results and businesses generally (including the diversion of management time to react to new and unforeseen issues);\n\u25cf the failure or inability to timely and efficiently integrate and establish new sales forces without materially adversely impacting our relationships with customers;\n\u25cf the failure to accurately estimate the potential markets and market shares for the consolidated business\u2019s products, the nature and extent of competitive responses to the business combination and any additional acquisitions and the ability of the consolidated business to achieve or exceed projected market growth rates;\n\u25cf the inability to attract key personnel or to retain or motivate key personnel with unique talents, expertise or background knowledge as a consequence of both voluntary and involuntary employment actions;\n\u25cf the failure to successfully advocate the benefits of our consolidated businesses for existing and potential customers or general uncertainty regarding the value proposition of the combined entity or its products;\n\u25cf difficulties forecasting financial results;\n\u25cf failures in our financial reporting, including those resulting from system implementations in the context of our ongoing integration efforts, our ability to report or forecast financial results of the consolidated business and our inability to successfully discover and assess and integrate into our reporting system, any of which may adversely impact our ability to make timely and accurate filings with the SEC and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies; and\n\u25cf the potential that we continue to not be fully aware of the risks and potential liabilities of any of Bonfire, CityBase, eCivis, OpenCounter, Questica, Sherpa or additional acquisitions.\nOur ongoing integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses or delays, distract management from other revenue or acquisition opportunities, and increase the consolidated business\u2019s expenses and working capital requirements. If we are unable to successfully integrate all of our businesses and operations in a timely manner, the anticipated benefits of the business combination and any other acquisitions may not be fully realized, or at all, or may take longer to realize than anticipated. Should any of the foregoing or other currently unanticipated risks arise, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment that could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. As of December 31, 2021, we had $355.3 million of goodwill and net intangible assets, comprising approximately 90% of our total assets. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our earnings.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we recognized non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $15.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to the Acquisition. The fair value of the goodwill related to the Acquisition continues to be sensitive to changes in projections for revenue growth and earnings. Numerous risks may cause that fair value to fall below its carrying amount or the value of long-lived assets to not be recoverable. These risks include, but are not limited to, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, lowered expectations of future financial results, failure to fully realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, adverse changes in the business climate, and the loss of key personnel. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nCertain liabilities resulting from acquisitions are estimated and could lead to a material impact on earnings.\nAs a result of our acquisition activities, we recorded liabilities for future contingent earnout payments that are settled in cash or through the issuance of common stock. Most, but not all, of those payments have been made, and the fair value of these remaining liabilities is assessed on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions used to determine the amount of such liabilities or a change in the fair value of our common stock could lead to an adjustment that may have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our results of operations. For additional information regarding our contingent earnout liabilities, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 3 of our Financial Statements.\nOur failure to generate sufficient cash flows from our business to make payments on our debt would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn November 13, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement by and among the Company, each of the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto (each a \u201cGuarantor,\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cGuarantors\u201d), the financial institutions from time to time party thereto (each, a \u201cLender,\u201d and, collectively, \u201cLenders\u201d), and Acquiom Agency Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, as agent for the Lenders (the \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d and the facility thereunder, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is a senior secured term loan facility that provides for borrowing of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of 30 months from the borrowing of the term loans. On the closing date, we fully drew on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility replaced our prior $12,000,000 unsecured credit facility. The Loan and Security Agreement is supported by a security interest in our assets and the assets of the Guarantors party to the Loan and Security Agreement and to related guaranty agreements. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance the Credit Facility and any additional debt obligations we may incur depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or if our results of operations cause us to fail to comply with our financial covenants, we may be required to take one or more actions, including refinancing our debt, significantly reducing expenses, renegotiating our debt covenants, restructuring our debt, selling assets or obtaining additional capital, each of which may be on terms that may be onerous, highly dilutive or disruptive to our business. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, which could result in a default on our obligations, including under the Credit Facility.\nOur Credit Facility restricts our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement contains various customary covenants that limit or prohibit the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things, (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) pay certain dividends on its capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire, or make distributions in respect of its capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make certain other restricted payments; (iii) make certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments; (iv) sell certain assets, including stock of its subsidiaries; (v) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; (vi) create or incur certain liens; (vii) consolidate, merge, sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; (viii) enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; and (ix) engage in certain business activities. A violation of the covenants under the Loan and Security Agreement may result in default or an event of default.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement, the\nagent, at the direction of the lenders holding greater than 50% of the amounts outstanding, could elect to declare all amounts of such indebtedness outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate any commitments to extend further credit.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Facility would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and the United States District Court in Boston as the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur restated articles of organization designate the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts as the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, our articles of organization or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Our restated articles of organization designate the United States District Court in Boston as the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act or any claim for which other courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction including, without limitation, any claim arising under the Exchange Act. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, the United States District Court in Boston or a court outside of Massachusetts were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other venues or jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Relating to SaaS, the Internet and Technology\nCyber attacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position.\nThreats to information technology security can take a variety of forms. Individuals and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may threaten our information technology or our customers\u2019 information technology. These individuals, groups and organizations may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our customers and companies with which we have business relationships. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of our data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats.\nDisclosure of personally identifiable information or other sensitive customer data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWe store and process large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of our customers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to data security. Despite our efforts to improve security controls, it is possible that our security controls over personal data, training of employees on data security, and other practices may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data that we store and\nmanage. Disclosure of personally identifiable information or other sensitive customer data could result in material liability and harm our reputation. Additionally, data privacy and security are evolving areas of the law and our business may become subject to new and expanding regulations. Application of these new and changing laws to our business may increase risks and compliance costs.\nHosting services for some of our products and services are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers.\nA material portion of our business is provided through SaaS. These hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications or internet failure, acts of terrorism, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, and other similar damaging events. If any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period, we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments. Although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences, we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of revenue, and damage to our business.\nWe run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products.\nOur SaaS products and related services are complex and may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future. Any such defects could result in a loss of revenues, negative publicity, or delay market acceptance. Our license and subscription agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability. However, it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our customer contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions, or customers declining to negotiate these provisions. We cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive.\nThe market for our products is characterized by technological change, evolving industry standards in SaaS technology, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, and achieve market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunities and develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. The products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new SaaS products or related services or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such new products or services or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.\nMany of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts, copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property. There has also been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights. We are, and in the future may be, a party to litigation to protect our proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against one or more of the products or services with respect to current or future products or services. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be time consuming, costly, and a diversion to management. Any such claims and litigation could also cause product delivery delays or service interruptions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Therefore, litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.\nCustomers may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally.\nIt is possible that our customers may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software, trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights (excluding software applications provided on a hosted or cloud basis). This could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties, including our competitors, which could adversely affect our business.\nMaterial portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained.\nPart of our future success continues to depend on the use of the internet to access public information and perform transactions electronically. This in part requires the further and continuing development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure. Among other things, this further and continuing development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security, and the timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services. If this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained, our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals.\nSecurity breaches or unauthorized access to payment information, including credit card and debit card data, or personal information that we, or our service providers, store, process, use, or transmit for our business may harm our reputation, cause service disruptions, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant challenge to electronic commerce is the secure transmission of payment information or personal information over information technology networks and systems that process, transmit and store electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes. The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and disposal of payment information and personal information by our business is regulated at state and federal levels, and cybersecurity legislation, executive orders, and reporting requirements continue to evolve and become more complex. Because we either directly or indirectly through service providers (i) provide the electronic transmission of sensitive and personal information released from and filed with various government entities and (ii) perform online payment and electronic check processing services, we face the risk of a security breach, whether through system attacks, hacking events, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, viruses, human errors, catastrophes, or other unforeseen events that could lead to significant disruptions or compromises of information technology networks and systems or the unauthorized release or use of payment information or personal information. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the security of our own internal systems or those of our service providers could compromise the confidentiality of, or result in unauthorized access to, personal information of our employees.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology purchased or licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication tools to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including user credit card and debit card information and banking data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, threats that evolve ahead of tools designed to counter them, or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by them to protect transaction data. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, such as so-called \u201csocial engineering,\u201d or \u201cphishing,\u201d where individuals are manipulated into divulging confidential or personal information.\nDespite the various security measures that we have in place to protect payment and personal information from unauthorized disclosure and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our information technology networks and systems and those of our third-party vendors and service providers cannot be made completely secure against security breaches or disruptions. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain vulnerable to security breaches or disruptions because (i) the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected for an extended period and (ii) the security methodologies, protocols, systems, and procedures used for protection are implemented by humans at each level, and human errors may occur. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even if appropriate training is conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, able to circumvent our security measures, or those of our service providers, could misappropriate information, including but not limited to payment information and personal information, or cause interruptions or direct damage to companies with which we have relationships or that are users.\nUnder payment card rules and our contracts with our credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, process, or transmit, we could be subject to fines and be required to pay damages. We could also\nbe liable to customers and vendors for costs of investigation, notification, remediation, and credit monitoring and for any damages to users under applicable laws or our customer and vendor contracts.\nIn addition, any noncompliance with privacy and security laws or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of payment information or personal information, or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and systems, or those of our service providers (whether or not caused by a breach of our contractual obligations or our negligence), may lead to negative publicity, impair our ability to conduct our business, subject us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. It may also cause the governments with whom we contract to lose confidence in us, any of which may cause the termination or modification of our government contracts and impair our ability to win future contracts. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks affecting our environment, our service providers\u2019 environments, or our government customers\u2019 environments may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third-party security experts and consultants. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover or protect against the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system disruption. If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may also suffer significant reputational and financial losses, and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and features of our services in accordance with industry standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated technological needs of our customers on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u25cf enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and other features of the government services we offer;\n\u25cf continue to develop our technical expertise;\n\u25cf develop and introduce new services, applications, and technology to meet changing customer needs and preferences; and\n\u25cf influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be successful in responding to the above technological and industry challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, our business could be harmed.\nPublic Sector-Related Risk Factors\nSelling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of SaaS and related services to state, county, and city governments; utilities; tribal governments; and other public entities. We expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future. We face many risks and challenges associated with selling to and contracting with governmental entities, including:\n\u25cf long and complex sales cycles that vary significantly according to each government entity\u2019s policies and procedures;\n\u25cf the potential need for governments to draft and adopt specific legislation before they can circulate a request for proposal or other solicitation to which we can respond or before they can otherwise award a contract or provide a new digital service;\n\u25cf varying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance and bid protests;\n\u25cf contract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones, and differences with customers as to whether milestones have been achieved;\n\u25cf political resistance to government agencies contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information, which governments traditionally have offered without charge;\n\u25cf legislative changes that temporarily or permanently affect governments\u2019 authority to contract with third parties or receive or distribute public information or that increase our costs or result in a temporary or permanent suspension of our services;\n\u25cf regulations that govern the fees governments collect for many of our services, limiting their control over the level of transaction-based fees governments are permitted to retain;\n\u25cf various other political factors, including changes in governmental administrations and personnel that, among other things, could impact existing requests for proposals and other procurements, rebids, renewals, or extensions;\n\u25cf challenges to contractual terms and conditions that are common in the private sector, including customary warranties, limitations on liability, and indemnification;\n\u25cf government budget deficits and appropriation approval processes and periods, any of which could cause governments to curtail spending on services, including time- and materials-based fees for application development, fixed fees for portal management, and material reductions in tax revenue; and\n\u25cf resource limitations caused by budgetary constraints or non-appropriation of funds that may result in a termination of, or reduction in revenue from, executed contracts due to a lack of future funding.\nEach of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown, recession, or inflation could reduce demand for our SaaS products and services. Local and state governments may face financial pressures caused by reduced tax revenue that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future, including as a result of the public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Local and state spending levels may be affected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions, and if budget shortfalls occur, they may negatively impact local and state information technology spending and could adversely affect our business.\nThe open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards.\nMany governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process. Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate their cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed customer, and the likely terms of any other third-party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our revenue and gross margins.\nWe face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.\nWe face competition from a variety of software and SaaS vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software and SaaS. We compete based on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the breadth, depth, and quality of our product and service offerings;\n\u25cf the ability to modify our offerings to accommodate particular customers\u2019 needs;\n\u25cf technological innovation; and\n\u25cf name recognition, reputation, and references.\nWe believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size, product platform, and product scope. Our competitors include consulting firms, publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than we do. We cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.\nWe also compete with internal, centralized information technology departments of governmental entities, which requires us to persuade the end users to stop internal services and outsource to us. In addition, our customers and prospective customers could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.\nWe could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector SaaS application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships or business combinations among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products and services to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nOur ability to grow revenues may be limited by the number of governments and government agencies that choose to provide digital government solutions such as those we offer.\nOur revenues are generated principally from contracts with state and local governments and government agencies to provide digital government solutions on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions and distribute public information digitally. The growth in our revenues largely will depend on government entities adopting solutions such as those offered by us. We cannot ensure that government entities will choose to provide digital government services or continue to provide digital government services at current levels, or that they will provide such services with private assistance or by adopting solutions such as those we offer. The failure to secure contracts with certain government agencies could result in revenue levels insufficient to support our operations on a self-sustained, profitable basis.\nWe are subject to independent audits as requested by our government customers. Deficiencies in our performance under a government contract could result in contract termination, reputational damage, or financial penalties.\nEach government entity with which we contract for outsourced portal services may have the authority to require an independent audit of our performance and financial management of contracted operations. The scope of audits could include inspections of income statements, balance sheets, fee structures, collections practices, service levels, security practices, and our compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The expansion of our operations into new markets and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and rules that have previously not been relevant to our business. We cannot ensure that a future audit will not find any material performance deficiencies that would result in an adjustment to our revenues or result in financial penalties. Moreover, any consequent negative publicity could harm our reputation among other governments with which we would like to contract. These factors could harm our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLegal proceedings and investigations could harm our business and result in substantial costs.\nWe may be involved in various claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Additional legal claims or regulatory matters affecting us and our subsidiaries may arise in the future and could involve stockholder, consumer, regulatory, compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, and other issues. Litigation and investigations inherently are unpredictable. Regardless of the merits, litigation or investigations may be costly, time-consuming and disruptive to our business. We could incur costs for responding, judgments or settlements that could adversely affect our operating results or cash flows in a particular period. In addition, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.\nFluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact our operating results and stock price.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf Prospective customers\u2019 contracting decisions are often made in the last few weeks of a quarter;\n\u25cf The size of SaaS transactions can vary significantly;\n\u25cf Customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities, project objectives, budget, or personnel;\n\u25cf Customer purchasing processes vary significantly and a customer\u2019s internal approval, expenditure authorization, and bid protest and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete, even after selection of a vendor;\n\u25cf The number, timing, and significance of SaaS product enhancements and new SaaS product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions;\n\u25cf We may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies; and\n\u25cf Customers may elect subscription-based arrangements, which result in lower revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional, on-premise software license arrangements, but generate higher overall subscription-based revenues over the term of the contract.\nIn each fiscal quarter, our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below expectations, we could experience a reduction in operating results. Also, if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations, it may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nIncreases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins.\nWe realize lower margins on service revenues than on revenue from SaaS subscription or software licenses. The majority of our contracts include both SaaS and professional services. Therefore, an increase in the percentage of professional service revenue compared to SaaS revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. Examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations, new products, or new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf developments with respect to patents, copyrights, or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the SaaS and other technology industries;\n\u25cf adoption of new accounting standards, statements or interpretations affecting the SaaS industry, public companies and former special purpose acquisition companies;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u25cf general market conditions and other factors.\nIn addition, the stock market historically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nSometimes, securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, and regulatory investigations impacting us may occur over which we have limited or no control. We cannot assure you that similar litigation or investigations will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such litigation or investigations could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFuture sales of shares by existing or future stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of many shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. A significant number of our shares became free of resale restrictions on February 19, 2020, which was one year from the business combination. Additionally, a significant number of restricted stock units that may be settled in shares of common stock have been granted and will vest from time to time. The presence of additional unrestricted and vested shares of common stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nExercise of warrants for common stock would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had warrants to purchase 27,093,334 shares of common stock outstanding. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. While our stock price currently is substantially under the exercise price of the warrants - they are, in other words, underwater - to the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Moreover, this warrant overhang may limit future increases in the price of our common stock if the trading price nears the exercise price of the warrants. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur financial outlook may not be realized.\nFrom time to time, in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated revenues or earnings. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those described in this Risk Factors section), many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information when evaluating our prospective results of operations.\nOur quarterly results of operations may be volatile and difficult to predict. If our quarterly results of operations, future growth, profitability or dividends fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nOur future revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and any of which may harm our business. These factors include:\n\u25cf the commencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any quarter;\n\u25cf the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the operation of our services;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business operations and infrastructure;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in federal, state and local legislation that increase our costs and/or result in a temporary or permanent decrease in our revenues;\n\u25cf any federal government shutdown, such as the shutdown which commenced in December 2020, each of which impacts the ability of our customers to purchase our products and services;\n\u25cf the seasonal use of some of our services, particularly the payment of real estate taxes;\n\u25cf changes in economic conditions;\n\u25cf the result of negative cash flows due to capital investments; and\n\u25cf significant charges related to acquisitions.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other factors described in this Risk Factors section, our financial performance in a quarter may be lower than we anticipate and if we are unable to reduce spending in that quarter, our results of operations for that quarter may be harmed. One should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends or other market expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nEach operating subsidiary\u2019s management and our independent registered public accounting firm have previously identified internal control deficiencies, which such management and independent registered public accounting firm believed constituted material weaknesses. If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to timely and accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nEach of our operating subsidiaries was previously a private company not subject to SEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, therefore, was not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. We are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing parts of Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (other than Section 302(c) and 404(b) until we cease to be an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company), which require management to certify financial and other information in quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. We were an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021 and continue to be a smaller reporting company.\nAlthough our operating subsidiaries had not made assessments of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and did not engage their independent registered public accounting firms to conduct audits of their internal control over financial reporting, in connection with the audits of the their financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, each operating subsidiary\u2019s management and independent registered public accounting firm previously identified one or more material weaknesses relating to such subsidiary\u2019s internal control over financial reporting under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a company\u2019s financial reporting.\nThe material weaknesses previously identified by the operating subsidiaries and their independent registered public accounting firm included: (i) deficiencies in Bonfire\u2019s period end financial statement close process, (ii) each of CityBase\u2019s, eCivis\u2019s, OpenCounter\u2019s and Sherpa\u2019s limited segregation of duties with regard to financial reporting activities such as payroll entry and processing due to the size of their respective accounting departments, (iii) deficiencies in Questica\u2019s period end financial statement close process, and (iv) deficiencies in the accounting treatment and classification of the Company\u2019s private warrants.\nWe believe that we have remediated these material weaknesses and improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by implementing additional controls related thereto.\nThere is no assurance that any measures we may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. If management fails to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements and meet our SEC reporting obligations, which could result in sanctions by Nasdaq or the SEC. This could result in a loss of investor confidence and could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nThe impact of a coronavirus outbreak, or similar global health concerns, could negatively impact our operations, supply chain, and customer base.\nOur operations for certain of our products or services could be negatively impacted by the regional or global outbreak of illnesses, including the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. Any quarantines, labor shortages or other disruptions to our operations, or those of our customers, may adversely impact our sales and operating results. The absence of funding for state and local governments, which constitute substantially all the Company\u2019s customers, also may result in a reduction in revenue from, or cancellation of, the Company\u2019s contracts. That, too, may adversely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of Canada, another country in which we operate, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services. We are unable to accurately predict the possible future effect on the Company of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic or if another coronavirus or other disease expands domestically or globally.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements, and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We had revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $60.5 million. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 1, 2021, the fifth anniversary of the GTY Cayman initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, unless we continue to be a smaller reporting company, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for securities and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are a smaller reporting company (and may remain a smaller reporting company even after losing emerging growth company status), and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced or scaled reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to smaller companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d (as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), and, for as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company (which may be longer than we remain an emerging growth company), we\nmay choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to smaller reporting companies, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u25cf providing only two years of audited financial statements or compensation-related disclosure in our periodic reports and proxy statements.", "PERMNO": 16464, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "GTYH"}
