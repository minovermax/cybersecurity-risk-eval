You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses of approximately $77 million, $90 million, and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $387 million. We have generated limited revenue and have funded our operations to date primarily from public and private sales of equity and private sales of debt securities. We may incur substantial additional losses over the next few years as a result of our research, development, clinical trial and commercialization activities. As a result, we may never achieve or maintain profitability, even if we successfully commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates. If we continue to incur substantial losses and are unable to secure additional financing, we could be forced to discontinue or curtail our business operations, sell assets at unfavorable prices, refinance then-existing debt obligations on terms unfavorable to us, or merge, consolidate, or combine with a company with greater financial resources in a transaction that might be unfavorable to us.\nWe currently derive all of our revenue from sales of our women\u2019s health care products, and our failure to maintain or increase sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nIn 2017, we derived virtually all of our revenue from sales of women\u2019s health care products, including prenatal and women\u2019s multi-vitamins and iron supplements. Sales of our vitamin products varied from 2010 through 2017. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such sales or that such sales will grow. In addition to other risks described herein, our ability to maintain or increase existing product sales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe presence of new or existing competing products, including generic copies of our prescription prenatal vitamin products that are not our authorized generic products;\n\u25cf\nany supply or distribution problems arising with any of our manufacturing and distribution strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nchanged or increased regulatory restrictions or regulatory actions by the FDA;\n\u25cf\nchanges in health care laws and policy, including changes in requirements for rebates, reimbursement, and coverage by federal health care programs;\n\u25cf\nthe impact or efficacy of any price increases we may implement in the future;\n\u25cf\nchanges to our labels and labeling, including new safety warnings or changes to our boxed warning, that further restrict how we market and sell our products; and\n\u25cf\nacceptance of our products as safe and effective by physicians and patients.\nIf revenue from sales of our existing prescription prenatal vitamins does not continue or increase, we may be required to reduce our operating expenses or to seek to raise additional funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects, or we may not be able to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates or commence or continue clinical trials to seek approval for any other products we may choose to develop in the future.\nIf our products or drug candidates do not have the effects intended or cause undesirable side effects, our business may suffer.\nAlthough many of the ingredients in our current dietary supplement products are vitamins, minerals, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption, they also contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. While we believe that all of these products and the combinations of ingredients in them are safe when taken as directed, the products could have certain undesirable side effects if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer who has certain medical conditions, such as the potential effect of high doses of folic acid masking pernicious anemia. In addition, these products may not have the effect intended if they are not taken in accordance with certain instructions, which include certain dietary restrictions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of the products, even when used as directed, will have the effects intended or will not have harmful side effects in an unforeseen way or on an unforeseen cohort. If any of our products or products we develop or commercialize in the future are shown to be harmful or generate negative publicity from perceived harmful effects, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed significantly.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates designed to alleviate symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause, including VMS and VVA.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause, including hot flashes and dyspareunia. We have submitted IND applications for six hormone therapy drug candidates, which the FDA has allowed to proceed, and which permit us to conduct clinical testing on these proposed products. In December 2015, we completed a phase 3 clinical trial of our TX-004HR drug candidate and in December 2016 we completed a phase 3 clinical trial for our TX-001HR drug candidate. We have submitted NDAs for both drug candidates. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we submitted an IND application for our TX-006HR drug candidate and intend to commence phase 1 clinical trials of this drug candidate as early as 2018. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment in the phase 3 clinical trial for our TX-002HR drug candidate and in October 2014 we stopped the trial and are considering whether to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. We have currently suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drug candidates and the IND application for this drug candidate is currently inactive. We have no current plans to conduct clinical trials for our TX-003HR drug candidate and the IND application for this drug candidate is currently inactive. Drug development is a necessarily uncertain undertaking. We may not be able to complete the development of our drug candidates, the results of the clinical trials may not be sufficient to support an NDA for any of our drug candidates, and even if we believe the results of our clinical trials are sufficient to support any NDA that we submit, the FDA may disagree and may not approve our NDA. In addition, even if the FDA approves one or more of our NDAs, it may do so with restrictions on the intended uses that may make commercialization of the product or products financially untenable. The failure to commercialize or obtain necessary approval for any one or more of these products could substantially harm our prospects and our business.\nWe may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates if we fail to obtain additional financing.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the clinical development and commercialization of our hormone therapy drug candidates. Our existing cash may not be sufficient to fund these requirements. In addition, changing circumstances may cause us to consume funds significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected on these programs. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. We may attempt to raise additional capital from the issuance of equity or debt securities, collaborations with third parties, licensing of rights to our products, or other means, or a combination of any of the foregoing. Securing additional financing will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to take one or more of the following actions:\n\u25cf\nsignificantly delay, scale back, or discontinue our product development and commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf\nseek collaborators for our hormone therapy drug candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be the case; and\n\u25cf\nlicense, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to our hormone therapy drug candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nDebt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or proposed products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing discovery, development, and commercialization efforts, and our ability to generate revenue and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed.\nWe have no experience as a company in bringing a drug to regulatory approval.\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, a drug. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for our TX-001HR drug candidate for substantive review or may conclude, after review of our data, that one or more of our NDAs are insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of any of our hormone therapy drug candidates. We have begun to conduct validation and scale up of the manufacturing processes for TX-001HR, our proposed combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate, and TX-004HR, our proposed applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate. The FDA may also require that we conduct additional clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly and time-consuming, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available or can secure. Any delay or inability in obtaining regulatory approvals would delay or prevent us from commercializing our hormone therapy drug candidates, generating revenue from these proposed products, and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA we submit. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our planned NDAs for one or more of our hormone therapy drug candidates, which would materially adversely affect our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nWe have completed our phase 3 clinical trials of TX-001HR for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus and TX-004HR for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia in menopausal women with VVA. Although we have discussed our clinical development plans for each drug candidate with the FDA, the agency may ultimately determine that our phase 3 clinical trials for one or both candidates are not sufficient for regulatory approval. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or non-clinical studies, our development of TX-001HR or TX-004HR, as applicable, will be more time-consuming and costly than we presently anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn December 5, 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the REPLENISH Trial, our phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TX-001HR, an investigational bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17\u00df-estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel, for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The REPLENISH Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo in 1,835 menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The doses studied were: 17\u00df-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg; 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg; 17\u00df-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg; and 17\u00df-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424). The REPLENISH Trial results demonstrated that TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo. TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints; the estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose. The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the FDA\u2019s draft guidance. Based on the results of the REPLENISH Trial, we currently intend to seek regulatory approval for the estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg doses of TX-001HR for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus in the U.S.\nOn December 7, 2015, we announced positive top-line results from the REJOICE Trial, our phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses-25 mcg, 10 mcg and 4 mcg (compared to placebo)-of TX-004HR for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia in menopausal women with VVA. Both the 25 mcg dose and the 10 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary efficacy endpoints. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR also demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoints of vaginal superficial cells, vaginal parabasal cells, and vaginal pH; the change from baseline compared to placebo in the severity of dyspareunia was statistically significant at the p = 0.0149 level. As discussed below, where an NDA is supported by a single clinical trial, as is the case with TX-004HR, the FDA has taken the position initially that the results of our trial would have to achieve statistical significance at the 0.01 level or better. Statistical significance at the 0.0149 level may not be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. If the FDA continues to maintain this position, we may have to either conduct an additional trial or eliminate the 4 mcg dose formulation from the TX-004HR NDA. The elimination of this low dose from our product line could adversely affect our sales of TX-004HR, if approved.\nWe cannot assure you that the FDA will approve all or any doses of TX-001HR or TX-004HR for commercialization. The FDA may not agree with one or more aspects of our clinical trial designs, including the duration of the trials, clinical endpoints, controls, dose ranges, collection of safety data, level of statistical significance, or adequacy of our non-clinical studies.\nOur TX-001HR or TX-004HR hormone therapy drug candidates are currently undergoing stability testing. The FDA will review the period of time that our drug candidates are stable, which will dictate the amount of time post-manufacturing that the products may be used by patients, if approved. If our hormone therapy drug candidates fail to remain stable or the period of time that they remain stable is too short, it could limit the commercial viability of our products, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, prior to approval of an NDA, the FDA may audit one or more of the sites where the applicable phase 3 clinical trial was conducted to ensure the integrity of the data, inspect our clinical records in our corporate offices, and will inspect the facilities of our third party contract manufacturers where the applicable drug candidate will be manufactured commercially, if approved and where the drug was manufactured for clinical trials. If one or more site audits reveals anomalies, or if the manufacturing facilities do not pass inspection, full consideration of the NDA by the FDA could be delayed, or the FDA may require us to undertake further clinical or non-clinical trials or could require our contract manufacturers to improve or change their processes, any of which would delay or prevent commercialization of the applicable drug candidate and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClinical trials are lengthy and expensive with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete and have highly uncertain outcomes. For example, we suspended enrollment in and subsequently stopped the SPRY trial for our progesterone alone drug candidate in order to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols, or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. Prior to approving a new drug, the FDA generally requires that the safety and efficacy of the drug be demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. In some situations, the FDA approves drugs on the basis of a single well-controlled clinical trial. We believe we may be required to conduct only a single phase 3 clinical trial of each of TX-001HR, our proposed combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate, TX-002HR, our progesterone alone drug candidate, and TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate. However, in connection with our TX-004HR drug candidate, the FDA has previously indicated to us that in order to approve the drug based on a single trial, the trial would need to show statistical significance at the 0.01 level or lower for each endpoint, and that a trial that is merely statistically significant at a higher numerical level may not provide sufficient evidence to support an NDA filing or approval of a drug candidate where the NDA relies on a single clinical trial. If clinical trials for any of our hormone therapy drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our existing women\u2019s health care products and our hormone therapy drug candidates may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing, commercializing, and marketing our products.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to build, the infrastructure or capability to internally manufacture our existing women\u2019s health care products or our hormone therapy drug candidates. We have relied, and will continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture these products in accordance with our specifications and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. We have entered into long-term supply agreements with Catalent for the commercial supply of our TX-001HR and TX-004HR hormone therapy drug candidates. Under the terms of the agreements, we will be obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of each product once we commence commercial sales of such product following regulatory approval of Catalent as a manufacturer of the product. We depend on Lang, a full-service, private label and corporate brand manufacturer, to supply approximately 100% of our vitaMedMD and BocaGreen products. We do not have long-term contracts for the commercial supply of our existing women\u2019s health care products, however, in certain circumstances, including our failure to satisfy our production forecasts to Lang, we may be obligated to reimburse Lang for the costs of excess raw materials purchased by Lang that it cannot use in another product category that it then sells.\nRegulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our existing women\u2019s health care products and our hormone therapy drug candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with cGMP regulations. As a result, the facilities used by any of our current or future manufacturers must be approved by the FDA. Holders of NDAs, or other forms of FDA approvals or clearances, or those distributing a regulated product under their own name, are responsible for manufacturing even though that manufacturing is conducted by a third-party CMO. All of our existing products are, and our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, will be manufactured by CMOs. These CMOs are required by the terms of our contracts to manufacture our products in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. The CMO that will manufacture our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, has previously been inspected by the FDA and received Form 483 observations with respect to its softgel manufacturing plant that will be used for the manufacture of the commercial supply of TX-001HR and TX-004HR, if approved. As part of the PAI of our NDA for TX-004HR, the FDA inspected Catalent\u2019s manufacturing facilities that would be used to manufacture the product; we anticipate that as part of the PAI of our NDA for TX-001HR, the FDA may again inspect Catalent\u2019s manufacturing facilities that would be used to manufacture that product. If this inspection results in Form 483 observations, the approval of our NDA could be delayed significantly. The CMO that manufactured the hormone therapy drug candidates used in our recently completed phase 3 clinical trials for TX-001HR and TX-004HR was recently inspected by the FDA, which issued it a Form FDA-483 listing various observations, some of which pertained to the clinical supply of our TX-001HR and TX-004HR drug candidates. The CMO has submitted its written response to the Form 483 observations to the FDA, however, neither we nor the CMO has been informed by the FDA as to whether the CMO\u2019s response addresses and remediates these observations in a manner satisfactory to the FDA. If this CMO is not able to address and remediate the FDA\u2019s observations pertaining to the clinical supply of our TX-001HR and TX-004HR drug candidates in a manner satisfactory to the FDA, it could have a material adverse effect on the FDA\u2019s review of our NDA for TX-004HR or the timing of our anticipated submission of an NDA for TX-001HR.\nIf our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA and any applicable foreign regulatory authority, they will not be able to secure the applicable approval for their manufacturing facilities. If these facilities are not approved for the commercial manufacture of our existing products or our hormone therapy drug candidates, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would result in disruptions of our sales and significant delays of up to several years in obtaining approval for our hormone therapy drug candidates. In addition, our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMP regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply, recalls, withdrawals, issuance of safety alerts, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Finally, we also could experience manufacturing delays if our CMOs give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products and proposed products or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us.\nWe also do not have long-term contracts for the supply of the API used in our hormone therapy drug candidates. If any supplier of the API or other products used in our hormone therapy drug candidates experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of an agreement between us, or does not devote sufficient time, energy, and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our hormone therapy drug candidates, which could impair our ability to supply our hormone therapy drug candidates at the levels required for commercialization and prevent or delay their successful commercialization.\nFuture legislation, or the absence of such legislation, regulations, and policies adopted by the FDA or other regulatory authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials for our hormone therapy drug candidates.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines, and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements resulting from the adoption of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly and adversely affect the cost, timing, and completion of the clinical trials for our hormone therapy drug candidates.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be issued that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, or impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. For example, in the past the FDA has indicated it would regulate prenatal vitamins containing greater than 0.8 mg of folic acid as a drug under the FDCA. More recently the FDA indicated that there is no specified upper limit on the amount of folic acid permitted in a dietary supplement. If the FDA were to seek to regulate products with higher amounts of folic acid as drugs, it may require us to stop selling certain of our dietary supplement products and otherwise adversely affect our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, prospects, and ability to achieve or sustain profitability could be adversely affected.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our hormone therapy drug candidates, we will still face extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements and review, and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our hormone therapy drug candidates in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or to the conditions for approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials or post-market surveillance. As a condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in these post-approval clinical trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. For example, the labeling for our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, may include restrictions on use or warnings. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, gives the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved REMS programs. If approved, our hormone therapy drug candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record keeping, and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. Foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs. Post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect sales of our hormone therapy drug candidates once approved, and potentially our other marketed products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our approved products. Accordingly, new data about our products could negatively affect demand because of real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal or recall. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, and practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products.\nThe holder of an approved NDA also is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMPs regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility, or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing, requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug, requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials, imposing new monitoring requirements, or requiring that we establish a REMS program. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws. We would also be required under the Sunshine provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on payments that we make to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownerships interests in the company held by physicians. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Healthcare Act of 1992. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration and to low income patients of certain hospitals, additional laws and requirements apply. Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or our third-party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may take any of the following actions:\n\u25cf\nconduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u25cf\nissue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u25cf\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\nrequire that we suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u25cf\nexclude us from providing our products to those participating in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events or penalties may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenue. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe commercial success of our existing products and our hormone therapy drug candidates that we develop, if approved in the future, will depend upon gaining and retaining significant market acceptance of these products among physicians and payors.\nPhysicians may not prescribe our products, including any of our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, which would prevent us from generating revenue or becoming profitable. Market acceptance of our products, including our hormone therapy drug candidates, by physicians, patients, and payors, will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe clinical indications for which our hormone therapy drug candidates are approved, if at all;\n\u25cf\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including numerous generic drug products;\n\u25cf\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our products in the treatment of the symptoms for which they are intended;\n\u25cf\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive drugs;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling; and\n\u25cf\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects.\nEven if the medical community accepts that our products are safe and efficacious for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to the use or may be slow to adopt our products as an accepted treatment for the symptoms for which they are intended. We cannot assure you that any labeling approved by the FDA will permit us to promote our products as being superior to competing products. If our products, including, in particular our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient or any revenue from these products and we may not become profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nOur products, including our hormone therapy drug candidates if approved, face significant competition from branded and generic products, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nDevelopment and awareness of our brand will depend largely upon our success in increasing our customer base. The dietary supplement and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our products, including any hormone therapy drug candidates that may be approved, face intense competition, including from major multinational pharmaceutical and dietary supplement companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical, and generic drug companies. A non-hormonal product, Brisdelle, produced by Noven Pharmaceuticals, was approved by the FDA for treatment of VMS in June 2013. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources, such as larger research and development staffs and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. They also may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the products that we sell or develop obsolete. As a result, our competitors may succeed in commercializing products before we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. If we are unable to economically promote or maintain our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be severely harmed. In addition, our efforts to provide an alternative to the non-FDA-approved compound bioidentical market for estradiol and progesterone products sold by compounding pharmacies may not be successful.\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably, or if available, government mandated rebates may be too high and may adversely affect our profitability.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our products, including any hormone therapy drug candidates, will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors generally do not cover OTC products, and coverage for vitamins and dietary supplements varies. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our products, including any hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, or whether the amount of such coverage and reimbursement, if any, will be sufficient to enable us to successfully compete with other products.\nSpecifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and certain others by establishing a new Part D to the Medicare program. However, unlike traditional Medicare-which provides coverage for outpatient drugs-coverage under Part D is provided by private insurers operating under contract with CMS. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of certain outpatient drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These and future cost-reduction initiatives could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our products from Medicare, if any, including our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, and could significantly harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement under Medicare may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act became law in the United States. The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other measures, ACA increased rebates on manufacturers for certain covered drug products reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full effect that the Affordable Care Act will have on federal reimbursement policies in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on drug reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of our products. In addition, we cannot predict whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted. If the ACA or parts of it are repealed, it is unclear what impact that would have on drug reimbursements or coverage and it is equally unclear what programs, if any, Congress might enact to replace the repealed portions of the ACA.\nThe availability of generic products at lower prices than branded products may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for branded products, such as our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products generally due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we could have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval outside the U.S. will prevent us from marketing our drug candidates in non- U.S. markets.\nWe may attempt to market certain of our drug candidates in non-U.S. markets. In order to market our drug candidates in the European Union and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have had limited interactions with non-U.S. regulatory authorities, the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval or clearance. Approval or clearance by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-U.S. regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by other regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval or clearance. If we pursue non-U.S. regulatory approvals, we may not obtain them on a timely basis, if at all. If we pursue non-U.S. regulatory approvals, our failure to receive necessary approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in a given market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, if we seek and obtain approval to market our drug candidates in one or more non-U.S. markets, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those markets relating to our product. In some countries, particularly countries of the European Union, each of which has developed its own rules and regulations, pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of regulatory approval for a drug. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidates to other available products. If reimbursement of our drug candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability with respect to any given market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nFuture legislation or regulations may adversely affect reimbursement from government programs\nLegislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reductions, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction of several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, signed into law on November 2, 2015, increased the rebates that generic drug manufacturers are obligated to pay under the Medicaid program by applying an inflation-based rebate formula to generic drugs that previously only applied to brand name drugs. If we ever obtain regulatory approval and commercialization of any of our drug candidates, these new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act, which, among other things, may increase the types of clinical trial designs that would be acceptable to support an NDA. It is unclear, at this time, how these provisions will be implemented or whether they would have any effect on our company.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates may be. If the ACA or parts of it are repealed, it is unclear what impact that would have on drug reimbursements or coverage and it is equally unclear what programs, if any, Congress and the Trump Administration might enact and sign into law to replace the repealed portions of the ACA.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the marketing of our current products and the clinical testing of our hormone therapy drug candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants. Additionally, in light of the history of product liability claims related to other hormone replacement therapy products, we will face an even greater risk if we obtain FDA approval and commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates in the United States or other additional jurisdictions or if we engage in the clinical testing of proposed new products or commercialize any additional products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, failures to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, or breaches of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our existing products or hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in any of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe inability to commercialize our products or hormone therapy drug candidates;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty recruiting subjects for clinical trials or withdrawal of these subjects before a trial is completed;\n\u25cf\nlabeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls or withdrawals;\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for our products or products that we may develop in the future;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u25cf\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and\n\u25cf\na decline in our stock price.\nAlthough we maintain general liability insurance of up to $10 million in the aggregate and clinical trial liability insurance of $10 million in the aggregate for our hormone therapy drug candidates, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur business may be affected by unfavorable publicity or lack of consumer acceptance.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer acceptance of a product can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention, and other publicity about product use. A product may be received favorably, resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or any of our particular products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. A future research report or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less than favorable or that may question earlier favorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of our product or any other similar product with illness or other adverse effects, or that questions the benefits of our product or a similar product, or that claims that such products do not have the effect intended could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical, biological, and radioactive materials. In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our procedures for use, handling, storing, and disposing of these materials (all of which only occur at third-party sites operated by our contractors) comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. We also cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources, and we do not carry liability insurance covering the use of hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with applicable requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs, or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve or maintain compliance. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.\nThe products we currently market, including the vitamins, and the pharmaceutical products we are developing and planning to develop in the future, are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation, including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including its Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to the extent our products are paid for directly or indirectly by those departments, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates dietary supplements, cosmetics, and drugs under different regulatory schemes. For example, the FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and distribution of dietary supplements and cosmetics under its dietary supplement and cosmetic authority, respectively. The FDA also regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products under various regulatory provisions. If any drug products we develop are tested or marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\nGovernment regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling products. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in, by way of example, significant fines, criminal and civil liability, product seizures, recalls, withdrawals, withdrawals of approvals, and exclusion and debarment from government programs. Any of these actions, including the inability of our hormone therapy drug candidates to obtain and maintain regulatory approval, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are subject to additional federal and state laws and regulations relating to our business, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe are subject to additional health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u25cf\nthe federal health care program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under government health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nfederal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters; and\n\u25cf\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nFurther, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity can now be found guilty of fraud or false claims under ACA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Possible sanctions for violation of these anti-kickback laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe ACA also imposes new reporting requirements on device and pharmaceutical manufacturers to make annual public disclosures of payments to certain health care providers and physician ownership of their stock by health care providers. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not reported. Manufacturers were required to begin data collection on August 1, 2013 and were required to report such data to CMS by March 31, 2014.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of health care reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any changes in these laws. Federal or state regulatory authorities may challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, and medical personnel. In order to induce valuable employees to remain with us, we have, among other things, provided stock-based compensation that vests over time. The value to employees of stock-based compensation will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We do not have employment agreements with a number of our key employees. As a result, most employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that any of these employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice, and may go to work for a competitor. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled scientific and medical personnel.\nAny failure to adequately expand a direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe expect to be substantially dependent on a direct sales force to attract new business and to manage customer relationships. We plan to expand our direct sales force and believe that there is significant competition for qualified, productive direct sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient direct sales personnel. New and future hires may not become as productive as expected, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets in which we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive sales personnel our business prospects could suffer.\nOther pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel may have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and longer histories than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, our ability to commercialize drug candidates may be limited.\nOur success is tied to our distribution channels.\nWe sell our prescription prenatal vitamin products to wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy distributors. During the year ended December 31, 2017, four customers each generated more than 10% of our total revenues; revenue generated from these four customers combined accounted for approximately 59% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our business would be harmed if any of these customers refused to distribute our products or refused to purchase our products on commercially favorable terms to us.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for our products could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nOur ability to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand depends on the performance of third-party contract manufacturers. In some instances, our products have unique ingredients used under license arrangements. If our manufacturers are unsuccessful in obtaining raw materials, if we are unable to manufacture and release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, if we fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, if inventory is destroyed or damaged, or if our inventory reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access to our products, our reputation and brands could be harmed, and physicians may be less likely to recommend our products in the future, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDelays in clinical trials are common for many reasons, and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nWe may experience delays in future clinical trials for our drug candidates. Clinical trials might not begin on time; may be interrupted, delayed, suspended, or terminated once commenced; might need to be redesigned; might not enroll a sufficient number of patients; or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf\nimposition of a clinical hold because of safety or efficacy concerns by the DSMB, FDA, or IRB, or us;\n\u25cf\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u25cf\ndelays in identifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u25cf\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable API; or\n\u25cf\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of DSMB for a trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Any of these delays in completing future clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue from our drug candidates subject to the trial.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials because of adverse side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our drug candidates.\nClinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities because of a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any proposed product that we develop, the commercial prospects of such proposed product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these proposed products will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects significantly.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our research and development activities, including our clinical trials, and we may experience delays in obtaining or may be unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for, or in commercializing, our hormone therapy drug candidates if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines.\nWe do not have the resources to independently conduct research and development activities. Therefore, we have relied, and plan to continue to rely, on various third-party CROs to conduct our research and development activities and to recruit patients and monitor and manage data for our on-going clinical programs for our hormone therapy drug candidates, as well as for the execution of clinical studies. Although we control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We cannot assure you that the CROs will conduct the research properly or in a timely manner, or that the results will be reproducible. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable or invalid, and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our proposed products. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness compared to placebo of our hormone therapy drug candidates to a statistically significant degree, our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Any clinical trial that a CRO conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, we do not employ the personnel of our CROs, and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such organizations, we cannot control whether or not they will devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical and pre-clinical programs. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including one or more of our competitors, for which they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised because of the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates that we seek to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our hormone therapy drug candidates that we seek to develop could be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed or end.\nWe typically engage one or more CROs on a project-by-project basis for each study or trial. While we have developed and plan to maintain our relationships with CROs that we have previously engaged, we also expect to enter into agreements with other CROs to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to on-going clinical programs and, specifically, the compilation of clinical trial data for submission with an NDA for each of our hormone therapy drug candidates. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and can increase our costs significantly. Although we try to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $338.6 million. Subject to applicable limitations, these NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income, to the extent we generate any taxable income, and thereby reduce our future federal income taxes otherwise payable.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an ownership change as defined in Section 382. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percent over a three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We may be found to have experienced an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of events in the past or the issuance of shares of our common stock in the future. If so, the use of our NOLs, or a portion thereof, against our future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent and imposing new restrictions on the use of NOLs. The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. We must assess whether our valuation allowance analyses with respect to our NOLs are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act. Furthermore, the Tax Act limits the NOL carryover deduction in a taxable year to the lesser of the NOL carryforward or 80 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income (before taking into account any deduction on account of such NOLs), which may restrict our ability to offset future taxable income with NOLs and increase our future federal income taxes otherwise payable.\nSince we have recorded provisional amounts related to certain portions of the Tax Act, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in a valuation allowance or otherwise is also provisional.\nOur business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state, and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.\nIn connection with the products we sell and intend to sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees (\u201ctax\u201d or \u201ctaxes\u201d) to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities. In addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of tax laws (including the recently enacted Tax Act) is uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and services.\nIn the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur success depends on how efficiently we respond to changing consumer preferences and demand.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends and preferences. We may not be able to respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to these changes. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact our inventory levels, sales, and consumer opinion of us as a source for the latest product. The success of our new product offerings depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to achieve the following:\n\u25cf\naccurately anticipate customer needs;\n\u25cf\ninnovate and develop new products;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully commercialize new products in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\ncompetitively price our products in the market;\n\u25cf\nprocure and maintain products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf\ndifferentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products, make enhancements to existing products, or maintain the appropriate inventory levels to meet customers\u2019 demand in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may initiate product recalls or withdrawals, or may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions that could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals, or seizures if any of the products we formulate, manufacture, or sell are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the manufacture, labeling, promotion, sale, or distribution of any of our products. A recall, withdrawal, or seizure of any of our products could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal, or seizure of any of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 173 full time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial, sales and marketing, and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate, and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional drug candidates. If we are unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to increase revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective and efficient information systems or properly safeguard our information systems.\nOur operations are dependent on uninterrupted performance of our information systems. Failure to maintain reliable information systems, disruptions in our existing information systems or the implementation of new systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, including violations of patient privacy and confidentiality requirements and other regulatory requirements, increased administrative expenses and other adverse consequences.\nIn addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of new technologies and the increased activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks resulting in the theft of protected health, business, or financial information. Despite our layered security controls, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our information systems and misappropriate or compromise sensitive patient or personnel information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that disable our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics.\nA failure in or breach of our information systems as a result of cyber-attacks or other tactics could disrupt our business, result in the release or misuse of protected health information, or PHI, confidential or proprietary business information or financial loss, damage our reputation, increase our administrative expenses, and expose us to additional risk of liability to federal or state governments or individuals. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and disruption of our operations. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of patient healthcare and other sensitive information, proprietary or confidential information about us or other third-parties could expose such persons\u2019 private information to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or such persons to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur employees and business partners may not appropriately secure and protect confidential information in their possession.\nEach of our employees and business partners is responsible for the security of the information in our systems or under our control and to ensure that private and financial information is kept confidential. Should an employee or business partner not follow appropriate security measures, including those related to cyber threats or attacks or other tactics, as well as our privacy and security policies and procedures, the improper release of personal information, including PHI, or confidential business or financial information, or misappropriation of assets could result. The release of such information or misappropriation of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nAnother party could develop hormone therapy products and obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity in the United States before we do, potentially preventing our ability to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates and other products in development.\nWe plan to seek to obtain market exclusivity for our hormone therapy drug candidates and any other drug candidates we develop in the future. To the extent that patent protection is not available or has expired, FDA marketing exclusivity may be the only available form of exclusivity available for these proposed products. Marketing exclusivity can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. Potentially competitive products may also be seeking marketing exclusivity and may be in various stages of development, including some more advanced than us. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval or whether FDA approval will be granted, nor can we predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval for competing products or whether such approval will be granted. It is possible that competing products may obtain FDA approval with marketing exclusivity before we do, which could delay our ability to submit a marketing application or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, result in lost market opportunities with respect to our hormone therapy drug candidates, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our hormone therapy drug candidates and other products are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent positions as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our hormone therapy drug candidates and other products. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action, and we cannot be certain that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the United States, such as the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength, and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThese risks include the possibility of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe patent applications that we have filed may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged or discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient, incomplete, or incorrect information, and thus held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u25cf\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensors may not have been the first inventors to file patent applications for these technologies in the United States or were not the first to file patent applications directed to these technologies abroad;\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u25cf\nfuture drug candidates may not be patentable;\n\u25cf\nothers may claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights that we hold or license;\n\u25cf\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials, and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our drug candidates under patent protection; and\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products.\nWhile we apply for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate, many third parties may already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities\u2019 applications, patents, and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, or commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates. In addition, if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation, or other proceedings with the USPTO or foreign patent regulatory authorities to determine our rights in the technologies, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged in the courts or in post-grant proceedings at the USPTO, or in similar proceedings in foreign countries. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims.\nIf we, our licensors, or our strategic partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our hormone therapy drug candidates or future drug candidates, if approved, may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage, and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by generic drug marketers to our patents prior to, or immediately following, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as \u201cat risk\u201d launches to challenge relevant patent rights.\nOur business also may rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, and trade secrets. If the confidentiality of this intellectual property is breached, it could adversely impact our business.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products. We are aware of numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications that exist in the areas of hormone therapy, including compounds, formulations, treatment methods, and synthetic processes, which may be applied towards the synthesis of hormones. Patent applications are confidential when filed and remain confidential until publication, approximately 18 months after initial filing, while some patent applications remain unpublished until issuance. As such, there may be other third-party patents and pending applications of which we are currently unaware with claims directed towards composition of matter, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or drug candidates. Therefore, we cannot ever know with certainty the nature or existence of every third-party patent filing. We cannot provide assurances that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our drug candidates as planned or that we or our licensors\u2019 and partners\u2019 patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties. If any third-party patent was held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of any of our drug candidates, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain a license to such patent on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain such license may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry generally. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including the following:\n\u25cf\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time-consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital, and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u25cf\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; or\n\u25cf\nredesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nWe are party from time to time to legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property, and third parties in the future may file claims asserting that our technologies, processes, or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our drug candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our drug candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe have submitted, and intend to submit, NDAs for our hormone therapy drug candidates, assuming that the clinical data justify submission, under Section 505(b)(2), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA when at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to any patents for the approved product on which the application relies that are listed in the FDA\u2019s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product\u2019s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification.\nIf the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30 month period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45 day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time.\nIf we cannot certify that all of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our hormone therapy drug candidates have expired, we will be compelled to include a Paragraph IV certification in the NDA for such drug candidate. Our inability to certify that all of the patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our hormone therapy drug candidates could have significant adverse effects on the timing for obtaining approval of our hormone therapy drug candidates.\nWe may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of our licensors, do not cover the technology in question or on other grounds. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries in which the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States or in those countries in which we do not file national phase patent applications. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, if securities analysts or investors perceive public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of certain information, the value of our products and technology could be materially adversely affected.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers, and collaborators. We cannot, however, ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached. In addition, enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets, know-how, or technological advancements is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect this information. Moreover, our trade secrets, know-how, and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties. If any such events were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or of other third parties with whom we have obligations of confidentiality.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock on Nasdaq is likely to be volatile. This volatility may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which include the following:\n\u25cf\nany delay in filing our NDAs for our hormone therapy drug candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of the NDAs, including the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or proposed products, including clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our hormone therapy drug candidates;\n\u25cf\na decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nany delay of our phase 3 clinical trials for our hormone therapy drug candidates;\n\u25cf\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to obtain adequate clinical supply for our hormone therapy drug candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new products or technologies offered by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our or our potential strategic partners\u2019 commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply and any commercialization strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators, and the investment community;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u25cf\nthe overall performance of the U.S. equity markets and general political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u25cf\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nincreases in our common stock available for sale upon expiration of lock-up agreements;\n\u25cf\neffects of natural or man-made catastrophic events or other business interruptions; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our stock, and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 73% of our common stock on an as converted basis. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nIf we fail to maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required annually to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required annually to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for future periods as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements, and investors may therefore lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will be limited to the value of their stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as certain provisions of Nevada law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders, and could also make it more difficult to remove our current management. These provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws include the following:\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u25cf\nadvance notice provisions in connection with stockholder proposals that may prevent or hinder any attempt by our stockholders to bring business to be considered by our stockholders at a meeting or replace our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to Nevada\u2019s Combination with Interested Stockholders statute (Nevada Revised Statute Sections 78.411 - 78.444), which prohibits an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d from entering into a \u201ccombination\u201d with a company, unless certain conditions are met. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns (or within the prior two years, did beneficially own) 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s capital stock entitled to vote.", "PERMNO": 13863, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TXMD"}
