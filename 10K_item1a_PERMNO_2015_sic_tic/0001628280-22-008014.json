{"cik": "1785592", "company": "Leafly Holdings, Inc. /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that we believe make an investment in Leafly speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found after this summary, and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) before making an investment decision regarding Leafly.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\n\u2022We have a relatively short operating history in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\n\u2022The legal cannabis industry and market are relatively new, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or develop as anticipated, or we may ultimately be unable to succeed in this new industry and market.\n\u2022Expansion of our business is dependent on the continued and future legalization of cannabis.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022We have a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially as our costs increase.\n\u2022If we fail to maintain and expand our brand and retailer client base, our revenue and our business will be harmed.\n\u2022Our international operations involve additional risks, and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand internationally.\n\u2022Our payment system and the payment systems of our suppliers depend on third-party providers and are subject to evolving laws and regulations.\n\u2022The traffic to our website and mobile application may decline and our business may suffer if other companies copy information from our platform and publish or aggregate it with other information for their own benefit.\n\u2022If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and our business would be adversely affected.\n\u2022If our current marketing model is not effective in attracting new brand and retailer clients, we may need to employ higher-cost sales and marketing methods to attract and retain brand and retailer clients, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022We rely upon cloud-based data centers, infrastructure and technologies provided by third parties, and technology systems and electronic networks supplied and managed by third parties, to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these systems, technologies and networks may adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\u2022We face potential liability and expense for legal claims based on the content on our platform.\n\u2022We may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations or adversely affecting our ability to operate our business.\nRegulatory Risks\n\u2022Our business is dependent on U.S. state laws and regulations and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations pertaining to the cannabis industry.\n\u2022The laws and regulations regarding hemp-derived products are unsettled, and an adverse change in U.S. federal policy towards our suppliers would materially affect our business and operations.\n\u2022We cannot ensure that our suppliers will conduct their business activities in a manner compliant with regulations and requirements applicable to the cannabis industry.\n\u2022Any actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security obligations could harm our business.\n\u2022Our business and operating results may be harmed if we are deemed responsible for the collection and remittance of state sales taxes or other indirect taxes for suppliers using our order functionality.\nAdditional Risks Relating to the Cannabis Industry\n\u2022Cannabis remains illegal under federal law and, therefore, strict enforcement of federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to execute our business plan.\n\u2022Our business and our suppliers are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws regarding financial transactions related to cannabis, which could subject our suppliers to legal claims or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We are dependent on our banking relationships, and we may have difficulty accessing or consistently maintaining banking or other financial services due to our connection with the cannabis industry.\n\u2022Due to our involvement in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate our business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial liability.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022We are, and may in the future be, subject to disputes and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights. These disputes may be costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\n\u2022Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our brand, business and results of operations.\nPublic Company and Financial Reporting Risks\n\u2022We are incurring and will continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\n\u2022The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\n\u2022Our projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. As a result, our actual revenues, market share, expenses and profitability may differ materially from our expectations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\u2022We qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, it could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance to the performance of other public companies.\n\u2022Our stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\n\u2022An active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained.\n\u2022Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a relatively short operating history in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe have a relatively short operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as we anticipate, if at all. Both our short operating history and the pace of dramatic change in the cannabis industry makes it difficult to assess our future prospects, and you should evaluate our business in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter as the industry continues to evolve. These risks and difficulties include our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022increase the number of users of our website and mobile applications (which we refer to as our \u201cplatform\u201d), the number of reviews and other content on our platform and our revenue;\n\u2022successfully implement and scale our online order reservation system, by attracting new retailers and brands (which we refer to from time to time, collectively, as \u201csuppliers\u201d) while simultaneously converting visitors to our platform into customers of our suppliers;\n\u2022effectively monetize our mobile applications as usage continues to migrate toward mobile devices;\n\u2022manage, measure and demonstrate the effectiveness of our advertising solutions and attract and retain new advertising partners, many of which may only have limited or no online advertising experience;\n\u2022successfully compete with existing and future providers of other forms of offline and online advertising;\n\u2022successfully compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the business of providing order reservation, e-commerce, online ordering, and/or delivery services related to cannabis products and services;\n\u2022successfully expand our business in new and existing markets, both domestic and international;\n\u2022successfully develop and deploy new features and services;\n\u2022avoid interruptions or disruptions in our platform or services;\n\u2022adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the cannabis industry and the way consumers and cannabis industry businesses interact with technology;\n\u2022develop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage globally, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\n\u2022hire, integrate and retain talented sales and other personnel;\n\u2022effectively manage rapid growth in our sales force, personnel and operations;\n\u2022effectively partner with other companies; and\n\u2022successfully navigate complex, disparate and rapidly evolving regulatory regimes imposed by U.S. and Canadian federal, state and provincial, local and other non-U.S. governments applicable to cannabis and cannabis-related businesses.\nIf the demand for our services, including our advertising solutions, does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs of this demand, our business will be harmed. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties or others, including those described elsewhere in these risk factors. Failure to adequately address these risks and difficulties could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe legal cannabis industry and market are relatively new, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or develop as anticipated, or we may ultimately be unable to succeed in this new industry and market.\nWe are operating our business in a relatively new cannabis industry and market, and our success depends in part on broader consumer adoption of the legal cannabis market. In addition, despite broad public support for cannabis legalization in the United States, the growth of our business is dependent in part upon the continued authorization of cannabis in new jurisdictions, as well as the absence of legislation narrowing, limiting or repealing existing laws legalizing and regulating cannabis. Any one of these factors could slow or halt the legalization or consumer adoption of cannabis, which would negatively impact our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition to being subject to general business risks applicable to a business involving a technology product in a regulated industry, we need to continue to build brand awareness for the Leafly platform and make significant investments in our business strategy, including by introducing new services and platform features into the markets in which we operate, expanding our international presence and regulatory compliance efforts. These activities may not promote our services and platform features as effectively as intended, or at all, and we expect that our competitors will undertake similar investments to compete with us for market share.\nFurthermore, consolidation of the cannabis markets could reduce the size of our potential supplier base and give remaining suppliers greater bargaining or purchasing power. This may in turn erode the prices we are able to charge for our services and result in decreased margins. Competitive conditions, consumer preferences, supplier requirements and spending patterns in this new industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique circumstances that differ from other existing industries and markets. Those conditions may cause our efforts to further our business, including promoting our brand awareness, offering high quality services, and attracting and retaining suppliers and consumers, to be unsuccessful or to have undesired consequences that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may not be successful in our efforts to attract and retain customers or traffic, or to develop and commercialize new products, or these activities may require significantly more resources than anticipated in order to be successful.\nBecause our business is dependent, in part, upon continued market acceptance of cannabis by consumers, any negative trends could adversely affect our business operations.\nWe are dependent on public support, continued market acceptance and the proliferation of consumers in the state-level and Canadian legal cannabis markets. While we believe that the market and opportunities in the space will continue to grow, we cannot predict the future growth rate or size of the market. Any downturns in, or negative outlooks on, the cannabis industry may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nExpansion of our business is dependent on the continued and future legalization of cannabis.\nExpansion of our business is, in part, dependent upon continued and future legislative authorization, including by voter initiatives and referenda, of cannabis in various jurisdictions worldwide. Any number of factors could slow, halt, or even reverse progress in this area. For example, some ballot measures in 2020 were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, progress for the industry, while encouraging, is not assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action in a particular jurisdiction, numerous factors could impact the legislative process, including lobbying efforts by opposing stakeholders as well as legislators\u2019 disagreements about how to legalize cannabis as well as the interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of applicable laws or regulations. Any one of these factors could slow or halt the legalization of cannabis, which would negatively impact our ability to expand our business. Additionally, the expansion of our business also depends on jurisdictions in which cannabis is currently legalized not narrowing, limiting or repealing existing laws legalizing and regulating cannabis, or altering the regulatory landscape in a way that diminishes the viability of cannabis businesses in those jurisdictions. This result may negatively impact the viability and attractiveness of our service offerings going forward. If such challenges are successful in any jurisdictions that have legalized or are in the process of legalizing cannabis, our ability to expand our business would be negatively impacted.\nWe expect to face increased competition in the market.\nThe market for information, advertising and online ordering regarding cannabis products and suppliers is intensely competitive, characterized by low barriers to entry and is rapidly changing. With the emergence of new technologies and market entrants, competition is likely to intensify in the future. We face competition from media companies, including but not limited to direct competitors such as High Times, Wikileaf and Allbud; offline media companies and service providers; newspaper, television, and other media companies; advertising platforms such as Weedmaps, but also general two-sided markets such as Yelp and internet search engines such as Google; online marketplaces such as Weedmaps, Dutchie, Eaze,\niHeartJane; e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Shopify; various business services providers such as Springbig, Meadow, Leaflink, Growflow and Metrc; and traditional customer relationship management service providers such as SAP and Salesforce. Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, greater market share, large existing user bases, more favorable regulatory regimes due to disparities in the geographic distribution of customer bases, location of operations or other factors, and greater financial, technical and other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer services similar to ours at a lower price, develop different services and platform features to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or supplier requirements. In particular, if restrictions on cannabis advertising ease, major internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, may begin developing and marketing online advertising offerings directly to cannabis businesses, and many of our advertising partners and potential advertising partners may choose to purchase online advertising solutions from these competitors and may reduce their purchases of our advertising solutions. As the cannabis industry matures and the market increases, new competitors, business models and solutions are likely to emerge. We also compete with these companies for the attention of contributors and consumers, and may experience decreases in both if our competitors offer more compelling environments.\nMoreover, as the legalization of cannabis continues, cannabis businesses could experience consolidation as existing cannabis businesses seek to obtain greater market share, greater access to funding and resources and purchasing power and new entrants seek to establish a significant market presence. Consolidation of the cannabis markets could reduce the size of our potential supplier base and give remaining suppliers greater bargaining or purchasing power. This may in turn erode the prices for our advertising solutions and result in decreased margins. Consolidation could particularly affect smaller cannabis businesses, with whom we have historically conducted the majority of our business. Further, heightened competition between cannabis businesses could ultimately have a negative impact on the viability of individual market participants, which could reduce or eliminate their ability to purchase our services, including our advertising solutions.\nFor all of these reasons, we may be unable to maintain or grow the number of people who use our website and mobile application and the number of businesses that use our advertising solutions. Accordingly, we may face pressure to reduce the price of our advertising solutions, in which case our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be harmed.\nIf users do not value the quality and reliability of the reviews and other content that we display on our platform, they may stop or reduce the use of our services, which could adversely impact the growth of our business.\nOur success depends in part on the quality of the reviews and other content that we display on our platform, both original content as well as third-party submissions, including whether they are helpful, up-to-date, unbiased, relevant, unique and reliable. If users do not value the content on our platform, they may stop or reduce the use of our services, and traffic to our website and on our mobile application will decline. If our user traffic declines, our suppliers may stop or reduce their use of services or advertising solutions offered on our platform. As a result, our business could be negatively affected if we fail to obtain high quality content from our contributors, or if the content we display is perceived to be unhelpful, out-of-date, biased, irrelevant, not unique or unreliable. We must therefore ensure that our services and platform features are attractive to users, and invite them to contribute. In addition, users who contribute content to our platform may provide content to our competitors. If they do so, the value of our content may decline relative to other available services and platform features, and our business may be harmed.\nWhile we attempt to filter or remove content that may be offensive, biased, unreliable or otherwise unhelpful, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness or adequacy of these efforts. If we fail to filter or remove a significant amount of content that is biased, unreliable, or otherwise unhelpful, or if we mistakenly filter or remove a significant amount of valuable content, our reputation and brand may be harmed, users may stop using our products, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBecause we recognize most of the revenue from our advertising products over the term of an agreement, a significant downturn in our business may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue from sales of our advertising products over the terms of the applicable agreements, which are generally auto-renewing month-to-month agreements. As a result, a decline in new or renewed agreements in any one quarter may significantly impact our revenue, which may not be immediately reflected in our financial results. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022our ability to attract new advertising partners and retain existing advertising partners;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses;\n\u2022the effects of changes in search engine and app store placement and prominence;\n\u2022the effects of increased competition in our business;\n\u2022our ability to successfully expand in existing markets, enter new markets and manage our international expansion;\n\u2022the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending at local businesses and the level of advertising spending by local businesses;\n\u2022the ability of licensed cannabis markets to successfully grow and outcompete illegal cannabis markets;\n\u2022our ability to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and increase traffic to our website and mobile application;\n\u2022our ability to keep pace with changes in technology;\n\u2022the success of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims and related judgments or settlements;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022our ability to operate as a public company , which requires substantial management attention and additional costs;\n\u2022interruptions in service and any related impact on our reputation;\n\u2022the attraction and retention of qualified employees and key personnel;\n\u2022our ability to choose and effectively manage third party service providers;\n\u2022our ability to successfully manage any acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies;\n\u2022the impact of risks related to health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential governmental and other restrictions resulting therefrom;\n\u2022the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\n\u2022changes in consumer behavior with respect to local businesses;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our internal controls; and\n\u2022changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nOur typical practices as it relates to consumer safety and engagement on our platform may pose a risk to our relationships with advertising partners.\nWe base many of our decisions upon the interests of the consumers who use our platform. We believe that this approach has been essential to our success in increasing our user growth rate and engagement. Our approach of prioritizing consumer safety and engagement may negatively impact our relationships with our existing or prospective advertising partners. For\nexample, we typically refuse to remove legitimate negative reviews and ratings of products or businesses that advertise on our platform. Certain advertisers may therefore perceive us as an impediment to their success as a result of negative reviews and ratings. This practice could result in a loss of advertising partners, which in turn could harm our results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nWe have a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially as our costs increase.\nWe began operating in 2011 and have yet to generate a profit. We incurred a net loss of $12 million and $10 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to support platform feature development, expand our service offerings, expand our marketing and sales operations, improve and expand our technology infrastructure, hire additional employees, pursue strategic opportunities, meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our transition to and operation as a public company and otherwise support our operations and growth. In addition, we intend to add back in-person working space over time. As we continue to grow, we expect the aggregate amount of these expenses will also continue to grow.\nOur efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and the other risks described herein and other unknown events. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the growth of our future expenses and our ability to generate revenue. If we continue to incur losses in the future, any such future losses, together with the net losses and negative cash flows from operations incurred to date, will have an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 accumulated deficit and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business and the cannabis industry, as outlined herein, we are unable to accurately predict when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our Common Stock may decrease and our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations may be impaired. A decline in the value of Common Stock may also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we fail to maintain and expand our brand and retailer client base, our revenue and our business will be harmed.\nIn the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, substantially all of our revenue was generated by (a) the sale of advertising solutions, and (b) subscription listing fees. Our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to maintain and expand our brand and retailer client base. To do so, we must convince prospective advertising partners of the benefits of our advertising solutions, including providing additional information and context to those prospective advertisers who may not be familiar with our solutions (such as those in new markets). We must also convince existing and prospective advertising partners alike that our advertising solutions work to their benefit. Additionally, our policy to decline acceptance of advertising or listings from companies that cannot demonstrate proper licensure may cause us to limit our advertising base and forgo certain revenue opportunities. Failure to maintain and expand our advertising partner base could harm our business.\nOur advertising partners do not typically have long-term obligations to purchase our services. In addition, we rely heavily on the purchase of advertising solutions by small and medium-sized local businesses, which have historically experienced high failure rates and often have limited advertising budgets. As a result, we may experience attrition in our advertising partners in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including losses to lower priced competitors, perceptions that our advertising solutions are unnecessary or ineffective, decline in advertising budgets, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, closures and bankruptcies. We must continually add new advertising partners both to replace advertisers who choose not to renew their advertising, go out of business or otherwise fail to fulfill their advertising contracts with us, and to grow our business. Our advertising partners\u2019 decisions to renew depend on a number of factors, including the degree of satisfaction with our services and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. The ratings and reviews that our suppliers receive from our users, may also affect advertising decisions by current and prospective advertising partners. For instance, favorable ratings and reviews, on the one hand, could be perceived as obviating the need to advertise, and unfavorable ratings and reviews, on the other hand, could discourage businesses from advertising to an audience they perceive as hostile or cause them to form a negative opinion of our products and user base, which could discourage them from doing business with us. Furthermore, our internal teams may take down a supplier\u2019s information if it breaches our listing restrictions, which may also affect advertising decisions by current and prospective advertising partners. In addition, the growth rates for new consumers, number of paying suppliers and monthly revenue per suppliers have at times slowed and may similarly slow in the future, even if we continue to add clients and consumers on\nan absolute basis. If our advertising partners increase their rates of non-renewal, if we experience significant advertising partner attrition or contract breach, or if we are unable to attract new advertising partners in numbers greater than the number of advertising partners that we lose, our client base will decrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nIf we do not successfully develop and deploy new software, platform features or services to address the needs of our suppliers and consumers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success has been based on our ability to design software, platform features and services that address the needs of our suppliers and consumers. We spend substantial amounts of time and money researching and developing new technologies and enhanced versions of existing platform features to meet our suppliers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 and potential suppliers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rapidly evolving needs, including online order and reservation solutions. Additionally, as consumers and suppliers demand richer data integrations with other cannabis industry participants such as point-of-sale providers and loyalty service providers, third party technology integrations may become increasingly important. If we are unable to arrange or complete new integrations, or improve our existing integrations, we may lose market share to competitors. There is no assurance that our enhancements to our software, platform features or our new services or capabilities will be compelling to our consumers or gain market acceptance. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate supplier or consumer demand or if we fail to develop our software, platform features or services in a manner that satisfies supplier or consumer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing suppliers or consumers or increase demand for our services.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing service offerings could make our platforms obsolete or adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing that delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new platforms, platform features or capabilities, or cause errors to arise with our existing software. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that new platforms, platform features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by consumers or suppliers brought against us, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, the design and development of new platforms or new platform features and capabilities to our existing platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful. If consumers or suppliers do not widely adopt our new platforms, platform features, and capabilities, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to expand effectively into new markets, both domestically and abroad, our revenue and business will be adversely affected.\nWe intend to expand our operations into new markets, both domestically and internationally. In doing so, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter new markets successfully. Our expansion into new markets places us in competitive environments with which we may be unfamiliar and involves various risks, including, among others, the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, or at all. In attempting to establish a presence in new markets, we expect, as we have in the past, to incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as compliance with market-specific laws or regulations, gaining consumer and customer acceptance, and expanding our sales force and community management personnel to cover those new markets. Our current and any future expansion plans will require significant resources and management attention. Furthermore, we have already entered many of the largest existing markets in the United States and further expansion may not yield similar results or sustain our growth.\nWe may fail to offer the optimal pricing of our services.\nWe have limited experience in determining the optimal pricing of our services, and we may need to change our pricing model from time to time. For example, we charge different rates for the same services in different markets, based on a variety of factors such as the number of local retailers and consumer traffic and engagement. If our suppliers believe the cost of our services do not generate proper return on investment, such suppliers may decline to continue using our services, and our revenue and other financial results may be adversely impacted.\nOur international operations involve additional risks, and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand internationally.\nOur traffic is global, and we expect to expand our international operations by accessing new markets abroad and expanding our offerings in new languages. Our platform is primarily available only in English. We may have difficulty modifying our technology and content for use in non-English-speaking markets or fostering new communities in non-English-speaking markets. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires, and will require considerable and growing, management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. Furthermore, in most international markets, we would not be the first entrant, and our competitors may be better positioned than we are to succeed. Expanding internationally may subject us to risks that we have either not faced before or increase our exposure to risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n\u2022recruiting and retaining qualified, multi-lingual employees, including sales personnel;\n\u2022increased competition from local websites and guides and potential preferences by local populations for local providers;\n\u2022compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including different cannabis, privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations, different intellectual property laws and certain employment laws requiring national collective bargaining agreements that set minimum salaries, benefits, working conditions and termination requirements;\n\u2022providing services in different languages for different cultures, which may require that we modify our services and platform features to ensure that they are culturally relevant in different countries;\n\u2022the enforceability of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022increased travel, infrastructure and compliance costs associated with multiple foreign locations;\n\u2022compliance with anti-bribery laws, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022export controls and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n\u2022political and economic instability in some countries;\n\u2022double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u2022higher costs of doing business internationally.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our platform is accessible.\nIt is important to our success that users in all geographies be able to access our platform at all times. We have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, denial of service attacks, or fraud, ransomware or security attacks. We may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures or halt such attacks, and we cannot guarantee that applicable recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures are or will be adequate to prevent network and service interruption, system failure or data loss. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when users attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, users may seek other services to obtain the information for which\nthey are looking, and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract users, suppliers and advertising partners and increase engagement on our website and mobile application. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed. Furthermore, any actual or perceived distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, ransomware attack, security breach or other unauthorized access could damage our reputation and brand, result in decreased utilization of our platform, expose us to fines and penalties, government investigations, litigation, require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remediate the incident, and cause increased cybersecurity protection costs. For more information, see \u201cIf our security measures are compromised, or if our platform is subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our content, users may curtail or stop use of our platform\u201d and \u201cWe rely upon cloud-based data centers, infrastructure and technologies provided by third parties, and technology systems and electronic networks supplied and managed by third parties, to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these systems, technologies and networks may adversely affect our business and operating results\u201d below.\nWe are in the process of implementing a disaster recovery program, which will allow us to move our platform to a back-up data center in the event of a catastrophe. Although this program is partially functional, it does not provide a real time back-up data center, so if our primary data center shuts down, there will be a period of time that our platform will remain unavailable while the transition to the back-up data center takes place.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business.\nTo some extent, we rely on data about certain products or businesses from third parties, including their respective websites and third parties that license such information to us. We also rely on third parties for other aspects of our business, such as mapping functionality and administrative software and back office solutions. In the past three years, at least six third parties (including third parties in the ERP, payroll, HRIS, tax compliance, back office finance and SMS services fields) have terminated their relationship with us based on our involvement in the cannabis industry. Others with whom we may have desired to form a relationship have declined our requests on the same basis. If these third parties decline to work with us, provide inaccurate or incorrect information, experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, or our licenses are revoked or not renewed, it could make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business, which could damage our reputation. In addition, if such third party service providers were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, increase their fees or if our relationships with these providers deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide consumers and advertising partners with content or provide similar services until an equivalent provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations. Furthermore, if a sufficient number of third parties decline to work with us, we may have a limited number of third party service providers available to meet our business needs, which may limit our ability to negotiate favorable prices and terms. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in choosing or finding high-quality partners, if we fail to negotiate cost-effective relationships with them, or if we ineffectively manage these relationships, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nOur payment system and the payment systems of our suppliers depend on third-party providers and are subject to evolving laws and regulations.\nWe have engaged third-party service providers to perform credit and debit card processing services for supplier\u2019s payments to us. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate, our ability to process payments could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. Additionally, some of our suppliers use similar third-party providers for processing services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if the relationships of our suppliers with these service providers were to terminate the ability of our suppliers to process payments could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. The laws and regulations related to payments are complex and are potentially affected by tensions between federal and state treatment of the cannabis and other industries. These laws and regulations also vary across different jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to comply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities, or could force us to stop offering our suppliers the ability to pay with credit cards, debit cards and bank transfers. As we expand the availability of these payment methods or offer new payment methods to our suppliers in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements. Due to the constantly evolving and complex laws and regulations applicable to our industry, third-party merchant banks and third-party payment processors may consider our business a high risk. This could cause a third party to discontinue its\nservices to us, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement. If this were to occur, we would need to collect from our suppliers using less efficient methods, which could adversely impact our collections, revenues and financial performance. Additionally, if a third party were to discontinue its services to us or if the applicable laws and regulations were to evolve in a way that impacted us negatively, we may not be able to realize our plans of expanding our business offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our plans for expansion. For more information, see \u201c- Additional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry - Leafly\u2019s operations may be negatively affected by the way other private companies interpret laws and regulations applicable to the cannabis industry, or their policies and practices with respect to the cannabis industry,\u201d \u201c- We are dependent on our banking relations, and we may have difficulty accessing or consistently maintaining banking or other financial services due to our connection with the cannabis industry\u201d and \u201c- Risks Related to Leafly\u2019s Business and Industry - We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and any actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business\u201d below.\nFurther, through our agreement with our third-party credit card processors, we are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including restrictions on product mix and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI-DSS\u201d). We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Additionally, any data breach or failure to hold certain information in accordance with PCI-DSS may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe track certain performance metrics with internal tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe calculate and track performance metrics with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third-party. While we believe our metrics are reasonable estimates of our user or supplier base for the applicable period of measurement, the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and may be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. For example, user accounts are based on email addresses, and a user could use multiple email addresses to establish multiple accounts, and suppliers may have multiple accounts. As a result, the data we report may not be accurate. Our internal tools and processes we use to identify multiple accounts or fraudulent accounts have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking key metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including historical metrics. For more information regarding such metrics, see \u201cLeafly\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Metrics\u201d and \u201cLeafly\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other Metrics.\u201d Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments and we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed metrics for any such changes. Though we regularly review our processes for calculating metrics and may adjust our processes for calculating metrics to improve their accuracy, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer term strategies. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, user or supplier base, or traffic levels; if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics; or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, user or supplier base or traffic levels, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, our reputation may be harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur suppliers and investors rely on our key metrics as a representation of our performance. If these third parties do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or user engagement, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics, our investors could bring lawsuits against us, our reputation may be harmed and retailers may be less willing to list a business on our platform, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe traffic to our website and mobile application may decline and our business may suffer if other companies copy information from our platform and publish or aggregate it with other information for their own benefit.\nFrom time to time, other companies copy information from our platform, through website scraping, robots or other means, and publish or aggregate it with other information for their own benefit. While we aggressively enforce our copyrights, we have no assurance that other companies will not copy, publish or aggregate content from our platform.\nWe may not be able to detect such third party conduct in a timely manner and, even if we could, we may not be able to prevent it. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States and Canada, our available remedies may be inadequate to protect us against such practices due to a variety of potential issues, including uncertain common law protections, jurisdictional issues, lack of adequate remedies under applicable law and difficulty in\nidentifying potential defendants. In addition, we may be required to expend significant financial or other resources to successfully enforce our rights. When third parties copy, publish, or aggregate content from our platform, it makes them more competitive, and decreases the likelihood that consumers will visit our website or use our mobile application to find the information they seek, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our platform could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe update our platform on a frequent basis. Despite efforts to test our updates, we have discovered and expect we will continue to discover errors, failures and bugs in our platform and anticipate that certain of these errors, failures and bugs will only be discovered and remediated after deployment to suppliers. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity, security incidents, such as data breaches, government inquiries, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position, or claims by suppliers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for supplier relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.\nWe implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regular system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of inaccuracies in the data we collect for our suppliers, or unauthorized access or damage to, or the loss, acquisition, or inadvertent release or exposure of confidential or other sensitive data could cause our reputation to be harmed and result in claims against us, and cannabis businesses may elect not to purchase our products or, in the case of existing suppliers, renew their agreements with us or we may incur increased insurance costs. The costs associated with any material defects or errors in our software or other performance problems may be substantial and could harm our operating results and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, results of operations and business could be harmed.\nWe have recently experienced growth in our headcount and operations, which places substantial demands on management and our operational infrastructure. Most of our employees have been with us for fewer than two years. We intend to make substantial investments in our technology, sales and marketing and community management organizations. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in international markets, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brand, results of operations and business.\nWe rely on traffic to our website from search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing, as well as paid digital advertising and social media marketing. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our website could decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid internet search results on search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing. In total, search engines accounted for approximately 77% of the sessions on our platform during 2021. The number of users we attract to our website from search engines is due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or platform features or the services or platform features of one or more of our competitors. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website could adversely impact our business and results of operations, particularly if our competitors are permitted to engage in paid promotion.\nGoogle in particular is the most significant source of traffic to our website accounting for more than 75% of the search engine-generated sessions on our platform in 2021. Since Google does not allow us to engage in paid promotion of our website, we rely on organic prominence. Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain a prominent presence in search results for queries regarding local businesses on Google. Given the large volume of traffic to our website and the importance of the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, the continued inability to engage in paid promotion could have a substantial negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to place digital advertisements for the Leafly platform is constrained because certain large digital ad networks, such as those owned or operated by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Twitter, do not allow us to advertise. As a result, we are limited to digital ad placements on independently owned websites, such as certain local news websites.\nAdditionally, visits to Leafly could also decline if our accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter are shut down or restricted. We work across these social networks to increase brand awareness of our company by consumers and suppliers, and to promote the acquisition of brand and retailer clients. Our engagement on these social media platforms is subject to their respective terms of service and community guidelines, which generally restrict the promotion, sale and, often, depiction of cannabis. While we do not promote the sale of cannabis or cannabis-related products by our suppliers on these social media platforms, the perception that we may be engaging in such promotion or our inadvertent violation of other aspects of these platforms\u2019 terms of service or community guidelines may result in our accounts being shut down or restricted. Any such suspension or restriction could result in reduced traffic to our website and diminished demand for our services, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf our current marketing model is not effective in attracting new brand and retailer clients, we may need to employ higher-cost sales and marketing methods to attract and retain brand and retailer clients, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe use our sales team to build relationships with our supplier base. Our sales team builds and maintains relationships with suppliers primarily through phone and email contact, which is designed to allow us to cost-effectively service a large number of suppliers. We may need to employ more resource-intensive sales methods, such as increasing our enterprise or field sales teams, to continue to attract and retain brand and retailer clients, particularly as we increase the number of our brand and retailer clients and our supplier base employs more sophisticated marketing operations, strategies and processes. This could cause us to incur higher sales and marketing expenses, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMobile is an important component of our business, and it presents unique risks.\nOur mobile applications, including mobile web-based access, represents a significant portion of our user traffic. If we fail to deliver compelling platform features and services or effective advertising solutions, our business may suffer.\nWe have experienced challenges with Apple\u2019s AppStore and Google\u2019s Play Store with regard to the implementation of certain features in our iOS and Android applications, respectively. Historically, Apple did not permit us to deploy our \u201cPickup\u201d online order reservation features to users based in the United States, although Apple now allows consumers to pre-order through iOS applications. Apple has on occasion rejected application updates for various reasons, including the claimed basis that digital advertising for cannabis violates their Terms of Service. When necessary, we have implemented workarounds, including directing users to mobile web applications; however, these solutions are suboptimal, can be frustrating to users, and could hinder awareness or adoption of platform features or services which are important to our future growth. If we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our mobile application into mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as those of Apple or Google, or if our applications receive unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order of our products in the Apple AppStore or the Google Play app store, or if we face increased costs to distribute our mobile application, our future growth and our results of operations could suffer.\nWe rely upon cloud-based data centers, infrastructure and technologies provided by third parties, and technology systems and electronic networks supplied and managed by third parties, to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these systems, technologies and networks may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on data centers and other technologies and services provided by third parties in order to host our cloud-based infrastructure on which we operate our business. If any of these services becomes unavailable or otherwise is unable to serve our requirements due to extended outages, interruptions, or facility closure, or because it is no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our operations could be disrupted or otherwise impacted until appropriate substitute services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the data center facilities and infrastructure we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyberattack, terrorism and similar other events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, to adverse events caused by operator error, and to interruptions, data loss or corruption, and other performance problems due to various factors, including introductions of new capabilities, technology errors, infrastructure changes, DDoS attacks, or other security-related incidents and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for related losses that may occur. Changes in law or regulations applicable to data centers in\nvarious jurisdictions could also cause a disruption in service. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our platform operations and the loss, corruption of, unauthorized access to or acquisition of supplier or consumer data.\nOur platform also depends on our ability to communicate through the public internet and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties. In addition, in order to provide our solutions on-demand and promptly, our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours per day, which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by third parties and the availability of electricity, which we do not control. A severe disruption of one or more of these networks or facilities, including as a result of utility or third-party system interruptions, could impair our ability to process information and provide our solutions to our suppliers and consumers.\nAny unavailability of, or failure to meet our requirements by, third-party data centers or other third-party technologies or services, or any disruption of the internet, utilities or the third-party networks or facilities that we rely upon, could impede our ability to make our platform accessible, harm our reputation, result in reduced traffic from consumers, cause us to issue refunds or credits to our suppliers, and subject us to potential liabilities. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, reputation and operating results.\nWe face potential liability and expense for legal claims based on the content on our platform.\nWe provide educational information regarding the use and potential effects of various types of cannabis products through our platform, including information regarding potential therapeutic uses for cannabis. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies or perceived inaccuracies, it is possible that consumers or others may sue us for various causes of action. Although our website and mobile applications contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving. We could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers that provide the terms and conditions for use of our websites and mobile applications are unenforceable. A finding by a court that these agreements are invalid and that we are subject to liability could harm our business and require costly changes to our business.\nFor content that we publish or provide ourselves, we have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide. However, we cannot provide assurance that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, our business is based on establishing the reputation of our platform as trustworthy and dependable source of educational information. Allegations of impropriety or inaccuracy, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation and business.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for legal claims relating to the information that we publish on our website and mobile application, including claims for defamation, libel, negligence and copyright or trademark infringement, among others. For example, businesses in the past have claimed, and may in the future claim, that their search result display is arbitrary or improper, that we are responsible for third party infringement, that our editorial content is defamatory, or that we are responsible for defamatory reviews posted by our users.\nWe expect claims like these to continue, and these claims could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merits of the claims. In some instances, we may elect or be compelled to remove or re-order content or may be forced to pay substantial damages if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to defend against these claims. If we elect or are compelled to remove or re-order valuable content from our website or mobile application, our platform may become less useful to consumers and our traffic may decline, which could have a negative impact on our business and financial performance.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations or adversely affecting our ability to operate our business.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges and opportunities, including the need to develop new platform features and services or enhance our existing services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include equity conversion rights, covenants\nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, expending capital, pursuing certain business opportunities or declaring dividends. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Due to the current legal status of cannabis under U.S. federal law, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, difficulty attracting additional debt or equity financing. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, our business may be harmed, our stock price may fall, and you may lose your investment.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention from the business, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our service offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, user, supplier and advertising partner demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through acquisitions, mergers, partnerships, joint ventures or other strategic transactions with complementary businesses or technologies rather than through internal development. We have limited experience acquiring other businesses and technologies. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Furthermore, even if we successfully acquire additional businesses or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business or technology. In addition, we may inherit liabilities from future acquisitions that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If an acquired business or technology fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and in the future, we may identify additional material weaknesses or fail to maintain an effective system of controls. If we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and stock price.\nIn connection with the preparation and audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, a material weakness was identified in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness identified was a deficiency in the effectiveness of the review of accounting conclusions for complex debt and equity transactions. We remediated this material weakness during 2021 through the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer who has experience in complex derivative transactions and a Director of SEC Reporting with SEC reporting and technical accounting experience, as well as through the use of third-party consultants and specialists to supplement our internal resources.\nIn addition to remediating this specific material weakness, we have begun our implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley and continue to assess and further develop our internal controls and procedures. Our full Sarbanes-Oxley implementation is forecasted to be complete late in 2022. Costs associated with these internal control activities are discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our periodic filings with the SEC to the extent material to the discussion for the respective period, including in such discussion with respect to Leafly that is being filed substantially concurrently with the filing of this Annual Report on Amendment No. 1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, initially filed on February 10, 2022.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date and may take in the future will be sufficient to prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. If we are unable to prevent or avoid future material weaknesses, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the forms of the SEC, could be adversely affected which, in turn, may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, any such failures could result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, loss of investor confidence,\ndelisting of our securities, and harm to our reputation and financial condition, or diversion of financial and management resources from the operation of our business.\nIn addition, it is possible that control deficiencies could be identified by our management or by our independent registered public accounting firm in the future or may occur without being identified. Such a failure could result in regulatory scrutiny and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial results, lead to a default under our current or future indebtedness and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur business is dependent on U.S. state laws and regulations and Canadian federal and provincial laws and regulations pertaining to the cannabis industry.\nIn the United States, despite cannabis being legalized under state law in some form in many states and notwithstanding the federal government\u2019s tolerance of state legalization schema, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d). The CSA makes it a federal crime to grow, distribute, or sell cannabis in the United States, even in states in which medical or recreational cannabis has been legalized under state law. It is also illegal to advertise the sale of cannabis, or to use the internet to facilitate the sale of cannabis. It is also a federal crime to aid and abet another in growing, distributing, or selling cannabis, and it can be illegal to engage in certain transactions with those growing, distributing, or selling cannabis, if the goal of the transactions is to promote those activities or conceal that the source of the proceeds in the transaction came from those activities. We do not grow, distribute, or sell cannabis in the United States. Although we may engage in transactions with entities growing, distributing, or selling cannabis, we have no intent to promote criminal activity by our suppliers, and these transactions reflect only our desire to promote our own business operations. Accordingly, we believe that our activities do not violate the CSA as currently interpreted by U.S. courts. However, there is a risk that federal prosecutors may seek to apply those laws to us, that U.S. courts may change their interpretation of the CSA, and that violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations, such as the CSA, could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings initiated by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture.\nIn Canada, the Cannabis Act legalized the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis for medical and adult-use purposes in Canada and created a federal legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, promotion, sale and possession of cannabis. The Cannabis Act also provides the provinces and territories of Canada with the authority to regulate other aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution, sale, minimum age requirements (subject to the minimum set forth in the Cannabis Act), places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters. The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides that it is prohibited to publish, broadcast or otherwise disseminate, on behalf of another person, with or without consideration, any promotion that is prohibited by a number of sections of the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act therefore includes provisions that could apply to certain aspects of our business, both directly to the solutions we provide and indirectly on account of any noncompliance by those who use our offerings. However, as the Cannabis Act has been recently enacted, there is a lack of available interpretation, application and enforcement of the provisions that may be relevant to digital platforms such as ours, and as a result, it is difficult to assess our potential exposure under the Cannabis Act.\nLaws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry in U.S. states and Canada are continually changing. Any change in regulations or even the speed of changes to regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance, to alter our business plan or give rise to material liabilities, and could materially and adversely affect our operations, revenue, and profitability. The commercial cannabis industry is still a young industry, and we cannot predict the impact of the compliance regime to which our business may be subject. Although we have not yet been required to obtain any cannabis license as a result of existing cannabis regulations, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will require us to obtain such a license in order to provide our services in a particular jurisdiction or that will otherwise seek to substantially regulate our business and there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such licenses. These laws change frequently and may be difficult to interpret and apply. For example, the Florida Department of Health recently made a determination that licensed dispensaries\u2019 use of our online ordering reservation system violated the statutory requirement that no third parties be directly involved in dispensing cannabis. We filed a legal challenge alleging that the Department of Health wrongfully promulgated an un-adopted rule that erroneously interprets the statute and received a judgment in our favor (the \u201cFLDOH Matter\u201d), and our suppliers in Florida that previously ceased use of the online ordering feature still must obtain regulatory approval to resume using these features and, as a result, our business in Florida continues to be adversely affected. In October 2021, the administrative law\njudge issued a final order that the Florida Department of Health\u2019s policy of prohibiting online third-party pre-reservation services was in fact an unadopted rule. We have recently been made aware that the Florida Department of Health filed a notice of appeal with the First District Court of Appeal on November 17, 2021, which is still pending. In the event the Florida Department of Health promulgates a formal rule, which they have not done to date, our ability to conduct business in Florida may be materially impacted. Additionally, failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions on our operations.\nGiven the concentration of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to retailers to list their products, any increase in the stringency of any applicable laws, including U.S. state, or Canadian federal, provincial or territorial laws and regulations relating to cannabis, or any escalation in the enforcement of such existing laws and regulations against the cannabis industry within any jurisdiction, could negatively impact the profitability or viability of cannabis businesses in such affected jurisdictions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFor more information regarding risks the cannabis industry may present to our business, see the subsection entitled \u201c- Additional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry.\u201d\nFederal law enforcement may deem our suppliers to be in violation of U.S. federal law, in particular the CSA. An adverse change in U.S. federal policy on cannabis enforcement and strict enforcement of federal cannabis laws against our suppliers would undermine our business model and materially affect our business and operations.\nExcept in limited circumstances, U.S. federal law, and more specifically the CSA, proscribes the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis. It is also federally illegal to advertise the sale of cannabis, or to use the internet to facilitate the sale of cannabis. Although the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed hemp and hemp-derived cannabinoids from the definition of \u201cmarihuana\u201d in the CSA, and the Omnibus Spending bill (described below) protects state medical cannabis programs, cannabis remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the United States and is currently illegal under U.S. federal law. Even in those U.S. states in which the growing, processing, distribution, sale and use of cannabis has been legalized, these activities continue to violate U.S. federal law. Additionally, in 2018, a series of memoranda and guidance from 2009 to 2014 that generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to enforce federal cannabis laws against actors who were in compliance with state guidance were formally rescinded. Since U.S. federal laws criminalizing the use of cannabis pre-empt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding cannabis could limit our ability to do business in the United States. As a result, U.S. federal law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal or unauthorized production, distribution, promotion, sale, possession or use of cannabis, may seek to bring criminal actions against our suppliers under the CSA or other federal criminal laws. If our suppliers are found to be violating U.S. federal law relating to cannabis, they may be subject not only to criminal charges and convictions, but also to forfeiture of property, significant fines and penalties, disgorgement of profits, administrative sanctions, cessation of business activities, or civil liabilities arising from proceedings initiated by either the U.S. government or private citizens. Any of these actions or consequences to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, or could force us to cease operations, and as a result, our investors could lose their entire investment.\nFurther, to the extent any law enforcement actions require us to respond to subpoenas, or undergo search warrants, including for supplier records, cannabis businesses could elect to cease using our products. Until the U.S. federal government changes the laws with respect to cannabis, and particularly if the U.S. Congress does not extend the Omnibus Spending Bill\u2019s protection of state medical cannabis programs (described below) to apply to all state cannabis programs, U.S. federal authorities could more strictly enforce current federal prohibitions and restrictions. An increase in federal enforcement against companies licensed under state cannabis laws could negatively impact the state cannabis industries and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation.\nFor more information regarding risks the cannabis industry may present to our business, see the subsection entitled \u201c- Additional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry.\u201d\nThe laws and regulations regarding hemp-derived products are unsettled, and an adverse change in U.S. federal policy towards our suppliers would materially affect our business and operations.\nSome of our suppliers sell products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids, including CBD and certain forms of THC (including but not limited to delta-8 THC). Until recently, hemp and hemp extracts (except mature stalks, fiber produced from the stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds and any other compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture or preparation of such parts) were classified by the federal government as \u201cmarihuana\u201d under the CSA. The Agricultural Act of 2014, Pub. L. 113-79 (the \u201c2014 Farm Bill\u201d) and the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334 (the \u201c2018 Farm Bill\u201d), altered hemp\u2019s status, such that currently hemp (which must, by definition, contain less than 0.3% delta-9\nTHC on a dry weight basis) and hemp extracts, including CBD, are no longer defined as \u201cmarihuana\u201d nor classified as a controlled substance.\nMany states have revised their own laws to make hemp and hemp derivatives legal. These laws generally impose licensing and regulatory requirements for the cultivation, processing, transportation, or distribution of hemp and hemp products. Many states also impose restrictions on the type of products that may be sold, including prohibiting the sale of certain hemp or CBD products, such as ingestible products or smokable hemp, or limiting the manner in which they may be sold by, for example, prohibiting health claims in advertising. States could change their laws and make the requirements to grow, process, transport, and distribute hemp and hemp products more difficult. States could also investigate whether or determine that our suppliers were found to be operating in violation of state law. Any of these actions or consequences to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) claims that the Food, Drugs & Cosmetics Act significantly limits the legality of hemp-derived CBD products and the manner in which hemp-derived CBD products may be marketed and sold. In addition, we do not believe that any of our suppliers\u2019 claims about the legality of hemp-derived THC products have been tested in court. If our suppliers are found to be violating U.S. federal law relating to hemp-derived products, they may be subject not only to criminal charges and convictions, but also to forfeiture of property, significant fines and penalties, disgorgement of profits, administrative sanctions, cessation of business activities, or civil liabilities arising from proceedings initiated by either the U.S. government or private citizens. Any of these actions or consequences to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAllowing unlicensed or noncompliant businesses to access our services, allowing businesses to use our services in a noncompliant manner, including engaging in false or deceptive business practices, may subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and/or negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation.\nOur suppliers are contractually required to represent, warrant and covenant to us that they conduct their business in compliance with applicable state law, which includes any applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each state or province in which they do business. Suppliers further contractually agree to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their noncompliance, and there is no guarantee that such suppliers will be able to fulfill such indemnification obligations. We rely on our suppliers\u2019 contractual representations, and generally do not verify them, other than with respect to the licensed status of our suppliers operating cannabis retail and brands (i.e., product) businesses. We require suppliers to provide proof of valid corporate existence at the time we initially onboard them, or, if we understand that state law requires a separate cannabis license, to submit a valid, unexpired state-issued license number. We do not routinely validate whether that license number remains valid during the term of our suppliers\u2019 use of our services. As a result, some of our suppliers or their listings currently and in the future may not be in compliance with licensing and related requirements under applicable state or provincial laws and regulations. Any potential legal enforcement actions against any of our suppliers selling cannabis for being unlicensed or insufficiently licensed could negatively impact us.\nAny legal or regulatory enforcement against us based on the business solutions that we offer, the third-party content available on our platform or noncompliance by our suppliers with licensing and other legal requirements, could subject us to various risks, including monetary penalties and the risk that we elect or are compelled to remove content from our platform and would likely cause us to experience negative publicity. Any of these developments could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand, and reputation.\nWe generally do not, and cannot, ensure that our suppliers will conduct their business activities in a manner compliant with regulations and requirements applicable to the cannabis industry. As a result, federal, state, provincial or local government authorities may seek to bring criminal, administrative or regulatory enforcement actions against our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial conditions, or could force us to cease operations.\nWe offer features and services on our platform to support our suppliers\u2019 compliance with certain regulations and other legal requirements applicable to the cannabis industry, such as (a) collecting medical marijuana cardholder information to assist dispensaries with their verification obligations, (b) age-gating in accordance with applicable state regulations, (c) reviewing cannabis license information for operational cannabis suppliers, both on submission and on a periodic ongoing basis, to ensure validity and accuracy and (d) requiring operational cannabis suppliers, including storefronts and delivery services, to provide a valid, unexpired state-issued license number before accepting their listings or advertisements on our platform. However, we generally do not, and cannot, ensure that our suppliers will conduct their business activities in a manner compliant with such regulations and requirements, in whole or in part. Their legal noncompliance could result in regulatory\nand even criminal actions against them, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business and operating results or financial condition, and as a result, our investors could lose their entire investment.\nFor additional information, see the other risk factors in this subsection entitled \u201c- Risks Related to Leafly\u2019s Business and Industry,\u201d including \u201c- Some of our suppliers or their listings currently and in the future may not be in compliance with licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations. Allowing unlicensed or noncompliant businesses to access our products, or allowing businesses to use our solutions in a noncompliant manner, may subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation. In addition, allowing businesses who engage in false or deceptive advertising practices to use our solutions may subject us to negative publicity, which could have similar adverse impacts on us.\u201d Additionally, please see the subsection entitled \u201c- Additional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry.\u201d\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and any actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental authorities, including those responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, anti-bribery laws, lobbying and election laws, securities laws and tax laws. These laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus we must continue to monitor and dedicate resources to ensure continued compliance.\nIn addition, our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and foreign governmental agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Numerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information that may impact our business, potentially including state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches); federal and state consumer protection and employment laws, and European and other foreign data protection laws.\nWe receive, store, process, and use personal information and other user content. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide, including in the United States, is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, as many new laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), and other data have been adopted or are under consideration and existing laws and regulations may be subject to new and changing interpretations. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of data. In addition, although we do not believe we are subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), we are aware that at least one state regulator has taken the position that HIPAA does apply to some of our suppliers. In the event we become subject to HIPAA, our costs related to PII would increase.\nMany foreign countries and governmental bodies, including Canada and the European Union, or E.U., and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, internet protocol addresses and other types of data. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its implementing regulations, as amended (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes data privacy rights for consumers and compliance requirements for businesses doing business in California. Moreover, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act, (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), in November 2020. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, creating obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. In Canada, the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (the \u201cPIPEDA\u201d) governs the collection, use and disclosure of PII in many provinces in Canada, and though it is silent with respect to territorial reach, the Federal Court of Canada has found that PIPEDA will apply to businesses established in other jurisdictions if there is a \u201creal and substantial connection\u201d between the organization\u2019s activities and Canada. Provincial privacy commissioners take a similar approach to the interpretation and application of provincial private-sector privacy laws equivalent to PIPEDA. Further, Canada has robust anti-spam legislation. Organizations sending commercial electronic messages to individuals must either have express consent from the individual in the prescribed form or the situation must qualify as an instance of implied consent or other authorization set out in Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation (the \u201cCASL\u201d). The penalties for non-compliance under CASL are significant and the regulator, the Canadian Radio- Television and Telecommunications Commission, is active with respect to enforcement. In addition, the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, requires subject companies to implement and maintain comprehensive information privacy and\nsecurity protections with respect to personal data (data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual) about persons in the E.U. that is collected or processed by such companies. The GDPR provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state, provincial and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, governmental standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our applications or platform. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our contractors to comply with federal, state, provincial or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in loss of, unauthorized access to, or acquisition, alteration, destruction, release or transfer of PII or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause employees, suppliers and consumers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any inability or perceived inability (even if unfounded) on our part to adequately address privacy, data protection, and information security concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, governmental standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, Canada, the E.U. and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, or amendments or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, could impair our or our suppliers\u2019 ability to collect, use, disclose or otherwise process information relating to employees or consumers, which could decrease demand for our applications, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our supplier and consumer bases and increase revenue. Such laws and regulations may require us to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use PII or other data for certain purposes. In addition, a foreign government could require that any data collected in a country not be transferred or disseminated outside of that country, or impose restrictions or conditions upon such dissemination, and we may face difficulty in complying with any such requirements for certain geographic regions. Indeed, many privacy laws, such as those in force in Canada and the E.U., already impose these requirements. If we fail to comply with federal, state, provincial and foreign data privacy laws and regulations, our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals could be harmed. Furthermore, due to our acceptance of credit cards, we are subject to the PCI-DSS, which is designed to protect the information of credit card users.\nWe have had security incidents in the past, which we do not believe reached the level of a breach that would be reportable under applicable state laws or our other obligations; however, there can be no assurance that our determinations were correct. In the event our determinations are challenged and found to have been incorrect, we may be subject to unfavorable publicity or claims by one or more state attorneys general, federal regulators, or private plaintiffs, any of which could damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.\nOur business could suffer if the jurisdictions in which we operate change the way in which they regulate the internet, including regulations relating to user-generated content and privacy.\nGovernments may adopt laws and regulations that make it more difficult to operate our business, both domestically and abroad. We are subject to a number of data privacy and internet-related laws and regulations which result in significant compliance burdens. For example, we have settled two claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201dADA\u201d) that obligated us to make our websites WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliant for users with visual or other impairments. We are currently in the process of making updates to our website to fulfill this obligation. In addition, some legislators have called for increased regulation of the use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including certain targeted advertising practices. Others have called for changes affecting the immunities afforded to websites that publish user-generated content.\nOur business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted, or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that requires changes to these practices or the design of our website, products or features. In particular, the success of our business has depended, and we expect will continue to depend, on our ability to use the content and other information that our users share with us. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of the content that our users share through our website and mobile\napplication. Such changes may require us to modify our service offerings and platform features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to make use of the content and other information that our users generate on our website and mobile application.\nOur business and operating results may be harmed if we are deemed responsible for the collection and remittance of state sales taxes or other indirect taxes for suppliers using our order functionality.\nWe do not collect sales and value-added tax as part of our supplier agreements in the United States or Canada, based on our determination that such tax is not applicable to our platform. Sales and use, value-added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. We may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain states or jurisdictions. It is possible that one or more states could seek to impose sales, use or other tax obligations on us with regard to the ordering functionality that we offer our suppliers. These taxes may be applicable to past sales. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair that a U.S. state may require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax on sales to the state\u2019s residents may permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements, which may increase the jurisdictions in which we may be required to collect and/or remit taxes. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use or other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states or other jurisdictions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and additional administrative expenses and increase the cost of our products and solutions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur international footprint may subject us to potential adverse tax consequences in various jurisdictions.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, subjects us to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, which are subject to interpretation. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations and compliance in multiple jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or operating results.\nWe are subject to the income and transaction related tax laws primarily in the United States and Canada. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our U.S. and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and foreign business operations, and our business and financial performance. In addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances, such as Section 280E of the Code, discussed below, could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. Furthermore, changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings. The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or operating results. For more information see the subsection entitled \u201c- Additional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry - Cannabis businesses are subject to unfavorable U.S. tax treatment\u201d and \u201c- Service providers to cannabis businesses may also be subject to unfavorable U.S. tax treatment.\u201d\nRequirements as to taxation vary substantially among jurisdictions. Complying with the tax laws of these jurisdictions can be time consuming and expensive and could potentially subject us to penalties and fees in the future if we were to inadvertently fail to comply. If we were to inadvertently fail to comply with applicable tax laws, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards or other factors could negatively impact our future effective tax rate.\nOur future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for equity-based compensation, the impact of accounting for business combinations, changes in our international organization, and changes in overall levels of income before tax. In addition, in the ordinary course of our global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where income and tax determinations due by jurisdiction is uncertain.\nAdditional Risks Related to the Cannabis Industry\nCannabis remains illegal under federal law and, therefore, strict enforcement of federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to execute our business plan.\nCannabis, other than hemp (defined by federal law as Cannabis sativa L. with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis), is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Even in states or territories that have legalized cannabis to some extent, the cultivation, possession, and sale of cannabis all violate the CSA and are punishable by imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they aid and abet another in violating the CSA, or conspire with another to violate the law, and violating the CSA is a predicate for certain other crimes, including money laundering laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government has the authority to regulate and criminalize the sale, possession and use of cannabis, even for individual medical purposes, regardless of whether it is legal under state law.\nFor over eight years, under a policy instituted during President Obama\u2019s time in office, the U.S. government has not prioritized the enforcement of those laws against cannabis companies complying with state law and their vendors. On August 29, 2013 former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole issued a Memorandum (the \u201cCole Memo\u201d), which described the criminal enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions against those complying with state cannabis regulatory systems as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial resources. The Cole Memo gave federal prosecutors discretion not to prosecute state law compliant cannabis companies in states that were regulating cannabis, unless one or more of eight federal priorities were implicated, including use of cannabis by minors, violence, or the use of federal lands for cultivation. On January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the \u201cSessions Memo\u201d) rescinding the Cole Memo. The Sessions Memo, which remains in effect, states that each U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office should follow established principles that govern all federal prosecutions when deciding which cannabis activities to prosecute. As a result, federal prosecutors could and still can use their prosecutorial discretion to decide to prosecute even state-legal cannabis activities. Since the Sessions Memo was issued nearly three years ago, however, U.S. Attorneys have generally not prioritized the targeting of state law compliant entities. We cannot assure that each U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in each judicial district where we operate will not choose to enforce federal laws governing cannabis sales against state-legal companies such as our business suppliers.\nSince 2014, versions of the U.S. Omnibus Spending bill have included a provision prohibiting the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. In USA vs. McIntosh, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. The court noted that, if the spending bill provision were not continued, prosecutors could enforce against conduct occurring during the statute of limitations even while the provision was previously in force. Other courts that have considered the issue have ruled similarly, although courts disagree about which party bears the burden of proof of showing compliance or noncompliance with state law. Our policies do not prohibit our state-licensed cannabis retailers from engaging in the cannabis business for adult use that is permissible under state and local laws. Consequently, certain of our retailers currently (and may in the future) sell adult-use cannabis, if permitted by such state and local laws now or in the future, and therefore may be outside any protections extended to medical-use cannabis under the spending bill provision. This could subject our suppliers to greater and/or different federal legal and other risks as compared to businesses where cannabis is sold exclusively for medical use, which could in turn materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, any change in the federal government\u2019s enforcement posture with respect to state-licensed cannabis sales, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial districts where we operate, could result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant losses with respect to supplier base, which would adversely affect our operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nAlthough the U.S. Attorney General could issue policy guidance to federal prosecutors that they should not interfere with cannabis businesses operating in compliance with states\u2019 laws, any such guidance would not have the force of law, and could not be enforced by the courts. The President alone cannot legalize medical cannabis, and as states have demonstrated, legalizing medical cannabis can take many different forms. While rescheduling cannabis to the CSA\u2019s Schedule II would ease certain research restrictions, it would not make the state medical or adult-use programs federally legal.\nDuring his confirmation hearing, current Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that he did not see enforcement of federal cannabis law as a high priority use of resources for the DOJ: \u201cThis is a question of the prioritization of our resources and prosecutorial discretion. It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a useful use. I do think we need to be sure there are no end-runs around the state laws that criminal enterprises are doing. So that kind of enforcement should be continued. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of our resources, where states\nhave already authorized. That only confuses people, obviously, within the state.\u201d While the statement is not a promise to avoid federal interference with state cannabis laws, it does signal that the enforcement priorities of DOJ lie elsewhere.\nIndustry observers are hopeful that the various legislative proposals pending in Congress will increase the chances of federal cannabis policy reform. Numerous bills have attracted attention, including the States Reform Act, introduced by Republican members of Congress, as well as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the \u201cMORE Act\u201d), which was originally co-sponsored by now Vice President Harris in the Senate, and the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (the \"SAFE Act\"), which passed the House of Representatives in April 2021 but has not yet passed the Senate. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer also has proposed draft legislation that would legalize cannabis at the federal level (the \u201cCannabis Administration and Opportunity Act\u201d). However, we cannot provide assurances about the content, timing or chances of passage of a bill legalizing cannabis or liberalizing cannabis regulations. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing of any change in federal law or possible changes in federal enforcement. In the event that the federal government were to reverse its long-standing hands-off approach to the state legal cannabis markets and start more broadly enforcing federal law regarding cannabis, we would likely be unable to execute our business plan, and our business and financial results would be adversely affected.\nOur business and our suppliers are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws regarding financial transactions related to cannabis, which could subject our suppliers to legal claims or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe and our suppliers are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere that prohibit money laundering, including the Money Laundering Control Act (United States), as amended, and the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), and the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States, Canada or any other jurisdiction in which we have business operations. Violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering laws require proceeds from enumerated criminal activity, which includes trafficking in cannabis in violation of the CSA. Although we believe that none of our activities implicate the aforementioned money laundering statutes, largely because we believe there is no underlying CSA offense, in the event that any of our business activities, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing thereby are found to be in violation of money laundering statutes, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation, and any persons, including such U.S. based investors, found to be aiding and abetting us in such violations could be subject to liability. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees. We could also suffer significant penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures.\nOur operations may be negatively affected by the way other private companies interpret laws and regulations applicable to the cannabis industry, or their policies and practices with respect to the cannabis industry.\nIn most jurisdictions which legalized cannabis for adult or medical use, the cannabis industry is subject to a complex and comprehensive set of laws and regulations. Many entities that do business with consumers or suppliers in the cannabis industry institute internal or supplier-facing policies that limit or restrict how they do business with these suppliers, or take steps to verify that their suppliers in the cannabis industry operate in compliance with applicable laws. For example, some financial institutions that service cannabis retailers screen their clients\u2019 advertising for compliance with restrictions on cannabis advertising. Some financial institutions have interpreted editorial information that Leafly appends to some product pages within dispensary menus as advertising by those cannabis retailers, and instructed the suppliers to remove such advertising. Some mass media outlets have refused to publish advertisements for Leafly on the basis of perceived risk. The manner in which other companies interpret laws and regulations applicable to the cannabis industry, and the policies they institute as a result may adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 operations, which in turn could harm our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our banking relationships, and we may have difficulty accessing or consistently maintaining banking or other financial services due to our connection with the cannabis industry.\nAlthough we do not grow or sell cannabis products, our general connection with the cannabis industry may hamper our efforts to do business or establish collaborative relationships with others that may fear disruption or increased regulatory scrutiny of their own activities.\nWe are dependent on the banking industry to support the financial functions of our services and advertising solutions. Our business operating functions including payroll for our employees, real estate leases, and other expenses are handled reliant on traditional banking. Additionally, many of our suppliers pay us via wire transfer to our bank accounts, or via checks that we deposit into our banks. We require access to banking services for both us and our suppliers to receive payments in a timely manner. Lastly, to the extent we rely on any lines of credit, these could be affected by our relationships with\nfinancial institutions and could be jeopardized if we lose access to a bank account. Important components of our offerings depend on supplier accounts and relationships, which in turn depend on banking functions. Most federal and federally-insured state banks currently do not serve businesses that grow and sell cannabis products on the stated ground that growing and selling cannabis is illegal under federal law, even though the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), issued guidelines to banks in February 2014 that clarified how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses, consistent with financial institutions\u2019 obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. While the federal government has generally not initiated financial crimes prosecutions against state-law compliant cannabis companies or their vendors, the government has the ability to do so, at minimum against companies in the adult-use markets. The continued uncertainty surrounding financial transactions related to cannabis activities and the subsequent risks this uncertainty presents to financial institutions may result in their discontinuing services to the cannabis industry or limit their ability to provide services to the cannabis industry or ancillary businesses providing services to the cannabis industry.\nAs a result of federal-level illegality and the risk that providing services to state-licensed cannabis businesses poses to banks, cannabis-related businesses face difficulties accessing banks that will provide services to them. When cannabis businesses are able to find a bank that will provide services, they face extensive client due diligence in light of complex state regulatory requirements and guidance from FinCEN, and these reviews may be time-consuming and costly, potentially creating additional barriers to financial services for, and imposing additional compliance requirements on, us and our suppliers. FinCEN requires a party in trade or business to file with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), a Form 8300 report within 15 days of receiving a cash payment of over $10,000. While we receive very few cash payments for the products we sell, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that our strategies and techniques for designing our platform features and services, including our advertising solutions, for our suppliers will operate effectively and efficiently and not be adversely impacted by any refusal or reluctance of banks to serve businesses that grow and sell cannabis products. A change in banking regulations or a change in the position of the banking industry that permits banks to serve businesses that grow and sell cannabis products may increase competition for us, facilitate new entrants into the industry offering platform features and services similar to those that we offer, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Also, the inability of potential suppliers in our target market to open accounts and otherwise use the services of banks or other financial institutions may make it difficult for us to conduct business, including receiving payments in a timely manner.\nWe do not sell cannabis, or products that contain cannabis; accordingly, our company is not part of the cannabis industry that would be restricted from using federal and federally insured banks. However, because our revenue is generated largely from companies licensed as operators in the cannabis industry, banks have and may continue to consider us to be part of the cannabis industry that is subject to banking restrictions. If we were to lose any of our banking relationships or fail to secure additional banking relationships in the future, we could experience difficulty and incur increased costs in the administration of our business, paying our employees, accepting payments from suppliers, each of which may adversely affect our reputation or results of operations. Additionally, the closure of many or one of our bank accounts due to a bank\u2019s reluctance to provide services to a business working with state legal cannabis businesses would require significant management attention from us and could materially adversely affect our business and operations. In addition to banks and financial institutions, merchant processors may take a similar view of the risks of working with us since we provide services to cannabis businesses, and loss of any of our merchant processor relationships could have similar results. Moreover, Visa reportedly prohibits processing of transactions involving cannabis on its network, and Mastercard has reportedly stated that it is evaluating the inconsistency between U.S. state and federal cannabis law. Although U.S. consumers cannot purchase products on our listings marketplace and we do not currently use, nor have we historically used, any of our merchant processing relationships to process payments for cannabis transactions, to the extent Visa or Mastercard extend these restrictions to cannabis-related businesses, our merchant processing relationships could be terminated, or we could be prevented from processing any Visa or Mastercard transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe continuing proliferation of unlicensed and illicit cannabis operations may negatively affect our suppliers and our operations.\nWe exclusively offer our services for suppliers licensed under applicable state cannabis laws. Even in those states which have legalized cannabis for medical or adult use, unlicensed and illicit cannabis operations may continue to operate and compete against licensed businesses. This illicit competition may adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 operations, which in turn could harm our results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty using bankruptcy courts due to our involvement in the regulated cannabis industry.\nWe currently have no need or plans to seek bankruptcy protection. U.S. courts have held that debtors whose income is derived from cannabis or cannabis assets in violation of the CSA cannot seek federal bankruptcy protections. Although we are not in the business of growing or processing cannabis or selling or even possessing cannabis or cannabis products, a U.S. court could determine that our revenue is derived from cannabis or cannabis assets and prevent us from obtaining bankruptcy protections if necessary.\nThe conduct of third parties may jeopardize our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our systems, protocols, and practices will prevent all unauthorized or illegal activities by our suppliers. Our success depends in part on our suppliers\u2019 ability to operate consistently with the regulatory and licensing requirements of each state, local, and regional jurisdiction in which they operate. We have a dedicated catalog and compliance team that reviews cannabis license information for operational cannabis suppliers, both on submission and on an ongoing basis, to ensure validity and accuracy. We require all operational cannabis suppliers, including storefronts and delivery services, to provide a valid, unexpired state-issued license number before accepting their listings or advertisements on our platform. For certain of our products or services, we request additional verification and documentation. We cannot ensure that the conduct of our suppliers, who are third parties, and their actions could expose them to legal sanctions and costs, which would in turn, adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe conduct of third parties may jeopardize our regulatory compliance.\nWhile we are a technology company, not a cannabis licensee, and as such, are not subject to commercial cannabis regulations that apply to cannabis operators, we cannot guarantee that our systems, protocols, and practices will prevent any and all unauthorized or illegal activities by our suppliers. Our success depends in part on our suppliers\u2019 ability to operate consistently with the regulatory and licensing requirements of each state, local, and regional jurisdiction in which they operate. Despite the procedures and protocols in place for license verification by our catalog and compliance team, any non-compliance by our suppliers could put our business at risk, as discussed herein, and could also subject us to potential actions by state regulators, to the extent they could be applied to technology service providers, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, brand, and reputation.\nWe believe that Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act (the \u201cCDA\u201d) provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability, but it is possible that it does not.\nWe believe that Section 230(c)(1) of the CDA provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability to providers of interactive computer services in the United States, such as us, for content provided on their platforms that they did not create or develop. Section 230 does not provide any protections against federal criminal liability, such as prosecutions under the CSA. We do not create or develop the information that appears on our suppliers\u2019 listing pages and advertising placements, although our internal teams may take down a supplier\u2019s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). We do author and edit certain original content that appears in other sections of our placements, although our internal teams may take down a supplier\u2019s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). We do author and edit certain original content that appears in other sections of our site, such as Strains, Learn, News, Cannabis 101. All of these sections are general news and information, and none of these sections are advertisements for, or listing pages of, cannabis businesses. For additional information about Section 230 of the CDA, see the section entitled \u201c- Risks Related to Leafly\u2019s Business and Industry.\u201d Our suppliers are subject to licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations, and our own compliance policies, and some of our suppliers currently and in the future may not be in compliance with all such requirements. Despite our belief that we are protected by Section 230 of the CDA, it is possible that we are not, which would subject us to legal, business, and operational risks. In addition, there have been various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the CDA, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, recently enacted legislation in Germany may impose significant fines for failure to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations.\nWe may continue to be subject to constraints on marketing our products.\nCertain states in which we operate have enacted strict regulations regarding marketing and sales activities of cannabis products, including certain state restrictions on the use of our online order reservation platform, which could affect our cannabis retail suppliers\u2019 demand for our listing and marketing services. There may be restrictions on sales and marketing activities of cannabis businesses imposed by government regulatory bodies that can hinder the development of our business and operating results because of the restrictions our suppliers face. If our suppliers are unable to effectively use our products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed by our suppliers, this could hamper demand for our products and services from licensed cannabis retailers, which could result in a loss of revenue.\nCannabis businesses are subject to unfavorable U.S. tax treatment, which reduces our clients\u2019 profitability and could result in decreased demand for our services.\nSection 280E of the Code does not allow any deduction or credit for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on business, other than costs of goods sold, if the business (or the activities which comprise the trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedules I and II of the CSA). The IRS has applied this provision to cannabis operations, prohibiting them from deducting expenses associated with cannabis businesses beyond costs of goods sold and asserting assessments and penalties for additional taxes owed. Section 280E of the Code may have a lesser impact on cannabis cultivation and manufacturing operations than on sales operations, which directly affects our suppliers, who are cannabis retailers and brands. However, Section 280E of the Code and related IRS enforcement activity have had a significant impact on the operations of all cannabis companies. While the Section does not directly affect our Company, it lowers our suppliers\u2019 profitability, and could result in decreased demand or higher price sensitivity for our listing and marketing services. An otherwise profitable cannabis business may operate at a loss after taking into account its U.S. income tax expenses. This affects us because our sales and operating results could be adversely affected if our suppliers decrease their marketing budgets and are operating on lower profit margins as a result of unfavorable treatment by the Code.\nService providers to cannabis businesses may also be subject to unfavorable U.S. tax treatment.\nAs discussed above, under Section 280E of the Code, no deduction or credit is allowed for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on business, other than costs of goods sold, if the business (or the activities which comprise the trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedules I and II of the CSA). The IRS has applied this provision to cannabis operations, prohibiting them from deducting expenses associated with cannabis businesses and asserting assessments and penalties for additional taxes owed. While we do believe that Section 280E of the Code does not apply to our business, or ancillary service providers that work with state-licensed cannabis businesses, if the IRS interprets the Section to apply, it would significantly and materially affect our profitability and financial condition.\nCannabis businesses may be subject to civil asset forfeiture.\nAny property owned by participants in the cannabis industry used in the course of conducting such business, or that represents proceeds of such business or is traceable to proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by federal law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture because of the illegality of the cannabis industry under federal law. Even if the owner of the property is never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. Forfeiture of assets of our cannabis business clients could adversely affect our revenues if it impedes their profitability or operations and our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue to subscribe to our services.\nDue to our involvement in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate our business, which may expose us to additional risk and financial liability.\nInsurance that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, is more difficult for us to find and is more expensive or contains significant exclusions because our suppliers are cannabis industry participants. There are no guarantees that we will be able to find such insurance coverage in the future or that the cost will be affordable to us. If we are forced to go without such insurance coverage, it may prevent us from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit our growth, may limit our ability to attract directors and officers and may expose us to additional risk and financial liabilities. If we experience an uninsured loss, it may result in loss of anticipated cash flow and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and business.\nThere may be difficulty enforcing certain of our commercial agreements and contracts.\nCourts will not enforce a contract deemed to involve a violation of law or public policy. Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, parties to contracts involving the state legal cannabis industry have argued that the agreement was void as federally illegal or against public policy. Some courts have accepted this argument in certain cases, usually with adverse results for cannabis companies. While courts have enforced contracts related to activities by state-legal cannabis companies, and the trend is generally to enforce contracts with state-legal cannabis companies and their vendors, there remains doubt and uncertainty that we will be able to enforce our commercial agreements in court for this reason. We cannot be assured that we will have a remedy for breach of contract, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain of our directors, officers, employees and investors who are not U.S. citizens may face constraints on cross-border travel into the United States.\nBecause cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, non-U.S. citizens employed at or investing in companies doing business in the state legal cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with cannabis businesses. Entry to the United States for non-citizens happens at the sole discretion of the officers on duty of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the \u201cCBP\u201d), and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. CBP has taken the position that business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in Canada or in the United States is grounds for U.S. border guards to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada\u2019s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of U.S. laws regarding controlled substances and because cannabis continues to be a controlled substance under U.S. federal law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or in Canada may affect admissibility to the United States. CBP updated its stated policy on October 9, 2018 to clarify that a Canadian citizen coming to the United States for reasons unrelated to the cannabis industry will generally be admissible to the United States.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to disputes and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights. These disputes may be costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe currently face, and we expect to face from time to time in the future, allegations that we have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark, copyright and other intellectual property rights. For example, third parties have claimed that we have allegedly violated their trademark rights solely due to our display of third party products bearing an allegedly infringing mark. In the past, we have successfully resolved such claims without litigation.\nOther claims against us can be expected to be made in the future. Even if the claims are without merit, the costs associated with defending these types of claims may be substantial, both in terms of time, money, and diversion of management attention. In particular, patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop using certain trademarks, offering certain features, purchase licenses or modify our services and platform features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs. Though we have several pending patent applications and one issued U.S. patent, we may be unable to deter competitors or others from pursuing patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us.\nThe results of litigation and claims to which we may be subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, results or operations and reputation.\nSome of our solutions contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open source software that we have obtained from third parties or is included in software packages in our solutions and will use open source software in the future. Open source software is generally freely accessible, usable and modifiable, and is made available to the general public on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software and/or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid\ninfringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our brand, business and results of operations.\nWe seek to protect our trademarks, the source code for our proprietary software, domain names, and other proprietary information under a combination of patent law, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademark law to the extent we determine they are appropriate and cost-effective. We regard the protection of our pending patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names as critical to our success. In particular, we must maintain, protect and enhance the \u201cLeafly\u201d brand. We pursue the registration of our domain names and core trademarks in the United States and in certain jurisdictions abroad. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. Federal, state and/or local laws may limit or define the nature of permitted goods and services for which we can seek trademark registration. We typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information nor deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nEffective patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark and domain name protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and expenses and the costs of defending our rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our software is difficult, and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists or will occur in the future. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or alleging that we infringe the counterclaimant\u2019s own intellectual property. These steps may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property. Third parties may challenge the validity or ownership of our intellectual property, and these challenges could cause us to lose our rights, in whole or in part, to such intellectual property or narrow its scope such that it no longer provides meaningful protection. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our services and platform features and use information that we regard as proprietary to create services and platform features that compete with ours. Some of our terms of use provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our applications may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying, transfer and use of our brand, software, and proprietary technology or information may increase.\nThere can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. If we fail to meaningfully protect our intellectual property, our business, brands, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may be unable to continue to use our existing domain names, or prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as Leafly.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our products under a new domain name, which could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in question. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours. Domain names similar to ours have been registered by third parties in the United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nPublic Company and Financial Reporting Risks\nWe will incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are incurring and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur in the recent past, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC and national securities exchanges have created uncertainty for public companies and increased the costs and the time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure required of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any rules promulgated thereunder, as well as the rules of Nasdaq. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required, and, as a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns. These rules and regulations can also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors. Additionally, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. The increased costs of compliance with public company reporting requirements and our potential failure to satisfy these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, as a public company, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our Common Stock may decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, following consummation of the Business Combination, the report by management on internal control over financial reporting will be on Leafly\u2019s financial reporting and internal controls (as accounting acquirer). Once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d an attestation of the independent registered public accounting firm will also be required. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Leafly has not historically had to comply with all of these rules, and to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act and any complex accounting rules in the future, Leafly may need to upgrade its legacy information technology systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting and finance staff.\nIf we are unable to hire the additional accounting and finance staff necessary to comply with these requirements, we may need to continue to utilize outside consultants. If we or, if required, our independent registered public accounting firm, are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could negatively impact the price of our securities.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting now or in the future. We have not previously been required to conduct such an internal control evaluation and assessment. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness\nin our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nChanges in laws, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are now subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations or rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. As a result, our actual revenues, market share, expenses and profitability may differ materially from our expectations.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing and competitive industry and our projections will be subject to the risks and assumptions made by management with respect to our industry and business. Operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on a number of factors, including the competition we face, and our ability to attract and retain customers, deliver new products and services and expand market share. Additionally, our business may be affected by reductions in trading activity, loss of customers, lack of new products, competition, regulation and a number of factors which may be difficult to predict. This may result in decreased revenue levels, and we may be unable to adopt measures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause our operating results in a given quarter to be higher or lower than expected. These factors make creating accurate forecasts and budgets challenging and, as a result, we may fall materially short of our forecasts and expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline and investors to lose confidence in us.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, it could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance to the performance of other public companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, as of the closing of the Business Combination. As such, we are eligible for and intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, (a) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (b) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (c) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year (as indexed for inflation), (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) December 31, 2024, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of Common Stock in Merida\u2019s initial public offering. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required\nto comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAs an emerging growth company, we may also take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our shares of Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for our shares of Common Stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nAdditionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We expect that we will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (a) the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates does not equal or exceed $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (b) our annual revenues did not equal or exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nOur stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors and may continue to fluctuate for these and other reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or its failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow us or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, results of operations or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other retail or technology companies generally, or those in the cannabis industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022trading volume of our Common Stock;\n\u2022the inclusion, exclusion or removal of our Common Stock from any indices;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022transactions in our Common Stock by directors, officers, affiliates and other major investors;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our Common Stock;\n\u2022general economic conditions in the United States;\n\u2022pandemics or other public health crises, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic (including possible additional variants);\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of companies have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to their operating results. In the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur stock price may be exposed to additional risks because our business became a public company through a \u201cde-SPAC\u201d transaction. There has been increased focus by government agencies on transactions such as the Business Combination in the last year, and we expect that increased focus to continue, and we may be subject to increased scrutiny by the SEC and other government agencies and holders of our securities as a result, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAn active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained.\nOur Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cLFLY\u201d and trades on that market and others. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our Common Stock will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our Common Stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.\nWe may be required to purchase up to 3,860,740 shares of common stock pursuant to forward share purchase agreements, thereby reducing cash available to us for other purposes.\nPrior to the consummation of the Business Combination, we entered into forward share purchase agreements with certain investors, as discussed in greater detail in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These agreements provide that we may be obligated to purchase shares if these investors exercise an option to sell such shares to us. If the Investors exercise their respective options, we will have to expend funds to purchase those shares, which will reduce the cash available to us for other purposes. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell or indicate an intention to sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale if exercised or settled, as applicable, and to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All the shares of Common Stock subject to stock options outstanding and reserved for issuance under its equity incentive plans are expected to be registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and such shares are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline.\nAlthough the Sponsor, the Merida initial stockholders and the pre-Business Combination stockholders of Leafly remain subject to certain restrictions regarding the transfer of our Common Stock following the Business Combination, these shares may be sold after the expiration of their respective lock-ups. We intend to file one or more registration statements shortly after the closing of the Mergers to provide for the resale of such shares from time to time. As restrictions on resale end and the registration statements are available for use, the market price of our Common Stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, its business, our market, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Common Stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of the our Common Stock would likely decline. In addition, we currently expect that securities research analysts will establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. While we expect research analyst coverage, if no analysts commence or maintain coverage of us, the trading price and volume for our Common Stock could be adversely affected. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Common Stock to decline.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and Bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Common Stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of us or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022the right of the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022director removal solely for cause;\n\u2022\u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022the right of our board of directors to issue our authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022no ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022no right of our stockholders to act by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022limitations on the liability of, and the provision of indemnification to, our director and officers;\n\u2022the right of the board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we will continue to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which such person becomes an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person that, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors and the anti-takeover effect includes discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our Common Stock.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or Bylaws that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nOur Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or Bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. This provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our Bylaws provide further that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over lawsuits brought under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. To the extent the exclusive forum provision restricts the courts in which claims arising under the Securities Act may be brought, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. We note that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions, and there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the terms of our outstanding convertible notes restrict our ability to pay dividends, and any additional debt we or any of our subsidiaries may incur in the future may include similar restrictions. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, as of February 4, 2022, we had options outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,726,209 shares of our Common Stock, convertible notes outstanding which may convert into a maximum of 2,496,000 shares of our Common Stock, 1,625,194 shares of our Common Stock held by the holders of the Sponsor shares prior to Merida\u2019s initial public offering that are subject to earnout conditions, and Warrants outstanding to purchase 10,451,087 shares of our Common Stock. We also have the ability to initially issue up to 4,502,495 shares of Common Stock under the 2021 Plan and 1,125,624 shares of Common Stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and to issue up to an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock to former Leafly shareholders per the Merger Agreement and to Participants under the Earnout Plan.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances.\nOur issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects:\n\u2022Our existing stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends (if any) in the future, may decrease;\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of Common Stock may be diminished; and\n\u2022the market price of our shares of Common Stock may decline.\nThere is no guarantee that the Warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for the Warrants is $11.50 per share of Common Stock. There is no guarantee that the Warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the Warrants may expire worthless.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change or repay the convertible notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon redemption or repurchase of the convertible notes.\nHolders of the convertible notes have the right under the terms of the convertible notes to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the applicable maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. Moreover, we will be required to repay the convertible notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.\nWe may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of such convertible notes surrendered or pay cash with respect to the accrued and unpaid interest on such convertible notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase, redeem or to pay the accrued and unpaid interest in cash upon conversion of convertible notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by terms of the convertible notes or to pay the accrued and unpaid interest in cash upon conversion of such convertible notes as required by the terms of the convertible notes would constitute a default under such convertible notes. A default under the convertible notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the interest on such indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or to pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash upon conversion of the convertible notes.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. We are subject to certain restrictions under the terms of the convertible notes, including limitations regarding incurring future indebtedness, subject to specific allowances in the convertible notes. However, we will not be restricted from recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the convertible notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the convertible notes when due. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments and executing on our business plan.\nAs of December 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Business Combination, including the conversion of existing convertible notes and the issuance of new convertible notes, our total long-term debt was approximately $28.6 million, representing the $30 million principal of new convertible notes net of associated debt issuance costs. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. These risks include:\n\u2022inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt instruments;\n\u2022inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our business and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limits on our distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;\n\u2022inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the cannabis industry; and\n\u2022inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing.\nWe are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. In particular, if as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic our revenues, cash flows and/or EBITDA continue to decline or we incur additional indebtedness, we may be unable to make required payments on our debt or to satisfy the financial and other covenants contained in the convertible notes.\nRestrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.\nThe convertible notes contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022create or permit liens;\n\u2022enter into mergers; and\n\u2022sell, transfer or exchange assets.\nThese restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth strategy.\nGeneral Risks\nNegative publicity could adversely affect our reputation and brand.\nNegative publicity about our company, including our technology, sales practices, personnel or customer service, or the cannabis industry more generally, could diminish confidence in and the use of our services. Our reputation and brand, the traffic to our website and mobile application, and our business may suffer if consumer sentiment towards our platform and services, or the cannabis industry more generally, turns negative. In addition, our website and mobile application publish opinion pieces and serve as platforms for expression by our users, and third parties or the public at large may attribute the political or other sentiments expressed on our platform to us, which could harm our reputation.\nOur business depends in part on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of users, suppliers and partners, or our ability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \u201cLeafly\u201d brand is critical to expanding our base of users, suppliers and partners and increasing their engagement with our solutions, and will depend largely on our ability to maintain consumer trust in our service offerings and in the quality and integrity of the user content and other information found on our website and mobile\napplication. Other factors affecting our brand recognition and reputation that we have the ability to influence include the following:\n\u2022the efficacy of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022our ability to maintain a high-quality, innovative, and error- and bug-free platform;\n\u2022our ability to maintain high satisfaction among suppliers and consumers;\n\u2022the quality and perceived value of our platform;\n\u2022successfully implementing and developing new features, including alternative revenue streams;\n\u2022our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce trademarks and other indicia of origin that are valuable to our brand;\n\u2022our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022our compliance with laws and regulations, including those applicable to any political action committees that we support and to any lobbying activities we undertake;\n\u2022our ability to provide support to our customers and suppliers; and\n\u2022any actual or perceived data breach or data loss, or misuse or perceived misuse of our platform.\nIn addition, our brand recognition and reputation may be affected by factors that are outside our control, such as:\n\u2022actions of competitors or other third parties;\n\u2022the quality and timeliness of our suppliers\u2019 order processing businesses;\n\u2022consumers\u2019 experiences with suppliers or products identified through our platform;\n\u2022positive or negative publicity, including with respect to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, partners or others associated with any of these parties;\n\u2022interruptions, delays or cyber-attacks on our platform; and\n\u2022litigation or regulatory developments.\nDamage to our reputation and loss of brand equity from one or more of the factors listed above may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand may be costly and time-consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees and contractors, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our employees, including our leadership team, software engineers, legal, finance, marketing professionals, sales staff and contractors. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees and contractors. Qualified individuals are in high demand, in particular software engineers, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Our industry may pose additional challenges to attracting qualified individuals. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. All of our officers and other U.S. employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees and contractors or retaining and motivating existing employees and contractors, our business could be harmed.\nIf our security measures are compromised, or if our platform is subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our content, users may curtail or stop use of our platform.\nLike all online services, our platform is vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems,\nany of which could lead to interruptions, delays, or website shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or other confidential information. If we experience compromises to our security that result in performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our website, or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, our users or advertising partners may lose trust and confidence in us, and decrease the use of our platform or stop using our platform in its entirety. Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to, notify third parties of, or otherwise address the incident or breach and its root cause. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new users or deter current users from returning and increasing engagement and traffic, cause existing or potential suppliers and advertising partners to cancel their contracts or subject us to third party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby harming our results of operations.\nThe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on advertising spending by businesses, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and, particularly, their impact on levels of advertising spend by cannabis business, which are largely small and medium-sized businesses, and which may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns. In addition, our business may be directly affected by business cycles and other factors affecting the healthcare industry, due to the uses or potential uses of cannabis in the healthcare industry. To the extent that worldwide economic conditions (or other factors effecting the healthcare industry) materially deteriorate, our existing and potential advertising partners may no longer consider investment in our advertising solutions a necessity, or may elect to reduce advertising budgets. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spending, although this was generally not the case during the economic downturn in 2020-2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we experienced lower payment collection rates during the same period. In particular, web-based advertising solutions may be viewed by some of our existing and potential advertising partners as a lower priority and could cause advertising partners to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, terminate their use of our advertising solutions or default on their payment obligations to us. In addition, economic conditions may adversely impact levels of consumer spending, which could adversely impact the numbers of consumers visiting our website and mobile application. Consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. If spending at many of the local businesses reviewed on our website or mobile application declines, businesses may be less likely to use our advertising solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods, droughts, climate change, crop failure due to weather or other factors, water shortages and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, droughts, climate change, water shortages, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our U.S. corporate operations are located in the Seattle area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, acts of terrorism or civil unrest could cause disruptions in our or our suppliers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. For more information see \u201c- We rely upon cloud-based data centers, infrastructure and technologies provided by third parties, and technology systems and electronic networks supplied and managed by third parties, to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these systems, technologies and networks may adversely affect our business and operating results.\u201d\nAdditionally, our brand and retailer clients rely on agricultural businesses to grow cannabis. As such, our suppliers\u2019 businesses, and accordingly our business, are subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, including the risk of crop failure presented by weather, insects, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks. Any interruption in the business of cannabis growers due to such risks may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations and employees face risks related to health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect our\noperations, including at our headquarters or anywhere else we operate, and the business or operations of our suppliers, consumers, partners or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented significant measures intended to control the spread of the virus, including closures, quarantines, travel restrictions and other social distancing directives, and fiscal stimulus and other legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. In response to the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with applicable governmental orders, we have taken active measures to promote health and safety, including requiring all of our employees to work remotely. These and other operational changes we have implemented or may implement in the future may negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business.\nTo the extent that these restrictions remain in place, additional prevention and mitigation measures are implemented in the future, or there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of these or any other measures to contain or treat COVID-19, there is likely to be an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending, which could materially and adversely affect our operations as well as our relationships with suppliers and consumers. For instance, despite the overall increases in demand described below, some of our suppliers\u2019 operations and supply chains were initially significantly disrupted in certain jurisdictions, causing a temporary significant decrease in activity on our platform in those jurisdictions.\nBeginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we experienced a significant increase in demand from consumers using our online reservation system to submit orders for pick-up or delivery from licensed retailers on our platform, in conjunction with municipal, state and provincial lock-downs. Increased orders placed on our platform generally correlate with our ability to charge increased rates for subscriptions and advertising on our platform, which can lead to increased revenue from our suppliers. To the extent the circumstances that accelerated the initial growth of our business stemmed from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this may not continue in the future, and the growth rates in revenue and increases in MAUs may decline in future periods. As the broader economy started to reopen and restrictions lifted, in 2021, we saw a decline in our traffic from peak activity on our platform in the second quarter of 2020 to levels closer to those prior to the pandemic. This may negatively impact our ability to increase revenue generation.\nShelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to operate their businesses, consumers\u2019 ability to pick up orders, and our supplier\u2019s ability to make deliveries. Such events have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, a temporary closure of our suppliers\u2019 businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary preventative measures, and many of our suppliers may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their businesses, and may be forced to go out of business. Even if our suppliers are able to continue to operate their businesses, many may operate with limited hours and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or disruptions or closures of our suppliers\u2019 businesses could adversely affect our business. Further, we may experience a decrease in new suppliers due to a lack of financial resources or a decline in new markets as businesses and financial markets deal with the impact of COVID-19. Further, these conditions may impact our ability to access financial markets to obtain the necessary funding to expand our business as currently contemplated, which may adversely affect our liquidity and working capital.\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Our suppliers may be perceived as unsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our platform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar public health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the \u201cFFCRA\u201d) were enacted to provide economic relief to businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to the relief related to federal employment taxes provided in such legislation, we have elected to defer eligible payroll taxes, which will be due in two equal installments in 2021 and 2022.While we may be eligible to receive some economic relief pursuant to the CARES Act, FFCRA or other legislation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, cannabis businesses may not be eligible to take full advantage of the government-sponsored COVID-19 relief packages. As a result, we may not benefit from these relief efforts to the same extent other businesses do in different industries. These relief measures, including the CARES Act, may be beneficial to us in one or more reporting periods but may adversely affect us on a going-forward basis.\nThe extent of COVID-19\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Delta variant, and potential governmental and other restrictions resulting therefrom, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape.
