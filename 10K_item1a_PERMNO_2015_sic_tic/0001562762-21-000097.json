{"cik": "20520", "company": "FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also adversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nRisks Related to the Restructuring, Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the Restructuring contemplated in the Plan, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to consummate the Restructuring and to generate sufficient liquidity from the Restructuring to meet our obligations and operating needs. Our ability to consummate the Restructuring is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control. These factors, together with the Company\u2019s recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit, create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate the Restructuring on the terms set forth in the Plan, or at all, or realize all or any of the expected benefits from the Restructuring. See Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein for more information on the Restructuring and the risks related thereto.\nWe have sought the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, which subjects us to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy and may harm our business.\nWe have sought the protection of the Bankruptcy Court and as a result our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our ability to continue as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. As such, seeking Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Our senior management has been required to spend a significant amount of time and effort attending to the Restructuring instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other employees necessary to the success and growth of our business.\nOther significant risks include the following:\n\uf0b7our ability to consummate the Plan;\n\uf0b7the high costs of bankruptcy and related fees;\n\uf0b7the imposition of restrictions or obligations on the Company by regulators related to\nthe bankruptcy and emergence from Chapter 11;\n\uf0b7our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and\nexecute our business plan post-emergence;\n\uf0b7our ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties;\n\uf0b7our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations; and\n\uf0b7the actions and decisions of our debtholders and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases could increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\n\u200e\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nIf the Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement contains a number of termination events, some of which would give any consenting unsecured noteholders the right to terminate such Restructuring Support Agreement, which could adversely affect our ability to consummate the Plan. For example, the breach in any material respect by any of the Debtors of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth therein; the issuance by any governmental authority of any order that would be expected to prevent the consummation of the Restructuring Transactions (as defined in the Restructuring Support Agreement); an order or motion seeking the entry of an order dismissing one or more of the Chapter 11 Cases or converting the Chapter 11 Cases to a case under chapter 7; failure to meet any milestone under the Restructuring Support Agreement; the proposal or support of any plan of liquidation, asset sale of all or substantially all of the Debtor\u2019s assets or plan of reorganization other than the Plan, among others. If the Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, we may be unable to consummate the Plan, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into a new plan or that any new plan would be as favorable to holders of claims as the Plan that has been confirmed. In addition, any Chapter 11 Cases may become protracted, which could significantly and detrimentally impact our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties.\nThe consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Plan may not occur.\nWe will not complete the transactions contemplated by the Plan unless and until all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Plan are satisfied or waived. Those conditions include:\n\uf0b7the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Confirmation Order, with such Confirmation Order being a final order and in full force and effect;\n\uf0b7the issuance of the Reorganized Company\u2019s new common stock;\n\uf0b7the issuance of Takeback Debt;\n\uf0b7the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including from the FCC and state-level public utilities commissions; and\n\uf0b7such other conditions as mutually agreed by the Company and each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries that has executed the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Required Consenting Noteholders. (as defined herein).\nSome of these conditions are not under our control. There can be no assurance that any or all of the conditions precedent will be satisfied or waived or that these transactions will be completed as currently contemplated or at all. Even if these transactions are completed, they may not be completed on the anticipated schedule or terms. If these transactions are not completed on the anticipated schedule or terms, we may incur significant additional costs and expenses.\nWe will have a significant amount of indebtedness upon emergence and we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.\nUnder the Plan, we expect that we will have indebtedness of approximately $5.8 billion upon emergence of which approximately $5.1 billion will be secured, without giving effect to the potential issuance of takeback debt that is contemplated under the Plan. We may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although, the terms of the agreements currently governing our existing indebtedness restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications, and the indebtedness and/or liens incurred in compliance with such restrictions may be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us or our restricted subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, to the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.\nThe potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include:\n\uf0b7limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\uf0b7instances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and credit agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\ncircumstances have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;\n\uf0b7the possibility that we may trigger the springing maturity provisions in our credit agreements;\n\uf0b7the allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and dividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;\n\uf0b7requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\uf0b7compromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the telecommunications industry; and\n\uf0b7the possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who, relative to their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.\nIn addition, our New First Lien Notes and New Second Lien Notes, as well as our subsidiary indebtedness are rated below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by independent rating agencies. This has resulted in higher borrowing costs for us. These rating agencies may lower our debt ratings further, if in the rating agencies\u2019 judgment such an action is appropriate. A further lowering of a rating would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. Our negotiations with vendors, customers and business partners can be negatively impacted if they deem us a credit risk as a result of our credit rating.\nThe agreements governing our current indebtedness, and the terms of future indebtedness including the exit facilities and takeback debt, contain or will contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may reduce our operating and financial flexibility and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under these or other, future debt arrangements.\nWe face significant operational and industry challenges. Pressures on our business are resulting in a continued deterioration in revenue and liquidity and there is a lower outlook for our industry as a whole. While we have undertaken initiatives to strengthen our business, we have experienced significant challenges in achieving improvements in revenue and customer trends.\nThe terms of our DIP financing contain, and we expect that the terms of our exit financing and takeback debt will contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\uf0b7incur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\uf0b7incur or create liens;\n\uf0b7redeem and/or prepay certain debt;\n\uf0b7pay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;\n\uf0b7make certain investments;\n\uf0b7engage in specified sales of assets;\n\uf0b7enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\uf0b7engage in consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.\nIn addition, the exit facilities will require us to comply with specified financial ratios, including a maximum first lien coverage ratio. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the notes. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nfinancing. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including the notes.\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and its principal assets consist of the shares of capital stock or other equity instruments of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. The operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time may not be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed, and others may consider imposing, on regulated companies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to transfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations materially affect our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new regulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies.\nWe expect to be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to petition date, other than as provided in the Plan or the Confirmation Order. The Plan provides that holders of general unsecured claims, including, but not limited to, litigation claims against us and/or our subsidiaries, will have their claims \u201cride through\u201d the bankruptcy, meaning there is no bar to or discharge of these claims.\nIn particular, litigation claims against us will survive the bankruptcy and those claims may be pursued against us on or after the Effective Date, including but not limited to the amended consolidated class action complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on April 30, 2018 on behalf of certain purported stockholders against Frontier, certain of its current and former directors and officers and the underwriters of certain Frontier securities offerings asserting, among other things, violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act in connection with certain disclosures relating to the CTF Acquisition, and seeking damages and equitable and injunctive relief, and related derivative complaints against current and former directors. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nTo the extent such claims could have been asserted prior to bankruptcy or arose during the bankruptcy, such claims can be asserted after we emerge from bankruptcy.\nIn addition to potential liability for claims asserted against us, we will have ongoing obligations to indemnify our former officers and directors and certain underwriters in connection with litigation as we did before the bankruptcy. In particular, claims continue to be pursued against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers as well as certain underwriters, in connection with the securities class action described above. These claims consist of claims under the Federal securities laws related to, among other things, allegedly misleading statements or omissions with respect to certain disclosures relating to the CTF Acquisition. In addition to potential liability for claims asserted against us, we also have ongoing obligations to indemnify our officers and directors in connection with this litigation, as well as obligations to indemnify the underwriters of the relevant securities offering. To the extent we have any obligations to indemnify our directors and officers or the underwriters in connection with this litigation, such obligations will remain our obligations during and after the bankruptcy. Any such indemnification obligations could be material.\nIn October 2013, the California Attorney General\u2019s Office notified certain Verizon companies, including one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the CTF Acquisition, of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation. We have accrued an amount for potential penalties that we deem to be probable and reasonably estimated. This investigation will continue despite our bankruptcy. While we do not expect that any potential penalties, if ultimately incurred, will be material in comparison to the established accrual, the timing and ultimate outcome are uncertain.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nThe outcome and timing of these potential matters is uncertain, and it is possible that any one or more of these matters could result in material costs, penalties, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief. As a result, an adverse ruling with respect to these potential matters could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe negotiations regarding the Restructuring have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nOur management has spent, and continues to be required to spend, a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the Restructuring. This diversion of attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Restructuring is protracted. During the pendency of the Restructuring, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract members of our management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, we could experience losses of customers who may be concerned about our ongoing long-term viability.\nIn certain instances, the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nFollowing commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, upon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert such Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (Chapter 7). In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under the Plan. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we expect to adopt fresh-start accounting in accordance with ASC 852, Reorganizations. Under fresh-start accounting rules that we expect will apply to us upon the Effective Date, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. In addition, we may adopt accounting policy changes as part of fresh-start accounting and such policies could result in material changes to our financial reporting and results. Accordingly, we expect that our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements. Further, the Plan could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our historical consolidated financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization. In connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Any such charges could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our board of directors will, and our management team may, change significantly.\nUnder the Plan, the composition of our board of directors will change significantly upon emergence. Any new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who currently serve on our board of directors. For example, it was announced on September 1, 2020 that John Stratton has been selected to serve as executive chairman of our board of directors from emergence. While we expect to engage in an\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\norderly transition process as we integrate newly appointed board members, our board of directors following emergence from bankruptcy may have different views on strategic initiatives and a range of issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nPursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the finance committee of our board of directors together with the Management Selection Designees (as defined therein) commenced a management selection process for the Reorganized Company with respect to certain key management positions. Arising out of this process, we recently announced that Nick Jeffery will become Chief Executive Officer as of March 4, 2021 and will join our board of directors upon emergence. The composition of our management team may continue to change significantly. Qualified individuals are in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees or changes in the composition of our management team could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute their strategy and implement operational initiatives and have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the amount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\u2019s pension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\nWe made contributions of $64 million and $166 million to our pension plan in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we expect to continue to make contributions in future years. Required pension plan contributions for the fiscal year 2020 were estimated to be $184 million, including interest owed on contribution deferrals. Certain provisions of the CARES Act permit employers to postpone making pension contributions due in 2020 until January 4, 2021 and we postponed the remaining 2020 contributions of approximately $147 million, in the aggregate, as permitted by the CARES Act. In addition, we filed an application with the IRS for a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Section 302(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for the pension plan year beginning January 1, 2020. With the waiver we would spread the 2020 contribution, determined as of January 1, 2020 (approximately $173 million in total), over the five subsequent plan years, in addition to the minimum contributions owed for those plan years.\nVolatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact the costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future contribution to our pension plan could be material, and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.\nPension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases, lump sum payments, and retirement age. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could have a material impact on pension costs and obligations, and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our earnings, equity and funding requirements.\n\u200e\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss (NOLs) carryforwards of approximately $1.8 billion and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $9.9 billion. However, our ability to utilize these NOLs to offset taxable income may be limited in the future.\nA corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is typically subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC), an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases or sales of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\nFurthermore, to the extent our NOLs were generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (and therefore can only be carried forward for 20 years), we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire.\nIn an effort to safeguard our NOLs, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan in July 2019, under which Frontier\u2019s shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2019 received one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the rights plan, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.9 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Frontier\u2019s common stock without prior approval of our Board of Directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions, the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders (other than the acquiring shareholder or group) to purchase additional shares of Frontier at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the acquiring shareholder or group. Although the rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d. Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we determined that the Restructuring, the entry into the Restructuring Support Agreement, the approval of the Plan, the entry into the Definitive Documents (as defined in the Plan), and the consummation of the Restructuring and the other transactions contemplated by the Plan and the Definitive Documents are an \u201cExempted Transaction\u201d as defined in the Rights Plan.\nOn May 26, 2020, in connection with Frontier\u2019s Chapter 11 cases, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order approving certain notification and hearing procedures for transfers of, and declarations of worthlessness with respect to, beneficial ownership of common stock (the \u201cOrder\u201d). The Order is designed to protect Frontier\u2019s NOL carryforwards from the effect of a premature \u201cownership change\u201d, and to preserve Frontier\u2019s ability to rely on certain favorable rules that can apply to \u201cownership changes\u201d occurring in connection with the implementation of a bankruptcy plan of reorganization, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to fully protect the NOL carryforwards. The Order requires \u201csubstantial shareholders\u201d and \u201c50-percent shareholders\u201d (each as defined therein), and certain persons that might become a substantial shareholder or 50- percent shareholder, to provide notice before making certain transfers of beneficial ownership of common stock or declaring its beneficial ownership of stock worthless for U.S. income tax purposes, respectively. After receiving notice, Frontier is permitted to object, whereupon such action remains ineffective pending final resolution. Any action taken in violation of such procedures is invalid.\nThe impact of the Restructuring on our tax attributes such as federal and state NOLs and deferred tax asset relating to disallowed interest expense (\u201crelevant DTAs\u201d) will depend on whether the Restructuring is structured for tax purposes as (i) a taxable disposition of substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Company, (ii) a recapitalization of the Company, or (iii) some other alternative structure. If structured as a taxable disposition, we anticipate that our relevant DTAs (if any) remaining after the Restructuring will not be available to the Reorganized Company (the common parent of New Frontier Issuer\u2019s consolidated federal tax group). If structured as a recapitalization, we anticipate that we will experience an ownership change, and thus our relevant DTAs (if any) remaining after the restructuring will be subject to limitation, such that the Reorganized Company may not derive all of the benefits of any such remaining NOLs. While not free from doubt, we expect that the Restructuring will be structured as a taxable disposition of substantially all of our assets and/or subsidiary stock, in which case our relevant DTAs will not be available to the Reorganized Company. In either case, the consummation of the Restructuring may\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nhave an adverse tax impact on us and could give rise to U.S. federal, state or local income tax liabilities. If an \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur prior to the conclusion of the Restructuring, any tax liability recognized in connection with the Restructuring, particularly if the Restructuring is structured as a taxable disposition of substantially all of our assets and/or subsidiary stock, could be meaningfully increased.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our current and future initiatives to increase our revenues, profitability and cash flows are unsuccessful, our financial position and results of operations will be negatively and adversely impacted.\nWe must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and borrowing under our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, pay our taxes, and fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations. We continue to experience revenue declines as compared to prior years. We have undertaken, and expect to continue to undertake, programs and initiatives with the objective of improving revenues, profitability, and cash flows by enhancing our operations and customer service and support processes. In particular, under our modernization plan we intend to grow our fiber network and optimize our existing copper network at attractive IRRs in order to increase our revenues and customer trends, and in turn increase our profitability and cash flows. These programs and initiatives require significant resources and may divert attention from ongoing operations and other strategic initiatives. Despite similar efforts in the past, we have historically experienced significant challenges in achieving improvements in revenue and customer trends. For example, in the second quarter of 2019, we significantly reduced our forecast for the anticipated long-term results of a transformation program and we continue to evolve our operational strategies and priorities.\nThere can be no assurance that our current and future initiatives and programs will be successful, and even if they are successful, the actual returns from these programs and initiatives may be less than anticipated or may take longer to realize than we anticipate. For example, we may not reach our targets to expand our existing fiber network on the timelines we anticipate, or at all. If current and future programs and initiatives are unsuccessful, result in lower returns than we anticipate, or take longer than we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.\nThe effects of COVID-19, including its impact on market conditions, may adversely impact our business and hinder our exit financing and our ability to emerge from Chapter 11.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn have adversely affected the financial markets and the economy more generally and could result in an economic downturn, which could adversely impact our business. As of December 31, 2020, the markets remain volatile and the economic outlook remains uncertain. We are relying on the equity and debt capital markets in order to finance our emergence from Chapter 11. Adverse capital market conditions related to COVID-19 (or otherwise) could make it more difficult or expensive, or even infeasible, to emerge from Chapter 11 through the use of one or more capital market financing transactions.\nWith more people staying at home and an increased reliance on broadband and telephone networks, the FCC issued the Keep Americans Connected Pledge on March 11, 2020, which provided for telecommunication providers, including Frontier, to not terminate service and to waive any late payment fees through June 30, 2020 for certain customers due to economic circumstances they are facing related to COVID-19 as well as making WIFI hotspots available to all Americans who need them. In addition, some of the states we operate in have issued executive orders as a result of COVID-19 that further impact our business, including prohibiting the disconnection of services for customers for the length of the state of emergency. The initial Keep Americans Connected Pledge has expired; however, state and federal governments continue to ask companies to aid in pandemic response. While certain customers have taken advantage of our COVID-19 related relief programs, as of December 31, 2020, very few had past due balances beyond the point of normal disconnection. Given the unprecedented and evolving nature of the pandemic and the swift moving response of multiple levels of government as well as the uncertainty of funding available for services provided, the full impact of these changes and potential changes on the Company are unknown at this time.\nWhile overall the operational and financial impacts to our business of the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not significant, we continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact to our employees, our customers, our business and our results of operations. We have experienced a slowdown in service activations and an increase in deactivations for our SMB customers; to date, these negative impacts have been partially offset\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nby higher residential activations and lower churn, but there can be no assurance they will continue to be offset. We also continue to closely track our customers\u2019 payment activity as well as external factors, including the expiration of federal wage subsidies for individuals and small businesses which could materially impact payment trends. With more people working from home, we have experienced higher demands on our network and higher sales activity for our residential broadband service offering. This sustained increase in network demand could lead to reduced network availability and potential outages, which may impair our ability to meet customer service level commitments, lead to higher costs, higher customer churn and potential increased regulatory actions. These potential changes, among others, could have a material financial impact to Frontier.\nIn addition to committing to the Keep Americans Connected Pledge, our response to COVID-19 has included several operational safety precautions such as limiting our product offerings in certain markets for certain periods, including not allowing our field service employees to enter a customer\u2019s home for a period of time, a limitation which is no longer in effect. We are continuing to require personal protective equipment on any employees entering a customer location. Through December 31, 2020, we had not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain; however, some of our business partners, particularly those vendors operating outside of the United States, have been more greatly impacted which has affected our service levels and distribution of work, and resulted in disruptions to our supply chain or other aspects of our business.\nAdditionally, potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on our business include the potential for higher borrowing costs due to the increasing difference in the higher yield of lower-rated debt as compared to the lower yield of higher-rated debt of similar maturity and incremental financing needs. Our analysis of the potential impact of COVID-19 is subject to change. We are unable to predict the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 situation and its effects on the business and general economic conditions in the United States of America. We continue to monitor and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere can be no assurance as to the effect that the Transactions and Chapter 11 Cases will have on our relationships with our business partners.\nThere can be no assurance as to the effect that the Transactions and being in Chapter 11 Cases will have on our relationships with our suppliers, customers, service providers or employees, nor can there be any assurance as to the effect on such relationships of any delay in the completion of the Transactions. To the extent that any of these events result in the tightening of payment or credit terms, increases in the price of supplied goods, or the loss of one or more major customers, service providers or key employees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition.\nThe communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and various service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets. Our competitors include CLECs, internet service providers, wireless companies, OTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be subject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our markets that are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. Several competitors were successful bidders in the RDOF auction in areas within Frontier\u2019s service footprint and we expect these competitors will deploy expanded services in these areas that will compete with our services. We also believe that wireless and cable providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely impacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products or services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure investments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to deliver high quality customer service, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nstrategies by competitors. Increasing competition may reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flows.\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers and may lose customers as a result.\nThe communications industry is subject to significant changes in technology and replacing or upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant capital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and capacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers.\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other service providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain existing customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In addition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability to attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a material manner.\nSome of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us at a disadvantage.\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical, marketing and financial capabilities which are substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly less debt and are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, including leading edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and various types of data science, as well as take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost advantages and greater financial resources of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively compete.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur information technology networks and infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or third-party error or malfeasance, power outages, communication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nFurther, our network and information systems are subject to various risks related to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers, data centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information. While we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not control their actions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers using our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\u2019 equipment and data.\nWhile we maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our business and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training around the cyber risks we face, these risks are constantly evolving and are challenging to mitigate. Like many companies, we are the subject of increasingly frequent cyber-attacks. Any unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\ncustomers\u2019 sensitive information; financial loss; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future protection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; government investigations and legal claims or proceedings, fines and other liabilities. There can be no assurance that the impact of such incidents would not be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business is sensitive to continued relationships with our wholesale customers.\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we provide service. We seek to maintain and grow our business with these customers, however we face significant competition for this wholesale business. Additionally, the Restructuring may make our business partners less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our business. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 70% of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Of this unionized workforce, approximately 54% are covered by collective agreements that expire in 2021 and approximately 16% are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2022. In addition, approximately 30% of the unionized workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are on extensions from the dates on which they originally expired in 2019 or 2020.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to operate our business successfully.\nOur success will depend in part upon the continued services of our management team. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our business. In addition, the Restructuring may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain management and other key personnel, which could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our video systems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content providers, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability.\nWe continue to execute on our video strategy of achieving savings by renegotiating contracts to lower content costs or dropping channels entirely. The content owners of the programming that we carry on our multichannel video systems are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a content owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content that customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower profitability.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nWe are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings, including, from time to time, individual actions, class and putative class actions, and governmental investigations, covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contract disputes, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, sales and the provision of services, trademark and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with carriers. Litigation is subject to uncertainty and the outcome if individual matters is not predictable. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or enter into settlements with governmental or other entities which impose significant financial and business remediation measures.\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors.\nWe depend on a number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including network elements such as digital and internet protocol switching and routing equipment, optical and copper transmission equipment, broadband connectivity equipment, various forms of customer premise equipment, optical fiber, wireless equipment, as well as the software that is used throughout our network to manage traffic, network elements, and other functions critical to our operations. If any of our major suppliers were to experience disruption, supply-chain interruptions, financial difficulties, or other unforeseen problems delivering, maintaining, or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may affect the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us and may adversely impact our operations. In addition, due to changes in the communications industry, the suppliers of many of these products and services have been consolidating. In the event it were to become necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, or utilities on economically-attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Oversight\nChanges in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($89 million, or 1% in 2020 and $102 million, or 1%, in 2019) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services we provide in originating intrastate and interstate long-distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates Frontier can charge for switched access are regulated by the FCC and state regulatory agencies.\nIn 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of voice traffic between carriers. However, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on Intercarrier Compensation. In an October 2020 order, the FCC adopted a 2-year transition of 1-800 (toll free) switched access charges to bill and keep beginning July 2021, thus further reducing this declining revenue stream. The FCC continues to consider the possibility of further reducing access rates in the future. We cannot predict when or how the FCC would implement any changes originating access rates, and future reductions in these revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIn April 2017, the FCC issued an order that resulted in substantial deregulation in a number of our markets for special access services where the market is determined to be competitive and the transport market nationwide. While some aspects of the 2017 Order were appealed by stakeholders the 8th Circuit issued a decision that upheld the majority of the 2017 Order. The FCC has since reaffirmed the portions of the 2017 Order that were vacated, and no party appealed the FCC\u2019s second decision.\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate access charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their proceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($344 million, or 5%, in 2020 and $365 million, or 4%, in 2019) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, that consists primarily of CAF II support, as well as Federal High Cost support and various state subsidies. The FCC\u2019s 2011 Order changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed. These changes transitioned the USF (Universal Service Fund), which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF (Connect America Fund), which supports broadband deployment in high-cost areas. In June 2015, we accepted the FCC\u2019s offer of support to price cap carriers under the CAF Phase II program in 25 states, which, excluding the support related to the Northwest Operations divested on May 1, 2020, provides $313 million in annual support through 2021 in return for our commitment to make broadband available to households within our footprint.\nOn January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF program. The FCC held the RDOF Phase I auction from October 29, 2020 through November 25, 2020 and announced the results on December 7, 2020. Frontier was awarded approximately $371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations across eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). Frontier submitted its Long Form application to the FCC on January 29, 2021 and, assuming the long-form application is granted by the FCC, anticipates that it will begin receiving funding on January 1, 2022. The program will not be as favorable to us as the CAF Phase II program, and this program will result in a material reduction in the level of funding that we receive from the FCC under the CAF Phase II program (approximately $332 million in annual support) to approximately $37 million in annual support under RDOF beginning in 2022. Our inability to replace a substantial portion of this reduction, will in turn result in a material reduction in our revenue and operating income, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are required to contribute to the USF and the FCC allows us to recover these contributions through a USF surcharge on customers\u2019 bills. This surcharge accounted for $193 million of revenue in 2020 and $221 million in 2019. Our inability to recover USF contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nFuture reductions in these subsidies, the inability to replace a substantial portion of our CAF II or RDOF funding, or our inability to recover USF contributions, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWhile we plan to implement a number of operational initiatives before and following our emergence from bankruptcy in order to realize certain cost savings, our ability to achieve such cost savings on a timely basis, or at all, is subject to various risks and assumptions by our management, which may or may not be realized. In addition, our ability to achieve such costs savings is subject to the incurrence of other costs in our operations, which may be material and may offset all or a portion of such cost savings. As a result, we may not be able to realize these anticipated cost savings on a timely basis or at all. Even if we do realize some or all of such cost savings, they may be insufficient to offset any reductions in subsidies or CAF Phase II funding we receive, or our inability to recover USF contributions.\nFrontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to change our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates and could impose substantial compliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge, imposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations, regulatory oversight, or changes to these regulations will affect Frontier\u2019s operations or ability to compete in the future.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nFCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to intercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations.\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states, including California, have considered or are moving forward with legislation on these or other Internet-related issues. Multiple states have taken executive or legislative action directed at reinstating aspects of the FCC\u2019s 2015 Order. We cannot predict whether the outcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC\u2019s order or subsequent state actions will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position. It is also unclear the degree to which the outcome of the November 2020 elections may impact federal or state legislative or regulatory action on net neutrality and privacy issues.\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that have in the past, and may in the future, investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection matters.\nCertain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such agencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business practices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions, including regarding the failure to meet technological needs or expectations of our customers. Such inquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state regulatory agencies regarding commitments the Company made and others that were imposed by the regulatory agencies in association with securing federal and state regulatory approval for the Restructuring.\nThe Company made a number of affirmative commitments to federal and certain state regulators to secure approval for the Restructuring, including specific investment, broadband service deployment, service quality improvements, reporting, and compliance commitments. Regulators will monitor and may launch compliance inquiries or investigations and if the Company is found to have failed to comply with its obligations it could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, penalties, fines, settlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the Company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nTax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nTax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and imposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities.\nMore recently, on March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCR Act), and on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act were each enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFCR Act and the CARES Act contain numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this legislation on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Future regulatory guidance under the FFCR Act and the CARES Act (as well as under the TCJA) may be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen their impact on our business and financial condition. It is also highly possible that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which could have an impact on the Company.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)\nThe determination of the benefit from (or provision for) income taxes requires complex estimations and significant judgments concerning the applicable tax laws. If in the future any element of tax legislation changes the related accounting guidance for income tax, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the benefit from (or provision for) income taxes accordingly.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nUnder the Plan, we currently anticipate that our common stock will be canceled and that holders of such common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nThe Plan provides that all equity interests of existing equity holders will be extinguished. Amounts invested by the holders of our common stock will not be recoverable and such securities will have no value. Trading prices for these securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of in the Chapter 11 Cases. Furthermore, the Plan provides that certain holders of our debt will receive 100% of the common equity (the New Common Stock) of the Company or an entity formed to indirectly acquire substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Reorganized Company, subject to dilution by certain permitted management incentive plans. There can be no assurance that an active public trading market for our common stock will be sustained, or that there will be an active public trading market for the New Common Stock of the Reorganized Company.\nAs a result of our filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, our common stock has been delisted from NASDAQ which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and stock price.\nFollowing our filing for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, our common stock was delisted from NASDAQ, which could negatively impact the trading price, trading volume, liquidity, availability of price quotations, news and analyst coverage of, and have other material adverse effects on, our common stock. Our common stock is now quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets market maintained by the OTC Market Group, Inc. under the trading symbol \u201cFTRCQ.\u201d The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our common stock. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock, the price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets\u2019 perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAdditionally, the delisting may adversely impact the perception of the Company\u2019s financial condition and cause reputational harm with investors and parties conducting business with the Company. The perceived decreased value of employee equity incentive awards may reduce their effectiveness in encouraging performance and retention. Each of these occurrences, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u200e\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION)", "PERMNO": 23887, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "FTRCQ"}
