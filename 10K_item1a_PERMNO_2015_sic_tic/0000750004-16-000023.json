{"cik": "750004", "company": "SCIENTIFIC GAMES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Please be aware that additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business operations. You should also refer to the other information contained in our periodic reports, including the Forward-Looking Statements section, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business. Except where the context otherwise indicates, references below to the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ours\" and \"us\" include all of our subsidiaries.\nRisks Relating to our Business and our Industries\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses.\nWe face significant competition in our traditional Gaming and Lottery businesses and in the evolving interactive gaming and lottery industries, not only from our traditional competitors but also from a number of other domestic and foreign providers (or, in some cases, the operators themselves), some of which have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience than we do. In addition, we cannot assure you that our products and services will be successful or that we will be able to attract and retain players as our products and services compete with the products and services of others, which may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nGaming\nOur Gaming business faces significant competition, including from illegal operators. There are a limited number of gaming operators and many established companies offer competing products. We compete on the basis of the content, features, quality, functionality and price and financing terms of our products and services and the quality and responsiveness of our services. Some of our product lines may compete against each other for space on the casino floor. Consolidation of casino operators and other operators, increased competition among operators and economic conditions causing reductions in capital expenditures by operators have significantly increased the level of competition among gaming suppliers.\nWe also face high levels of competition in the supply of products and services for newly legalized gaming jurisdictions and for openings of new or expanded casinos. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully enter new markets and compete successfully for new business especially in the face of declining demand for gaming machine replacements.\nWe also compete to obtain space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors. Casino operators focus on performance, longevity, player appeal and price when making their purchasing decisions. Competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines and more game themes than ours may have an advantage in obtaining and retaining placements in casinos. Additionally, we face competition from the increased number of small gaming equipment companies that have emerged in the gaming space in recent years and are able to focus their resources on developing a smaller number of high-performing products.\nWe have offered customers discounts, free trials and free gaming equipment, including conversion kits (and, in some cases, free gaming machines) in connection with the sale or placement of our products and services. In addition, we have, in some cases, agreed to modify pricing and other contractual terms in connection with the sale or placement of our products. There can be no assurance that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers or agree to modify contractual terms in ways that are unfavorable to us, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have provided a higher level of extended payment term financing for product purchases and we expect to continue providing a higher level of extended payment term financing in this business until the economy and industry conditions improve and demand for such financings abates. We believe that our competitors also offer extended payment term financings to customers in similar situations. Our competitors may provide a greater amount of financing or better terms than we do and this may impact demand for our Gaming products and services.\nThe competition for casino-management technology solutions and systems is significant. Product features and functionality, accuracy, reliability, service level and pricing are among the factors that determine how successful providers are in selling their systems. Competition for these products is intense due to the low number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate.\nWe compete in our table products business on the basis of the scope and reliability of our products and services, our intellectual property and the extent of our sales, regulatory and distribution channels. Our Shufflers also compete against hand shuffling, which remains the most competitive shuffling option for casino card games around the world. Finally, since the need for our Shufflers is dependent upon the casino's use of live table games, our Shufflers also compete against any products that live table games compete against.\nCompetition for PTG content is focused on player appeal, brand recognition, price and the strength of underlying intellectual property. We compete on this basis, as well as on the extent of our sales, service, marketing and distribution channels. We also compete with several companies that primarily develop and license PTGs, as well as with non-proprietary table games such as blackjack and baccarat. It is easier for smaller companies to participate in developing and marketing PTG content relative to other gaming products due to the lower cost and complexity associated with the development of PTG products.\nLottery\nOur Lottery business faces competition from a number of domestic and foreign businesses, some of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do, which impacts our ability to win new contracts and renew existing contracts. We continue to operate in a period of intense price-based competition, which has affected and could continue to affect the number and the profitability of the lottery contracts we win.\nContract awards by lottery authorities are sometimes challenged by unsuccessful bidders through costly and protracted legal proceedings that can result in delayed implementation or cancellation of awards. In addition, the U.S. lottery industry has matured such that we believe the number of states conducting lotteries is unlikely to increase materially in the near-term.\nWe believe our principal competitors in the instant lottery game business have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, their production capacity, resulting in pricing pressures in the instant lottery game business. This may adversely affect our ability to win or renew instant lottery game contracts or may reduce the profitability of instant lottery game contracts that we do win. We also compete in the international instant lottery game business with low-price printers whose quality we believe is lower than ours in regulated environments where laws are being reinterpreted to create competition from non-traditional lottery vendors and products. Our U.S. instant lottery game business could be adversely affected if additional foreign competitors operating in Canada export their lottery products to the U.S. or if other foreign competitors establish printing facilities in the U.S. or Canada to supply the U.S.\nWe face increased price competition in our lottery systems business from our two principal competitors in that business. Since the beginning of 2013, we have lost lottery systems contracts in Colorado and Indiana to our competitors following the expiration or termination of our contracts. In Indiana, we will continue to provide certain services through August 2016.\nAs some jurisdictions seek to privatize or outsource lottery operations (including partial privatizations through private management agreements or otherwise), we face competition from both traditional and new competitors with respect to these opportunities. In some cases, we may find it necessary or desirable to enter into strategic relationships with third parties, including competitors and may be required to commit significant sums of money in order to pursue these opportunities.\nAny future success of our Lottery business will also depend, in part, on the success of the lottery industry in attracting and retaining players in the face of increased competition for these players\u2019 entertainment dollars, as well as our own success in developing innovative products and systems to achieve this goal. Our failure to achieve this goal could reduce our revenue from our Lottery operations. Additionally, pressure on state and other government budgets could lead to other forms of gaming being legalized, which could adversely impact our Lottery business.\nInteractive\nOur Interactive social gaming and RMG businesses are also subject to significant competition. Our RMG business focuses on the supply of game content to online casino operators and there are a number of competitors in that industry, including from illegal or unregulated operators. Additionally, we have expanded into Interactive social gaming as have several of our competitors and our customers. This expansion also causes us to compete with social gaming companies that have no connection to regulated RMG and many of those companies have a base of existing users that is larger than ours. In order to stay competitive in both our Interactive social gaming and RMG businesses, we will need to continue to create and market game content that attracts players and invest in new and emerging technologies. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide internet wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to internet wagering in such countries.\nWe have offered customers discounts, free trials and free spins for end users in connection with the Interactive gaming businesses. There can be no assurance that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nUnfavorable U.S. and international economic conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including recession, economic slowdown, decreased liquidity in the financial markets, decreased availability of credit and relatively high rates of unemployment, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business. We cannot fully predict the effects that unfavorable economic conditions and economic uncertainty will have on us as they also impact our customers, suppliers and business partners.\nIn our Gaming business, especially our Participation gaming business, our revenue is driven in large part by players\u2019 disposable incomes and level of gaming activity. Unfavorable economic conditions have reduced the disposable incomes of casino patrons and resulted in fewer patrons visiting casinos, whether land-based or online, and lower amounts spent per casino visit. A further or extended decline in disposable income could result in reduced play levels on our Participation gaming machines, causing our results of operations and cash flows from these products to decline. Additionally, higher airfares and other costs may adversely affect the number of players visiting our customers\u2019 casinos. A decline in play levels may also\nnegatively impact the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of our casino customers and their ability to purchase our products and services. Unfavorable economic conditions may result in volatility in the credit and equity markets. The difficulty or inability of our customers to generate or obtain adequate levels of capital to finance their ongoing operations may reduce their ability to purchase our products and services.\nCurrent unfavorable economic conditions have impacted, and could continue to impact, the ability of our Gaming customers to make timely payments to us. In addition, continued unfavorable conditions have caused, and could continue to cause, some of our Gaming customers to ultimately declare bankruptcy, which would adversely affect our business. In recent years, our Gaming business has expanded the use of extended payment term financing for gaming machine purchases and we expect to continue providing a higher level of extended payment term financing in this business until demand from our customers for such financings abates. These financing arrangements may increase our collection risk and, if customers are not able to pay us, whether as a result of financial difficulties, bankruptcy or otherwise, we may incur provisions for bad debt related to our inability to collect certain receivables. In addition, both extended payment term financing and operating leases result in a delay in our receipt of cash, which reduces our cash balance, liquidity and financial flexibility to respond to changing economic events.\nIn our Lottery business, we believe that the difficult economic conditions have contributed to reductions in spending on marketing by our customers and, in certain instances, less favorable terms under our contracts, as many of our customers face significant budget shortfalls and seek to cut costs.\nThere are ongoing concerns regarding the debt burden of certain countries, particularly in Europe and South America, and their ability to meet their future financial obligations, which have resulted in downgrades of the debt ratings for these countries. We currently operate in, and our growth strategy may involve pursuing expansion or business opportunities in certain of these jurisdictions, such as Argentina, Greece, Italy, Puerto Rico and the Ukraine. These sovereign debt concerns, whether real or perceived, could result in a recession, prolonged economic slowdown, or otherwise negatively impact the general health and stability of the economies in these countries or more broadly. In more severe cases, this could result in a limitation on the availability or flow of capital, thereby restricting our liquidity and negatively impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In March 2015, we signed a contract to provide OPAP S.A. (\"OPAP\") with 5,000 VLTs pursuant to OPAP's ten-year license to operate a network of 16,500 VLTs across Greece. While deployment was expected to begin in the second quarter of 2015 and conclude by the end of 2015, political and economic issues in Greece have delayed the launch of the VLTs and placements may not begin until mid-2016, at the earliest.\nOur future results of operations may be negatively impacted by declines in the replacement cycle of gaming machines and by the slow growth of new gaming jurisdictions or slow addition of casinos in existing jurisdictions.\nDemand for our Gaming products and services is driven by the replacement of existing gaming machines in existing casinos, the establishment of new jurisdictions, the opening of additional casinos in existing jurisdictions and the expansion of existing casinos.\nOver the years, due to a variety of factors including the recent economic crisis and the slow or incomplete recovery, reduced investments and capital budgets and continued economic uncertainty, the replacement cycle for gaming machines has grown longer. Low levels of demand for gaming machine replacements could reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe opening of new casinos and expansion of existing casinos fluctuate with demand, economic conditions, regulatory approvals and the availability of financing. In addition, the expansion of gaming into new jurisdictions can be a protracted process. In the U.S., governments usually require a public referendum and legislative action before establishing or expanding gaming. Any of these factors could delay, restrict or prohibit the expansion of our business and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future results of operations may be negatively impacted by ownership changes and consolidation in the gaming industry, including by casino operators.\nAs repeat customers represent a substantial part of our revenue in our casino Gaming business, our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition could be negatively affected if our casino customers are sold to or merge with other entities. Such entities may purchase more products and services of our competitors, reduce spending on our products or cause downward pricing pressures. Consolidation among casino operators could result in order cancellations or a slowing in the replacement cycle for existing gaming machines, or could require our current customers to purchase our competitors\u2019 products, any of which could negatively impact our Gaming business.\nIn July 2015, two of the largest betting shop operators in the U.K., Ladbrokes and Gala Coral, announced that they intend to merge. The CMA is currently reviewing the proposed merger and may require that these operators divest a certain number of betting shops prior to consummating the contemplated transaction. As these two operators are the largest customers of our U.K. gaming business, their merger and/or any asset divestitures relating thereto, could negatively impact our business.\nGaming opponents persist in their efforts to curtail the expansion of legalized gaming, which, if successful, could limit the growth of our operations.\nThere is significant debate over, and opposition to, land-based and interactive gaming. There can be no assurance that this opposition will not succeed in preventing the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is presently prohibited, prohibiting or limiting the expansion of gaming where it is currently permitted or causing the repeal of legalized gaming in any jurisdiction. Any successful effort to curtail the expansion of, or limit or prohibit, legalized gaming could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to adapt to and offer products that keep pace with evolving technology related to our businesses.\nThe success of our products and services is affected by changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our ability to anticipate or respond to such changes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services, including, but not limited to, gaming and lottery content, gaming machines, casino-management systems, table products and interactive gaming products and services, on a timely basis or at all is a significant factor affecting our ability to remain competitive, retain existing contracts or business and expand and attract new customers and players. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the necessary technological advances or have the financial resources needed to introduce new products or services on a timely basis or at all.\nIn our Gaming business, our success depends upon our ability to respond to dynamic customer demand by producing new and innovative products and services. The process of developing new products and systems is inherently complex and uncertain. It requires accurate anticipation of changing customer needs and end user preferences as well as emerging technological trends. If our competitors develop new game content and technologically innovative products and we fail to keep pace, our business could be adversely affected. If we fail to accurately anticipate customer needs and end user preferences through the development of new products and technologies, we could lose business to our competitors, which would adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may experience manufacturing, operational or design problems that could delay or prevent the launch of new products or services. Introducing new and innovative products and services requires us to adapt and refine our manufacturing, operations and delivery capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs associated with our product innovations, or if we are unable to upgrade our production capacity in a timely manner, our Gaming business could be negatively impacted. In the past, we have experienced delays in launching new products and services due to the complex or innovative technologies embedded in our products and services. Such delays can adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, the social gaming landscape is rapidly evolving and is characterized by major fluctuations in the popularity of social products and platforms, such as mobile. We may be unable to develop products at a rate necessary to respond to these changes, or at all, or that anticipate the interests of social players. Likewise, our social gaming offerings operate largely through Facebook, Google Play for Android devices, Apple\u2019s iOS platform, Kindle's platform, Yahoo's platform and Microsoft Windows. If alternative platforms increase in popularity, we could be adversely impacted if we fail to timely create compatible versions of our products.\nOur success also depends on creating products and services with strong and sustained player appeal. We are under continuous pressure to anticipate player reactions to, and acceptance of, our new products, avoid jackpot fatigue (declining play levels on smaller jackpots) and continue to provide successful products that generate a high level of play. In some cases, a new game or gaming machine will only be accepted by our casino or Interactive gaming customers if we can demonstrate that it is likely to produce more revenue and Net win and/or has more player appeal than our existing products and services or our competitors\u2019 products and services.\nWAP, premium and daily fee Participation gaming machines are replaced on short notice by casino operators if they do not meet and sustain revenue and profitability expectations. Customers may cancel pending orders with us if our products are not performing to expectations at other casinos.\nWe have invested, and may continue to invest, significant resources in R&D efforts. We invest in a number of areas, including product development for game and system-based hardware, software and game content. In addition, because of the sophistication of our newer products and the resources committed to their development, they are generally more expensive to produce. If our new products do not gain market acceptance or the increase in the average selling price of these new products is not proportionate to the increase in production cost, in each case as compared to our prior products, or if the average cost of production does not go down over time, whether by reason of long-term customer acceptance, our ability to find greater efficiencies in the manufacturing process as we refine our production capabilities or a general decrease in the cost of the technology, our margins will suffer and could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our investment in R&D will lead to successful new technologies or products. If a new product is not successful, we may not recover our development, regulatory approval or promotion costs.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop, enhance and/or introduce successful gaming concepts and game content.\nOur businesses develop and source game content both internally and through third-party suppliers. We also seek to secure third-party brands for incorporation into our game content. We believe that creative and appealing game content produces more revenue for our gaming machine customers and provides them with a competitive advantage, which in turn enhances our revenue and our ability to attract new business and to retain existing business. In our Lottery business, we believe that innovative game concepts and game content, such as multiplier games and game content that incorporates licensed brands, can enhance the revenue of our lottery customers and distinguish us from our competitors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain the success of our existing game content or effectively develop or obtain from third parties game content or licensed brands that will be widely accepted both by our customers and players.\nWe and our industries are subject to strict government regulations that may limit our existing operations and have an adverse impact on our ability to grow.\nIn the U.S. and many other countries, the provision of Gaming and Lottery products and services is subject to extensive and evolving regulation. These regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Therefore, we are subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed or operate. Most jurisdictions require that we be licensed, that our key personnel and certain of our security holders be found suitable or be licensed, and that our products be reviewed and approved before placement. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked, suspended or conditioned. If a license, approval or finding of suitability is required by a regulatory authority and we fail to seek or do not receive the necessary approval, license or finding of suitability, or if it is granted and subsequently revoked, then we may be prohibited from providing our products or services for use in the particular jurisdiction. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license, or affect our eligibility for a license, in other jurisdictions. We may also become subject to regulation in any new jurisdictions in which we decide to operate in the future, including due to expansion of a customer\u2019s operations. Gaming authorities may levy fines against us or seize certain of our assets if we violate gaming regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses or approvals or that the licensing process will not result in delays or adversely affect our operations. The failure to obtain or retain a required license or approval in any jurisdiction would decrease the geographic areas where we are permitted to operate and generate revenue, may limit our ability to obtain a license in other jurisdictions and may put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nThere can be no assurance that authorities will not seek to restrict our business in their jurisdictions or institute enforcement proceedings against us. There can be no assurance that any instituted enforcement proceedings will be favorably resolved, or that such proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain and renew existing licenses or to obtain new licenses in other jurisdictions. Our reputation may also be damaged by any legal or regulatory investigation, regardless of whether or not we are ultimately accused of, or found to have committed, any violation.\nOften, our games, Gaming product hardware and software and our Interactive gaming products and services must be approved in the jurisdictions in which they are operated, and we cannot assure you that such products or services will be approved in any jurisdiction. Our networked gaming technology requires regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to the shipment or implementation of any gaming machines, products or services and, although we have received approvals from the jurisdictions in which we currently operate this technology, we cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to offer it in additional gaming jurisdictions. Many of our customers are required to be licensed and delays in approvals of our customers\u2019 operations or expansions may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, current regulations in a number of jurisdictions where our customers operate, such as Macau SAR and Singapore, limit the amount of space allocated to our products or limit the amount of new product available to operators to an amount that has been pre-approved by regulators. Substantial changes in any such regulations could adversely affect demand for our products.\nThe regulatory review process and licensing requirements also may preclude us from using technologies owned or developed by third parties if those parties are unwilling to subject themselves to regulatory review or do not meet regulatory requirements. Some gaming authorities require gaming manufacturers to obtain approval before engaging in certain transactions, such as acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations, financings, stock offerings and share repurchases. Obtaining such approvals can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted or that the approval process will not result in delays or disruptions to our strategic objectives.\nIn April 2015, the U.K. government implemented new regulations for fixed odds betting terminals, also known as B2 gaming terminals, which are typically located in LBOs. These new regulations affect players who bet more than \u00a350 per play and, among other things, require such players to have registered player accounts or to fund their accounts at the counter rather than the betting terminal. We believe that these changes have negatively impacted our U.K. customers\u2019 businesses and, therefore, our U.K. gaming business. The U.K. government is currently in the process of reviewing the effect of the new regulations as part of its 2016 triennial review of stakes and prizes for all gaming terminals, which may lead to additional regulations. Any changes to stakes and prizes could negatively impact our customers or our U.K. gaming business.\nWe and certain of our affiliates, major stockholders (generally persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically 5% or more) of our equity securities), directors, officers and key employees are subject to extensive background investigations and suitability standards in our businesses. In some jurisdictions, these investigations may require extensive personal and financial disclosure from major stockholders, directors, officers and key employees. The failure of any such individuals or entities to submit to such background checks and provide the required disclosure could jeopardize the award of a contract or license to us or provide grounds for termination of an existing contract or license. Regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion when granting, renewing or revoking these approvals and licenses. Gaming and lottery authorities may require the removal of any of our directors or employees who are deemed to be unsuitable and these authorities are generally empowered to disqualify us from receiving a Gaming or Lottery contract or offering our Gaming or Lottery products and services in that jurisdiction as a result of any such investigation. Our failure, or the failure of any of our major stockholders, directors, officers, key employees, products or technology, to obtain or retain a required license or approval in one jurisdiction could negatively impact our ability (or the ability of any of our major stockholders, directors, officers, key employees, products or technology) to obtain or retain required licenses and approvals in other jurisdictions.\nIn light of these regulations and the potential impact on our business, our restated certificate of incorporation allows for the restriction of stock ownership by persons or entities who fail to comply with informational or other regulatory requirements under applicable gaming laws, who are found unsuitable to hold our stock by gaming authorities or whose stock ownership adversely affects our ability to obtain, maintain, renew or qualify for a license, contract, franchise or other regulatory approval from a gaming authority. The licensing procedures and background investigations of the authorities that regulate our businesses and the restriction in our certificate of incorporation may inhibit potential investors from becoming significant stockholders or inhibit existing stockholders from retaining or increasing their ownership.\nThere are instances where a state in which a Native American tribe conducts Class III gaming activities disagrees with such tribe regarding the regulation of gaming, including the regulation of gaming suppliers. In those instances, we make every effort to comply with both state and tribal regulation and fulfill our contractual obligations. However, there may be situations where any such disagreement impedes or creates uncertainty with respect to our ability to supply gaming products and services to such tribal customer or otherwise negatively impacts our relationship with such customer or gaming regulators. There are additional complexities that may impact disputes or other interactions with Native American tribe customers. For example, Native American tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits, similar to the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the individual states and the U.S. In addition, certain commercial agreements with Native American tribes are subject to review by regulatory authorities such as the National Indian Gaming Commission, and, among other things, any such review could require substantial modifications to any such agreement we enter into with a Native American tribe customer.\nOur businesses are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer data. In particular, the EU has adopted strict data privacy regulations and in October 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. under the EU/U.S. Safe Harbor was an invalid mechanism of personal data transfer, making transfers of EU personal data to the U.S. even more challenging. The scope of data privacy and security regulations continues to evolve and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely within the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Compliance with data privacy and security restrictions could increase the cost of our operations and failure to comply with such restrictions could subject us to criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties.\nWe are subject to the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. persons and companies and their agents from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Certain of these anti-corruption laws also contain provisions that require accurate record keeping and further require companies to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective or an employee or intermediary fails to comply with the applicable regulations, we may be subject to criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. Any such violation could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have developed and implemented an internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our Gaming and Lottery activities, as well as legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. The compliance program is run on a day-to-day basis by our chief compliance officer with legal advice provided by attorneys in our legal and compliance departments and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the compliance committee of our board of directors, consisting of our chief executive officer, three non-employee directors and a non-employee gaming law expert. There can be no assurance that such steps will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine, suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses or other penalties.\nThe regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future, including changes that limit some or all of our existing operations in that jurisdiction, and any such change could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, financial condition, business or prospects. Moreover, there can be no assurance that Gaming, Lottery or Interactive gaming-related activities will be approved by additional jurisdictions or that those jurisdictions in which these activities are currently permitted will continue to permit such activities. Laws and regulations relating to our Interactive gaming businesses are evolving. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the evolving interactive gaming regulatory landscape, see the risk factor below captioned \"We may not be able to capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of interactive gaming or other trends and changes in the gaming and lottery industries, including due to laws and regulations governing these industries.\"\nSee Exhibit 99.12 (Gaming Regulations) for additional information regarding certain of the regulations that govern our Gaming business.\nWe may not be able to capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of interactive gaming or other trends and changes in the gaming and lottery industries, including due to laws and regulations governing these industries.\nWe participate in the new and evolving interactive gaming and lottery industries through our social, RMG and other Interactive gaming products. Part of our strategy is to take advantage of the liberalization of interactive gaming, both within the U.S. and internationally. These industries involve significant risks and uncertainties, including legal, business and financial risks. The success of these industries and of our Interactive gaming products and services may be affected by future developments in social networks, including Facebook, mobile platforms, regulatory developments, data privacy laws and other factors that we are unable to predict and are beyond our control. This fast-changing environment can make it difficult to plan strategically and can provide opportunities for competitors to grow their businesses at our expense. Consequently, our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition relating to our Interactive gaming and Lottery products and services are difficult to predict and may not grow at the rates we expect, and we cannot provide assurance that these products and services will be successful in the long term.\nIn general, our ability to successfully pursue our interactive gaming strategy depends on the laws and regulations relating to wagering through interactive channels. Until 2011, there was uncertainty as to whether the Federal Wire Act of 1961 prohibited states from conducting intrastate lottery transactions via the internet if such transaction crossed state lines. In late 2011, the Office of Legal Counsel of the DOJ issued an opinion to the effect that state lottery ticket sales over the internet to in-state adults do not violate the Wire Act. The opinion provided an impetus for some states to authorize forms of interactive gaming or interactive lottery in order to generate additional revenue. However, to the extent states wish to pursue interactive gaming or interactive lottery, such states may be required or otherwise deem it advisable to enact enabling legislation or new regulations addressing the sale of lottery tickets or the offering of other forms of gaming through interactive channels, such as the actions taken by Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey to authorize various forms of internet gaming. Despite the 2011 DOJ opinion, there are still very significant forces working to limit or prohibit interactive gaming and interactive lottery in the U.S. Although these efforts have generally not been successful, there can be no assurance that laws restricting interactive gaming or interactive lottery sales will not be passed at either the federal or state level. For instance, in May 2015, the Minnesota legislature passed an amendment to the state\u2019s lottery law prohibiting the sale of instant win lottery tickets over the internet. Furthermore, changes in the executive branches of government at the state and federal level could affect federal and state\npolicies on interactive gaming and interactive lottery as well. The enactment of internet gaming legislation that federalizes significant aspects of the regulation of internet gaming and/or limits the forms of internet wagering that are permissible at the state or federal level could have an adverse impact on our ability to pursue our interactive strategy in the U.S.\nInternationally, laws relating to internet gaming are evolving, particularly in Europe. To varying degrees, a number of European governments have taken steps to change the regulation of internet wagering through the implementation of new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, including the possible imposition of sanctions on unlicensed providers. We cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any such state, federal or foreign laws and regulations, or the extent to which any such laws and regulations will facilitate or hinder our interactive strategy.\nWith respect to our social gaming business, although largely unregulated at this time, there are movements in some jurisdictions to review social gaming and possibly implement social gaming regulations. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such regulation or the extent to which they may affect our social gaming business. Both the social and RMG businesses are subject to evolving regulations and the status of any particular jurisdiction may change at any time. The regulatory structure surrounding certain aspects of these businesses is currently in flux in certain jurisdictions.\nIn jurisdictions that authorize internet gaming, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in offering our technology, content and services to internet gaming operators as we expect to face intense competition from our traditional competitors in the gaming and lottery industries as well as a number of other domestic and foreign providers (or, in some cases, the operators themselves), some of which have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience in this area than we do. In addition, there is a risk that the authorization of the sale of gaming and lottery offerings via interactive channels in a particular jurisdiction could, under certain circumstances, adversely impact our Gaming and Lottery offerings through traditional channels in such jurisdiction. Any such adverse impact would be magnified to the extent we are not involved in, and generating revenue from, the provision of interactive gaming products or services in such jurisdiction. Know-your-customer and geo-location programs and technologies supplied by third parties are an important aspect of certain internet and mobile gaming products and services because they confirm certain information with respect to players and prospective players, such as age, identity and location. Payment processing programs and technologies, typically provided by third parties, are also a necessary feature of interactive wagering products and services. These programs and technologies are costly and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of our Interactive gaming business. Additionally, there can be no assurance that products containing these programs and technologies will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they will perform accurately or otherwise in accordance with our required specifications.\nOur social gaming business is largely dependent upon our relationships with key providers and changes in those relationships could negatively impact our social gaming business.\nIn our social gaming business, our services operate largely through Facebook, Google Play for Android devices, Apple\u2019s iOS platform, Kindle's platform, Yahoos's platform and Microsoft Windows. Consequently, our expansion and prospects of our social gaming offerings are dependent on our continued relationships with these providers (and any emerging app store providers). Our relationships with Facebook, Google and Apple are not governed by contracts but rather by the provider\u2019s standard terms and conditions for application developers. Our social gaming business will be adversely impacted if we are unable to continue these relationships in the future or if the terms and conditions offered by these providers are altered to our disadvantage. For instance, if any of these providers were to increase their fees, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would suffer. Likewise, if Facebook, Google or Apple were to alter their operating platforms, we could be adversely impacted as our offerings may not be compatible with the altered platforms or may require significant and costly modifications in order to become compatible. If Facebook, Google or Apple were to develop competitive offerings, either on their own or in cooperation with one or more competitors, our growth prospects would be negatively impacted.\nWe are heavily dependent on our ability to maintain and renew our customer contracts, including our long-term lottery contracts, and we could lose substantial revenue and profits if we are unable to renew certain of our contracts on substantially similar terms or at all.\nGenerally, our Lottery contracts contain initial multi-year terms, with optional renewal periods at the discretion of the customer. Upon the expiration of any such contract, including any extensions thereof, a new contract may be awarded through a competitive bidding process. Since the beginning of 2013, we have lost lottery systems contracts in Colorado and Indiana to our competitors following the expiration or termination of our contracts. In Indiana, we will continue to provide certain services through August 2016.\nA substantial portion of our gaming revenue is dependent on repeat customers. In certain regions, our business may be concentrated with a small number of customers, such as our U.K. LBO business.\nThere can be no assurance that our current contracts will be extended or that we will be awarded new contracts as a result of competitive bidding processes or otherwise in the future. The termination, expiration or failure to renew one or more of our contracts could cause us to lose substantial revenue and profits, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to win or renew other contracts or pursue growth initiatives. There can be no assurance that new or renewed contracts will contain terms that are as favorable as our current terms or will contemplate the same scope of products and services as our current contracts and any less favorable contract terms or diminution in scope could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding the potential expiration dates of certain of our more significant Lottery contracts, see the table in \"Business-Lottery Segment-Contract Procurement\" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are also required by certain of our Lottery customers to provide surety or performance bonds in connection with our contracts. As of December 31, 2015, we had $205.2 million of outstanding performance bonds. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain surety or performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to provide such bonds would materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or obtain new, Lottery contracts.\nOur business depends on the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information and on our ability to license intellectual property from third parties.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, on protecting our intellectual property in the U.S. and in foreign countries and our ability to license intellectual property from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. Our intellectual property includes certain patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to our products and services (including gaming machines, interactive gaming products, table games, Shufflers and accessories, instant lottery games and gaming and lottery systems), as well as proprietary or confidential information that is not subject to patent or similar protection. Our success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain protection for the trademarks, names, logos or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright and patent protection for our proprietary technologies, intellectual property and innovations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to build and maintain consumer value in our trademarks, obtain patent, trademark or copyright protection or that any trademark, copyright or patent will provide us with competitive advantages. In particular, a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision tightened the standard for patent eligibility of software patents and other court decisions in recent years have trended towards a narrowing of patentable subject matter. These and similar decisions in the future may negatively impact the validity or enforceability of certain of our patents, our ability to protect our inventions, innovations and new technology and the value of our substantial patent portfolio.\nOur intellectual property protects the integrity of our games, systems, products and services. For example, our intellectual property is designed to ensure the security of the printing of our instant lottery games and to provide simple and secure validation of our lottery tickets. Competitors may independently develop similar or superior products, software or systems, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In cases where our technology or product is not protected by enforceable intellectual property rights, such independent development may result in a significant diminution in the value of such technology or product.\nWe rely on products, technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties, including licensed properties and content for our Gaming, Lottery and Interactive gaming businesses. In addition, substantially all of our gaming machines and our Interactive gaming products and services utilize intellectual property licensed from third parties and certain of the products and technologies we rely upon are licensed from our competitors. The future success of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, retain and/or expand licenses for popular technologies and games in a competitive market. There can be no assurance that these third-party licenses, or support for such licensed products and technologies, will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot renew and/or expand existing licenses, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the products that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property. Certain of our license agreements grant the licensor rights to audit our use of their intellectual property. Disputes with licensors over uses or terms could result in the payment of additional royalties or penalties by us, cancellation or non-renewal of the underlying license or litigation.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and independent contractors regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information, but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information will be honored.\nThe intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products and services, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation and litigation regarding our intellectual property could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, intellectual property, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies. If technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of others, including our competitors, we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies. If the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies, our prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that our business activities, games, products, services and systems will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us. In addition to infringement claims, third parties may allege claims of invalidity or unenforceability against us or against our licensees or manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology. A successful challenge to, or invalidation of, one of our intellectual property interests, a successful claim of infringement by a third party against us, our products or services, or one of our licensees in connection with the use of our technologies, or an unsuccessful claim of infringement made by us against a third party or its products or services could adversely affect our business or cause us financial harm. Any such claim and any resulting litigation, should it occur, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time consuming to defend or require us to pay significant amounts in damages;\n\u2022\ninvalidate our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease making, licensing or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products or services or limit our ability to bring new products and services to the market in the future;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into costly or burdensome royalty, licensing or settlement agreements in order to obtain the right to use a product, process or component;\n\u2022\nimpact the commercial viability of the products and services that are the subject of the claim during the pendency of such claim; or\n\u2022\nrequire us by way of injunction to remove products or services on lease or stop selling or leasing new products or services.\nA significant portion of our success depends on the protection of our intellectual property. We are currently making, and in the future may make, claims of infringement, invalidity or enforceability against third parties. For example, with the emergence of interactive gaming, we have increased enforcement against parties that infringe our intellectual property. This enforcement could:\n\u2022\ncause us to incur greater costs and expenses in the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\npotentially negatively impact our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncause one or more of our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property interests to be ruled or rendered unenforceable or invalid; or\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nOur business is dependent on the security and integrity of the systems and products we offer.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, on providing secure products, services and systems to our customers. Attempts to penetrate security measures may come from various combinations of customers, retailers, vendors, employees and others. Our ability to prevent anomalies and monitor and ensure the quality and integrity of our products and services is periodically reviewed and enhanced. Similarly, we regularly assess the adequacy of our security systems to protect against any\nmaterial loss to any of our customers and the integrity of our products and services to end users. Expanded utilization of the internet and other interactive technologies may result in increased security risks for us and our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by a security breach or lapse, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to avoid, detect, replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our products and services. All of our products and services are designed with security features to prevent fraudulent activity. However, we cannot guarantee that these security features will effectively stop all fraudulent activities. If our security features do not prevent fraud, we could be adversely affected.\nOur gaming machines have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past. Games and gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other gaming machine operators if they do not perform according to expectations or they may be shut down by regulators. The occurrence of anomalies in, or fraudulent manipulation of, our gaming machines or our other Gaming and Lottery products and services (including our Interactive gaming products and services), may give rise to claims from players and claims for lost revenue and profits and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by regulatory authorities, including suspension or revocation of our licenses or other disciplinary action. Additionally, in the event of the occurrence of any such issues with our products and services, substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay other projects and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems and any failures in our systems could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results.\nWe rely on information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, to manage and support our business operations and to maintain internal controls over our financial reporting. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading current systems and preventing security breaches. Among other things, our systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, break-ins, cyber-attacks, network penetration, denial of service attacks and similar events. While we have and will continue to implement network security measures and data protection safeguards, our servers and other computer systems are vulnerable to viruses, malicious software, hacking, break-ins or theft, data privacy or security breaches, third-party security breaches, employee error or malfeasance and similar events. Failures in our systems or services or unauthorized access to or tampering with our systems and databases could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any failures in our computer systems or telecommunications services could affect our ability to operate our linked games or otherwise conduct business.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could materially and adversely impact our ability to deliver products to customers and interrupt other processes. If our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time, to key decision makers, the ability to manage our business could be disrupted and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d). The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s books and records and provide information on our operations to the Company\u2019s management. The Company\u2019s ERP system implementation will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. There are inherent risks associated with upgrading or changing systems, including inaccurate data or reporting. The process of upgrading and standardizing our ERP system is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Although we believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate these risks through, among other things, testing, training and staging implementations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience data loss, disruptions, delays or negative business impacts from the upgrades. Any operational disruptions during the course of this process and any delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system or in the performance of our legacy systems could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses. Additionally, while we have spent considerable efforts to plan and budget for the implementation of the new ERP system, changes in scope, timeline or cost could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we may suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis or be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, the inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud, regardless of the adequacy of those controls. In connection with an adjustment made to the SG gaming reporting unit goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2015 and revised in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2015 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have undertaken certain measures to remediate the above-described material weakness and enhance our internal control over financial reporting. Once completed, we believe these measures will remediate the identified material weakness; however, there can be no assurance that those measures will be successful when such measures are tested in connection with our regular impairment testing during 2016. There also can be no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Please refer to Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d and Note 25 (Selected Quarterly Financial Data, Unaudited) for additional information.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers, suppliers or regulators operate.\nWe may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, suppliers, data service providers and regulators. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers\u2019 facilities may impair or delay delivery of our products and services. Additionally, disruptions experienced by our regulators due to natural disasters or otherwise could delay our introduction of new products or entry into new jurisdictions where regulatory approval is necessary. While we insure against certain business interruption risks, we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. Any serious disruption to our operations, or those of our customers, our suppliers or our regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may not succeed in realizing the anticipated benefits of our strategic equity investments and relationships.\nUnder certain circumstances we pursue growth through strategic equity investments, including joint ventures, as a means to, among other things, gain access to new and important geographies, business opportunities and technical expertise, while simultaneously offering the potential for reducing capital requirements.\nThese strategic equity investments currently include investments in LNS, Northstar Illinois, Northstar New Jersey, Hellenic Lotteries, GLB and ITL. For additional information regarding our equity investments, see Note 11 (Equity Investments).\nNorthstar New Jersey is responsible for payments to the State of New Jersey to the extent certain net income targets are not achieved by the New Jersey Lottery, subject to a cap of 2% of the applicable year\u2019s net income and a $20.0 million shortfall payment credit that was fully utilized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, pursuant to a December 2015 amendment to the Northstar New Jersey services agreement, the State will be entitled to additional amounts for each of the lottery\u2019s 2016-2018 fiscal years to the extent the sum of the New Jersey Lottery\u2019s net income and the net income shortfall payments paid to the State by Northstar New Jersey (if any) for the applicable year fall below certain guaranteed amounts. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition from our equity investment in Northstar New Jersey may be impacted to the extent the New Jersey Lottery achieves, or fails to achieve, the applicable net income targets and will be impacted to the extent Northstar New Jersey incurs non-reimbursable expenses. We may be required to make capital contributions to Northstar New Jersey to fund our pro rata share of any net income shortfall payments that are payable to the State under our agreements. In December 2015, pursuant to the terms the amendment to its services agreement, (i) Northstar New Jersey made a $15.4 million payment to the State, of which we contributed our pro rata portion of $2.7 million, representing consideration in connection with the terms and conditions of the amendment and (ii) Northstar New Jersey satisfied the $5.9 million net income shortfall payment owed to the State for the lottery\u2019s fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 with the remainder of the $20.0 million shortfall payment credit.\nUnder the Northstar New Jersey services agreement, New Jersey has certain termination rights, including the right to terminate the agreement for convenience (subject to payment of a termination fee) and the right to terminate the agreement in the event net income shortfalls exceeding 10% of the applicable targets occur for any consecutive two contract year period or for any three contract years in a five contract year period.\nUnder the terms of a PMA, Northstar Illinois is entitled to receive annual incentive compensation payments from the Illinois Department of the Lottery (the \u201cIllinois Lottery\u201d) to the extent it is successful in increasing the Illinois Lottery's net income above specified target levels, subject to a cap of 5% of the applicable year's net income, and is responsible for annual shortfall payments to the Illinois Lottery to the extent such targets are not achieved, subject to a similar cap.\nIn August 2015, Northstar Illinois, the State of Illinois, SGI and Gtech Corporation (\u201cGtech\u201d) entered into a termination agreement with respect to the PMA. The termination agreement contemplates, among other things, (1) a $10.0 million net income shortfall payment for the lottery\u2019s 2015 fiscal year, (2) termination of the PMA in January 2017 (subject to possible extension by mutual agreement of the State of Illinois and Northstar Illinois in 3- to 6-month increments), (3) that, following December 2014, Northstar Illinois will no longer be entitled to any incentive compensation payments and will no longer be liable for any additional shortfall payments, after the $10.0 million net income shortfall payment previously discussed is paid by Northstar Illinois, (4) reimbursement of Northstar Illinois for certain costs it incurs in transitioning its obligations under the PMA, (5) continuation of our instant lottery game supply agreement (and Gtech\u2019s lottery systems supply agreement) with Northstar Illinois until July 2017, subject to a reduced rate structure and (6) our right to negotiate a new supply agreement with any manager that replaces Northstar Illinois and our ability to participate in the procurement process for such replacement manager. As of December 31, 2015, we had accounts receivable of $27.6 million from Northstar Illinois.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of these strategic equity investments and relationships and other strategic investments and relationships that we may make or enter into, or may not realize them in the timeframes expected. These arrangements pose significant risks that could have a negative effect on our operations, including: the potential diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our core business; the potential failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other value associated with these arrangements; unanticipated costs and other unanticipated events or circumstances, including losses for which we may be responsible for our pro rata portion; possible adverse effects on our operating results during any integration process; impairment charges if our strategic equity investments or relationships are not as successful as we originally anticipate; and our potential inability to achieve the intended objectives of these arrangements.\nFurthermore, our strategic equity investments and other strategic relationships pose risks arising from our reliance on our partners and our lack of sole decision-making authority, which may give rise to disputes between us and our partners. For instance, our investments in LNS, Northstar Illinois and Northstar New Jersey are minority investments in ventures whose largest equity holder is Gtech and, although certain corporate actions require our prior consent, we do not unilaterally control decisions relating to the governance of these entities. We are party to strategic agreements with a subsidiary of Playtech Limited relating to gaming machines that contemplate our license of, and reliance on, the subsidiary\u2019s back-end technology platform in certain jurisdictions, particularly in the U.K. Our equity partners, licensors and other third parties with which we have strategic relationships may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests and goals, take actions contrary to our objectives or policies, undergo a change of control, experience financial and other difficulties or be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under our arrangements.\nIn certain regions, we enter into agreements with local distributors for the distribution of our land-based gaming products to one or more customers. Changes to these distributor relationships, including modification or termination of our agreements or difficulties with any such distributor could prevent us from delivering products or services to our customers on a timely basis, or at all, and could negatively impact our business.\nThe failure to avoid or mitigate the risks described above or other risks associated with such arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur inability to complete future acquisitions and integrate those businesses successfully could limit our future growth.\nFrom time to time, we pursue strategic acquisitions in support of our strategic goals. In connection with any such acquisitions, we could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations, including acquired assets, operations and personnel. There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions. Our ability to succeed in implementing our strategy will depend to some degree upon the ability of our management to identify, complete and successfully integrate commercially viable acquisitions. Acquisition transactions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management from other responsibilities.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of our recent acquisitions or such acquisitions may disrupt our current plans and operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired, including our recent acquisitions of Bally and WMS, or do so within the intended timeframes or otherwise realize the expected benefits\nof such acquisitions. The expected cost synergies associated with such acquisitions may not be fully realized in the anticipated amounts or within the contemplated timeframes or cost expectations, which could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our businesses may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations. The integration of these acquisitions will require significant time and focus from management and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined business or delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We expect to incur incremental costs and capital expenditures related to our contemplated integration activities.\nWe may incur additional restructuring costs.\nWe have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is possible that we may engage in additional restructuring initiatives in the future. Restructuring initiatives are primarily driven by acquisitions or other Company reorganizations in an attempt to maximize the efficiency and profitability of our businesses and can result in employee termination and severance costs, facility closure expenses, and/or write-downs of property, equipment or other assets. Because we are not able to predict with certainty when we will complete acquisitions or reorganize portions of our business, we cannot predict the extent, timing and magnitude of restructuring charges.\nOur products and services may be subject to complex revenue recognition standards, which could materially affect our financial results.\nAs we introduce new Gaming, Lottery and Interactive gaming products and services and as our commercial transactions become increasingly complex, additional analysis and judgment is required to account for them and to recognize revenue in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We may enter into transactions that include multiple-element arrangements and/or software components and applicable accounting principles or regulatory product approval delays could change when we recognize revenue with respect to such transactions and could adversely affect our financial results for any given period. In addition, fluctuations may occur in our revenue and related deferred revenue as a result of multiple-element arrangements that include both systems and software. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates- Revenue recognition\" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 (Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for additional information.\nWe may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.\nWe assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets as and when required by U.S. GAAP to\ndetermine whether they are impaired. Based on the results of our interim and annual goodwill and other intangible assets\nimpairment tests we conducted during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded total goodwill and trade name asset\nimpairment charges of $1,002.6 million and $128.6 million, respectively. During 2015, we recorded a $935.0 million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our SG gaming reporting unit goodwill to its implied fair value. This goodwill impairment charge reflects a $400.0 million revision to the $535.0 million charge previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015. We also recorded a $67.6 million non-cash impairment charge, which resulted in a tax benefit of $24.9 million, to write off the recorded amount of our U.S. lottery systems reporting unit goodwill. For additional information, including a description of all impairments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Valuation of investments, long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill\" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Note 9 (Intangible Assets, net and Goodwill) and Note 25 (Selected Quarterly Financial Data, Unaudited). We cannot predict the occurrence of impairments and there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nOur results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance.\nOur results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer, while revenue from our Participation gaming machines is generally strongest in the spring and summer. Certain other seasonal trends and factors that may cause our results to fluctuate include: the geographies where we operate; holiday and vacation seasons; climate; weather; economic and political conditions; timing of the release of new products; significant equipment sales or the introduction of gaming or lottery activities in new jurisdictions or to new customers; the size and duration of draw lottery game jackpots; and other factors.\nIn light of the foregoing, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in another quarter or for the full fiscal year. There can be no assurance that the seasonal trends and other factors that have impacted our historical results will repeat in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or lose customers.\nOur production of instant lottery games, in particular, depends upon a continuous supply of raw materials, supplies, power and natural resources. Our operating results could be adversely affected by an interruption or cessation in the supply of these items or a serious quality assurance lapse, including as a result of the insolvency of any of our key suppliers.\nSimilarly, the operation of our instant ticket printing presses and the manufacture and maintenance of our gaming machines and gaming and lottery systems are dependent upon a regular and continuous supply of raw materials and components, many of which are manufactured or produced outside of the U.S. Certain of the components we use are customized for our products. The assembly of certain of our products and other hardware is performed by third parties. Any interruption or cessation in the supply of these items or services or any material quality assurance lapse with respect thereto could materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may be unable to find adequate replacements for our suppliers within a reasonable time frame, on favorable commercial terms or at all. The impact of the foregoing may be magnified as we continue to seek to streamline our gaming supply chain by reducing the number of our suppliers. Further, manufacturing costs may unexpectedly increase and we may not be able to successfully recover any or all of such cost increases.\nIn our lottery systems business, we transmit certain wagering data utilizing satellite transponders, generally pursuant to long-term contracts. The technical failure of any of these satellites would require us to obtain other communication services, including other satellite access. In some cases, we employ backup systems to limit our exposure in the event of such a failure. There can be no assurance of access to such other satellites or, if available, the ability to obtain the use of such other satellites on favorable terms or in a timely manner. While satellite failures are infrequent, the operation of satellites is outside of our control.\nIn addition, in our Gaming business, we rely upon a number of significant third-party suppliers and vendors delivering parts, equipment and services on schedule in order for us to meet our contractual commitments. Furthermore, we outsource the manufacturing of certain of our sub-assemblies to third parties in the United States, Europe, Central America and Asia. Failure of these third parties to meet their delivery commitments could result in us being in breach of, and subsequently losing, the affected customer orders, which loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Certain of our products are reliant on network and/or telecommunications services. For instance, any disruption to our network or telecommunications could impact our linked or networked games, which could reduce our revenue.\nIn our Interactive gaming business, we often rely on third-party data center providers to, among other things, host our remote game servers. Our Interactive gaming businesses would be adversely impacted to the extent any such data center provider was unable or unwilling to continue to provide services to us.\nWe have foreign operations, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks.\nWe are a global business and derive a substantial portion of our revenue and profits from operations outside of the United States. Additionally, the success of our strategic initiatives is dependent upon expansion of our operations outside of the United States. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 22% of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States. Our consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate exposures arise from current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and from the translation of foreign currency denominated balance sheet accounts into U.S. dollar-denominated balance sheet accounts. We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because portions of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly the British Pound Sterling, the Australian dollar and the Euro. In particular, uncertainty regarding economic conditions in Europe and the debt crisis affecting certain countries in the EU pose risk to the stability of the Euro. Exchange rate fluctuations have in the past adversely affected our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the value of our assets outside the U.S. in the future. If a foreign currency is devalued in a jurisdiction in which we are paid in such currency, we may require our customers to pay higher amounts for our products, which they may be unable or unwilling to pay.\nFrom time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward or other hedging contracts. We are subject to the risk that a counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contracts. During an economic downturn, a counterparty\u2019s financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure. In the event of a counterparty default, we could lose the benefit of our hedging contract, which may harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to eventually recover any benefit lost as a result of that counterparty\u2019s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty.\nForeign governments can impose restrictions on currency movements that may make it costly or impossible to transfer money to the U.S. Additionally, foreign governments may limit or prevent our ability to import our products and services into foreign jurisdictions. In 2012, governmental authorities in Argentina modified regulations relating to importing products and limiting the exchange of pesos into U.S. dollars and the transfer of funds from Argentina. While the Argentine government\u2019s restrictions on currency transfer were recently lifted, any reinstatement of such restrictions would increase our exposure to any potential currency devaluation in Argentina. Currently, our legal entities in Argentina cannot directly import certain of our gaming products and, if the import regulations remain unchanged or if we are unable to continue to import certain of our products into Argentina, our revenue from customers in Argentina will be negatively impacted, as occurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Business Segments Results-Gaming-Current Year Update.\"\nOur operations in foreign jurisdictions subject us to additional risks customarily associated with such operations, including: the complexity of foreign laws, regulations and markets; the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions; the impact of foreign labor laws and disputes; the economic, tax and regulatory policies of local governments; compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws; and the ability to attract and retain key personnel in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our international business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by terrorist activity, political unrest or other economic or political uncertainties. For example, recent government actions and challenges affecting the gaming industry in Mexico have increased the credit quality risk with respect to certain of our current Mexico customers. In addition, foreign jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our international sales.\nAs a significant amount of our profits and cash flows are generated outside the U.S., the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations, such as us, are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such laws, certain of the proposed changes, such as those seeking to limit the deferral of taxes, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdditionally, foreign taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees on their earnings may not be recovered against our U.S. tax liability. At December 31, 2015, we had a deferred tax asset for our foreign tax credit carry forward of $19.4 million. Although we will continue to explore tax planning strategies to use all of our foreign tax credit carry forward, at December 31, 2015, we had a valuation allowance of $12.7 million against the foreign tax credit deferred tax asset to reduce the asset to the net amount that our management estimates is \"more likely than not\" to be realized.\nIn addition, our ability to expand successfully in foreign jurisdictions involves other risks, including difficulties in integrating foreign operations, risks associated with entering jurisdictions in which we may have little experience and the day-to-day management of a growing and increasingly geographically diverse company. Our investment in foreign jurisdictions often entails entering into joint ventures or other business relationships with locally based entities, which can involve additional risks arising from our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a partner\u2019s financial condition, inconsistency between our business interests or goals and those of our partners and disputes between us and our partners.\nWe have Lottery-related investments and business operations in China, including through our joint ventures. Our business in, and results of operations from, China are subject to a number of risks relating to China, including risks relating to competition, the bidding and contract negotiation processes, our ability to finance or refinance our operations, the complex regulatory environment (including currency and money transfer restrictions), our ability to receive timely product approvals, the political climate, the economy and our joint venture and other business partners in China.\nWe may not realize the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions and our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with our operations in foreign\njurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our key employees.\nWe depend on the continued performance of our executive officers and key personnel, including M. Gavin Isaacs, our president and chief executive officer. If we lose the services of any of our executive officers or key personnel and cannot find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner, it could have an adverse impact on our business. Our ability to expand is dependent on our ability to recruit and retain talented employees in the U.S. and internationally who are capable of leading our employees to achieve our strategic objectives.\nWe also rely on our highly skilled, technically trained and creative employees to develop new technologies and create innovative products. A lack of skilled technical workers could delay or negatively impact our business plans, ability to compete, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe could incur costs in the event of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws.\nOur operations and real property are subject to U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur costs, including cleanup costs, fines or penalties, and third-party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent or reduce environmental pollution, and these permits are subject to review, renewal and modification by issuing authorities.\nFailure to perform under our Gaming and Lottery contracts may result in litigation, substantial monetary liquidated damages and contract termination.\nOur business subjects us to contract penalties and risks of litigation, including potential allegations that we have not fully performed under our contracts or that goods or services we supply are defective in some respect. Litigation is pending in Colombia arising out of the termination of certain Colombian lottery contracts in 1993. An agency of the Colombian government has asserted claims against certain parties, including the Company, which owned a minority interest in Wintech de Colombia S.A., or Wintech (now liquidated), the former operator of the Colombian national lottery. The claims are for, among other things, contract penalties, interest and the amount of a bond issued by a Colombian surety. For additional information regarding this or other litigations, see \"Legal Proceedings\" in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that this litigation will not be finally resolved adversely to us or result in material liability.\nIn addition, our Lottery contracts, including our contracts relating to the provision of VLTs, typically permit a lottery authority to terminate the contract at any time for a material failure to perform, other specified reasons and, in many cases, for no reason at all. Upon such a termination or failure to perform, we may be required to refund fees paid to us for services performed or allow our Lottery customers to return our products to us for a full refund. Lottery contracts to which we are a party also frequently contain exacting implementation schedules and performance requirements and the failure to meet these schedules and requirements may result in substantial monetary liquidated damages, as well as possible contract termination. We are also required by certain of our Lottery customers to provide surety or performance bonds. We have paid or incurred liquidated damages and have been required to allow the return of VLTs for a full refund under our Lottery contracts and material amounts of liquidated damages could be imposed on us in the future, which could, if imposed, have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may be liable for product defects or other claims relating to our products.\nOur products could be defective, fail to perform as designed or otherwise cause harm to our customers, their equipment or their products. If any of our products are defective, we may be required to recall the products and/or repair or replace them, which could result in substantial expenses and affect our profitability. Any problem with the performance of our products, such as an instant lottery game misprint or false jackpot or other prize, could harm our reputation, which could result in a loss of sales to customers and/or potential customers. In addition, the occurrence of errors in, or fraudulent manipulation of, our products or software may give rise to claims by our customers or by our customers\u2019 patrons, including claims by our customers for lost revenues and related litigation that could result in significant liability. Any claims brought against us by customers may result in diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees and payment of damages, lower demand for our products or services, or injury to our reputation. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover a judgment against us or a settlement payment and is subject to customary deductibles, limits and exclusions. In addition, a judgment against us or a settlement could make it difficult for us to obtain insurance in the coverage amounts necessary to\nadequately insure our businesses, or at all, and could materially increase our insurance premiums and deductibles. In addition, software bugs or malfunctions, errors in distribution or installation of our software, failure of our products to perform as approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies or other errors or malfunctions, may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities, including fines.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to litigation claims in the operation of our business, including, but not limited to, with respect to employee matters, alleged product and system malfunctions, alleged intellectual property infringement and claims relating to our contracts, licenses and strategic investments. We may incur significant expense defending or settling any such litigation. Additionally, adverse judgments that may be decided against us could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nLabor disputes and union organizing activities may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nCertain of our employees are represented by unions or works councils, including employees in Europe, South America and Canada. In particular, the majority of our employees at our printing facilities in the U.K., Chile and Quebec and a small number of employees in the U.S. are represented by unions. While we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot predict whether we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without any disruptions in our operations or higher labor costs. Any disruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not encounter conflicts or strikes with any labor unions that represent our employees or union organizing activities at our non-unionized facilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition or our customers\u2019 operations, could cause us to lose customers, or could increase our labor costs.\nRisks Relating to our Capital Structure\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness of $8,207.0 million, consisting primarily of borrowings under our credit agreement, Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes, net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs.\nOur level of indebtedness could affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness; require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry or competitive developments or conditions; and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate or in pursuing our strategic objectives. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of higher interest rates as a significant portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest. If interest rates increase, the interest payment obligations under our non-hedged variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be negatively impacted. All of these factors could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have less debt than we do.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit agreement to finance required capital expenditures under new contracts and meet our other cash needs. These obligations require a significant amount of cash.\nOur Gaming Participation and lottery systems businesses generally require significant upfront capital expenditures for gaming machine or lottery terminal assembly, software customization and implementation, systems and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration. In connection with a renewal or bid of a gaming machine or lottery systems contract, a customer may seek to obtain new equipment or impose new service requirements, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to retain or win the contract. Historically, we have funded these upfront costs through cash flows generated from operations, available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement. In addition, we have seen an increase in lottery RFPs, some involving private management agreements, which include economic terms that expose the Company to increased risk, such as requiring the guarantee of specific income thresholds or significant upfront payments. Our\nability to generate revenue and to continue to procure new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms.\nIf we do not have adequate liquidity or are unable to obtain financing for these upfront costs and our other cash needs on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to bid on certain contracts, which could result in our losing business or could restrict our ability to grow which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Moreover, we may not realize the return on investment that we anticipate on new or renewed contracts due to a variety of factors, including lower than anticipated retail sales or amounts wagered, higher than anticipated capital or operating expenses and unanticipated regulatory developments or litigation. We may not have adequate liquidity to pursue other aspects of our strategy, including bringing our products and services to new customers or new or underpenetrated geographies (including through equity investments) or pursuing strategic acquisitions. In the event we pursue significant acquisitions or other expansion opportunities, conduct significant repurchases of our outstanding securities, or refinance or repay existing debt, we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings under our existing financing arrangements, which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other obligations depends on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, which in turn are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness as well as our other obligations.\nWe are required to make scheduled payments of principal on the term loans borrowed under our credit agreement, and our credit agreement requires that a portion of our excess cash flow be applied to prepay amounts borrowed under our credit agreement. We may also, from time to time, repurchase, or otherwise retire or refinance our debt, through our subsidiaries or otherwise. Such activities, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may or may not be material. If we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or before maturity, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur lenders, including the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement, may become insolvent or tighten their lending standards, which could make it more difficult for us to borrow under our revolving credit facility or to obtain other financing on favorable terms or at all. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected if we were unable to draw funds under our revolving credit facility because of a lender default or to obtain other cost-effective financing. Any default by a lender in its obligation to fund its commitment under our revolving credit facility (or its participation in letters of credit) could limit our liquidity to the extent of the defaulting lender\u2019s commitment. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to meet our commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these actions could be completed on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our requirements. Moreover, our existing debt agreements contain, and our future debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nAgreements governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness. Were this to occur, we would not have sufficient cash to pay our accelerated indebtedness.\nAgreements governing our indebtedness, including our credit agreement and the indentures governing our Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes, impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities that may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in new business activities. In some cases, these restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. Subject to certain exceptions, our credit facilities and/or indentures restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase other debt;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into arrangements that would prohibit us from granting liens or restrict our ability to pay dividends, make loans or transfer assets among our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nalter the business we conduct.\nIn addition, our credit agreement contains a covenant that is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires us to not exceed a maximum consolidated net first lien leverage ratio of 5.75x Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), with this ratio stepping down to 5.5x for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and 5.0x for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and other agreements containing cross-default provisions and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these obligations or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nCertain holders of our common stock exert significant influence over the Company and may make decisions that conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nIn August 2004, MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (formerly known as MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc.) was issued approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock in connection with its conversion of our then outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. According to a Form 4 filed with the SEC on November 24, 2015, this holder beneficially owns 34,575,737 shares of our common stock, or approximately 40.0% of our outstanding common stock as of February 22, 2016. Pursuant to a stockholders\u2019 agreement with us, which we originally entered into with holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, such holder is entitled to appoint up to four members of our board of directors and certain actions of our Company require the approval of such holder. As a result, this holder has the ability to exert significant influence over our business and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree, including, among other things, delaying, discouraging or preventing a change of control of our Company or a potential merger, consolidation, tender offer, takeover or other business combination.", "PERMNO": 79338, "SIC": 3570, "TIC": "SGMS"}
