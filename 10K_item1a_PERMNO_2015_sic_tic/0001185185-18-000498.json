{"cik": "1236275", "company": "SilverSun Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe have a large accumulated deficit, may incur future losses and may be unable to maintain profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $7,692,242 and $7,205,773, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 we had stockholders\u2019 equity of $4,227,121 and $4,970,916 respectively. We may incur net losses in the future. Our ability to achieve and sustain long-term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services, control our costs, and effectively manage our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain profitability. In the event we fail to maintain profitability, our stock price could decline.\nWe cannot accurately forecast our future revenues and operating results, which may fluctuate.\nOur operating history and the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results. Furthermore, we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of sales of our products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of product implementation, particularly large design projects;\n\u00b7\nunexpected delays in introducing new products and services;\n\u00b7\nincreased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, product development, or administration;\n\u00b7\nthe mix of product license and services revenue; and\n\u00b7\ncosts related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses.\nWe may fail to develop new products, or may incur unexpected expenses or delays.\nAlthough we currently have fully developed products available for sale, we may need to develop various new technologies, products and product features and to remain competitive. Due to the risks inherent in developing new products and technologies - limited financing, loss of key personnel, and other factors - we may fail to develop these technologies and products, or may experience lengthy and costly delays in doing so. Although we are able to license some of our technologies in their current stage of development, we cannot assure that we will be able to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products in order to remain competitive.\nWe may need additional financing which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, as needed, the future growth of our business and operations could be severely limited.\nA limiting factor on our growth is our limited capitalization, which could impact our ability to execute on our business plan. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of the Company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and our shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our Common Stock. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt or other equity instruments, we may become subject to certain operational limitations (for example, negative operating covenants). There can be no assurance that acceptable financing necessary to further implement our business plan can be obtained on suitable terms, if at all. Our ability to develop our business, fund expansion, develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, could suffer if we are unable to raise the additional funds on acceptable terms, which would have the effect of limiting our ability to increase our revenues or possibly attain profitable operations in the future.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to reduce probability of fraud occurrence. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed.\nManagement has concluded that the Company did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the criteria set forth in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.\nWe may fail to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nWe expect to rapidly expand our operations and grow our sales, development and administrative operations. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, particularly sales, marketing and managed services. If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our marketing and managed services activities and service our clients\u2019 needs, and this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIf our technologies and products contain defects or otherwise do not work as expected, we may incur significant expenses in attempting to correct these defects or in defending lawsuits over any such defects.\nSoftware products are not currently accurate in every instance, and may never be. Furthermore, we could inadvertently release products and technologies that contain defects. In addition, third-party technology that we include in our products could contain defects. We may incur significant expenses to correct such defects. Clients who are not satisfied with our products or services could bring claims against us for substantial damages. Such claims could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and, if successful, could result in the plaintiffs being awarded significant damages. Our payment of any such expenses or damages could prevent us from becoming profitable.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to compete against competitors that have significantly greater resources than we have.\nThe ERP software, EDI software, MSP and business consulting industries are highly competitive, and we believe that this competition will intensify. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and larger client bases than we do. Our competitors could use these resources to market or develop products or services that are more effective or less costly than any or all of our products or services or that could render any or all of our products or services obsolete. Our competitors could also use their economic strength to influence the market to continue to buy their existing products.\nIf we are not able to protect our trade secrets through enforcement of our confidentiality and non-competition agreements, then we may not be able to compete effectively and we may not be profitable.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets, including the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our technologies, through the use of confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements with our current employees and with other parties to whom we have divulged such trade secrets. If the employees or other parties breach our confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect our technology or are found to be unenforceable, our competitors could acquire and use information that we consider to be our trade secrets and we may not be able to compete effectively. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and manufacturing resources than we have, and we may not be profitable if our competitors are also able to take advantage of our trade secrets.\nOur failure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nOur trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdictions where we may file may be denied, and we may not be able to maintain or enforce our registered trademarks. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, with respect to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and any corresponding foreign agencies, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our applications and/or registrations, and our applications and/or registrations may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nWe may unintentionally infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nMany lawsuits currently are being brought in the software industry alleging violation of intellectual property rights. Although we do not believe that we are infringing on any patent rights, patent holders may claim that we are doing so. Any such claim would likely be time-consuming and expensive to defend, particularly if we are unsuccessful, and could prevent us from selling our products or services. In addition, we may also be forced to enter into costly and burdensome royalty and licensing agreements.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change and failure to adapt our product development to these changes may cause our products to become obsolete.\nWe participate in a highly dynamic industry characterized by rapid change and uncertainty relating to new and emerging technologies and markets. Future technology or market changes may cause some of our products to become obsolete more quickly than expected.\nThe trend toward consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively.\nAs consolidation in the software industry continues, fewer companies dominate particular markets, changing the nature of the market and potentially providing consumers with fewer choices. Also, many of these companies offer a broader range of products than us, ranging from desktop to enterprise solutions. We may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors. Furthermore, we may use strategic acquisitions, as necessary, to acquire technology, people and products for our overall product strategy. The trend toward consolidation in our industry may result in increased competition in acquiring these technologies, people or products, resulting in increased acquisition costs or the inability to acquire the desired technologies, people or products. Any of these changes may have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results.\nWe face intense price-based competition for licensing of our products which could reduce profit margins.\nPrice competition is often intense in the software market. Price competition may continue to increase and become even more significant in the future, resulting in reduced profit margins.\nThe software and technology industry is highly competitive. If we cannot develop and market desirable products that the public is willing to purchase, we will not be able to compete successfully. Our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to generate any revenues.\nWe have many potential competitors in the software industry. We consider the competition to be competent, experienced, and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development, sales, and marketing of their products than are available to us. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors, also, offer a wider range of software products, have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases than the Company. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, customer desires, as well as undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer terms that are more attractive to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the Company. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors or that the competitive pressure we may encounter will not force us to cease operations.\nIf there are events or circumstances affecting the reliability or security of the internet, access to our website and/or the ability to safeguard confidential information could be impaired causing a negative effect on the financial results of our business operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our website infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, hacking or similar disruptive problems caused by members, other internet users, other connected internet sites, and the interconnecting telecommunications networks. Such problems caused by third-parties could lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers. Inappropriate use of the internet by third-parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer system, which may deter individuals from becoming customers. Such inappropriate use of the internet includes attempting to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, which is commonly known as \u201ccracking\u201d or \u201chacking.\u201d Although we have implemented security measures, such measures have been circumvented in the past by hackers on other websites on the internet, although our networks have never been breached, and there can be no assurance that any measures we implement would not be circumvented in future. Dealing with problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may require interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key personnel our business may suffer.\nWe are dependent on Mark Meller, our Chief Executive Officer and other key employees in our operating subsidiary SWK. The loss of any of our key personnel could materially harm our business because of the cost and time necessary to retain and train a replacement. Such a loss would also divert management attention away from operational issues.\nTo service our debt obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Any failure to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it matures, could materially adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and repay or refinance our maturing indebtedness will depend principally upon our future operating performance.\nAs a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our debt and comply with the covenants of the line of credit. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, incurring additional debt, issuing equity or convertible securities, utilizing our line of credit, reducing discretionary expenditures and selling certain assets (or combinations thereof). Our ability to execute such alternative financing plans will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, our ability to execute such alternative financing plans may be subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, including our revolving credit facility and our term loan. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants compared to those associated with any debt that is being refinanced, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or our inability to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related To Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nvariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u25cf\nissuances of new stock which dilutes earnings per share;\n\u25cf\nforward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share;\n\u25cf\nthe net increases in the number of customers and paying subscriptions, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ntrading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industries even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are to become the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe currently have a limited trading volume, which results in higher price volatility for, and reduced liquidity of, our common stock.\nThere has been limited trading of our common stock since we began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market in April 2017, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a smaller reporting company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even in the event that we come to the attention of such persons, they would likely be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value. Also, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as is currently the case, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. A broader or more active public trading market for our common shares may not develop or if developed, may not be sustained. Due to these conditions, you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nThe ownership by our Chief Executive Officer of Series B Preferred Stock will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nMr. Mark Meller, our chief executive officer, is the beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock. On July 28, 2016 the Company entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark Meller, pursuant to which Mr. Meller was issued the only share of the Company\u2019s authorized but unissued Series B Preferred Stock. Mr. Meller was issued one (1) share of Series B Preferred Stock for (i) $100 in cash and (ii) as partial consideration for Mr. Meller\u2019s personal guarantee of the Revolving Demand Note. One (1) share of the Series B Preferred Stock has voting rights equal to (x) the total issued and outstanding Common Stock eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote divided by (y) forty-nine one-hundredths (0.49) minus (z) the total issued and outstanding Common Stock eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote. For the avoidance of doubt, if the total issued and outstanding Common Stock eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote is 5,000,000, the voting rights of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be equal to 5,204,082 (e.g. (5,000,000 / 0.49) - 5,000,000 = 5,204,082). The Series B Preferred Stock has the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions set for in the Certificate of Designation filed by the Corporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 23, 2011. As a result, our chief executive officer would have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. In addition, Mr. Meller beneficially owns approximately 44.6% of our issued and outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nAlthough our shares have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our shares may be subject to potential delisting if we do not meet or continue to maintain the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOur shares have been approved for and currently trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d)\u037e however Nasdaq has rules for continued listing, including, without limitation, minimum market capitalization and other requirements. Failure to maintain our listing, or delisting from Nasdaq, would make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of our common stock and more difficult to obtain accurate price quotations on our common stock. This could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in the future, may also be materially and adversely affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange.\nIn order to raise sufficient funds to expand our operations, we may have to issue additional securities at prices which may result in substantial dilution to our shareholders.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt, our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our common shares outstanding. We may also have to issue securities that may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock.\nPossible adverse effect of issuance of preferred stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which all shares are available for issuance, with designations, rights and preferences as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. As a result of the foregoing, the Board of Directors can issue, without further shareholder approval, preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of Common Stock. The issuance of preferred stock could, under certain circumstances, discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nOur stock price could fall and we could be delisted from the NASDAQ in which case U.S. Broker-Dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock because they may be considered penny stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules.\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our securities have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to SEC, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.", "PERMNO": 16680, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SSNT"}
