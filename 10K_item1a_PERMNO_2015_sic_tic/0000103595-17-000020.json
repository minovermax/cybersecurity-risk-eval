{"cik": "103595", "company": "VILLAGE SUPER MARKET INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-10-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\nThe supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins. Results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs, industry consolidation and competitor store openings. Village competes directly with multiple retail formats both in-store and online, including national, regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general merchandise stores, fast food chains, restaurants, dollar stores and convenience stores. Some of the Company's principal competitors include Acme, Aldi, Amazon, BJs, Costco, Foodtown, Giant, Kings, Safeway, Stop & Shop, Target, Wal-Mart, Wegmans, Weis and Whole Foods. Competition with\nthese outlets is based on price, store location, convenience, promotion, product assortment, quality and service. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do.\nGEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION AND MARKET CONDITIONS\nThe Company\u2019s stores are concentrated in New Jersey, with two stores in Maryland and one in northeastern Pennsylvania. We are vulnerable to economic downturns in New Jersey in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole. Economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rate fluctuations, movements in energy costs, social programs, minimum wage legislation, unemployment rates and changing demographics may adversely affect our sales and profits. Further, since our store base is concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas, opportunities for future store expansion may be limited, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWAKEFERN RELATIONSHIP\nVillage purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. In addition, Wakefern provides the Company with support services in numerous areas including advertising, liability and property insurance, supplies, certain equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain financial accounting applications, retail technology support, and other store services. Further, Village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from Wakefern.\nAny material change in Wakefern\u2019s method of operation or a termination or material modification of Village\u2019s relationship with Wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business and could involve additional expense for Village. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to Wakefern or a member\u2019s insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in increased costs to the Company. Additionally, an adverse change in Wakefern\u2019s results of operations could have an adverse effect on Village\u2019s results of operations.\nLABOR RELATIONS\nApproximately 91% of the Company\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. Contracts with the Company\u2019s seven unions have expiration dates between July 2017 and July 2021. Approximately 6% of our associates are represented by unions whose contracts have expired or will expire within one year. In future negotiations with labor unions, we expect that rising health care and pension costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics for negotiation. Upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions. This could significantly disrupt our operations or have an adverse impact on our financial results. Further, if we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFOOD SAFETY\nThe Company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, could discourage consumers from buying our products. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations.\nMULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS\nThe Company is required to make contributions to multi-employer pension plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits generally are based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Based on the most recent information available to us, certain of these multi-employer plans are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of an employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to our participation in multi-employer pension plans.\nINSURANCE\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, property, director and officers\u2019 liability, and certain employee health care benefits. Any projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and insolvency of insurance carriers could all affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nOur long-lived assets, primarily store property, equipment and fixtures, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure of our asset groups to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets.\nTAXES\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nWakefern provides all members of the cooperative with information system support that enables us to effectively manage our business data, customer transactions, inventory management, communications and other business processes. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and related malicious software, catastrophic weather events, or human error. Any material interruption of our or Wakefern\u2019s information systems could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDue to the nature of our business, personal information about our customers, vendors and associates is received and stored in these information systems. In addition, confidential information is transmitted through our ShopRite from Home online business at shoprite.com and through the ShopRite app. Unauthorized parties may attempt to access information stored in or to sabotage or disrupt these systems. Wakefern and the Company maintain substantial security measures to prevent and detect unauthorized access to such information, including utilizing third-party service providers for monitoring our networks, security reviews, and other functions. It is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may be able to defeat the security measures in place at the Company, Wakefern or those of third-party service providers.\nAny breach of these security measures and loss of confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, could damage our reputation with customers, vendors and associates, cause Wakefern and Village to incur significant costs to protect any customers, vendors and associates whose personal data was compromised, cause us to make changes to our information systems and could result in government enforcement actions and litigation against Wakefern and Village from outside parties. Any such breach could have a material adverse impact on our operations, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity if the related costs to Wakefern and Village are not covered by or are in excess of carried insurance policies. In addition, a security breach could require Wakefern and Village to devote significant management resources to address problems created by the security breach and restore our reputation.", "PERMNO": 80857, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "VLGEA"}
