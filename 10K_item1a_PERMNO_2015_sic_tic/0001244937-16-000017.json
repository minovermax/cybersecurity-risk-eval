The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements under Section 21E of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by terminology such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking\nstatements. Actual events or results may differ materially. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below and in our other filings with the SEC. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur future profitability is uncertain and we may incur net losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $254.3 million. Although we achieved profitability for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2010, with net income of $12.1 million, $22.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, we incurred net losses for all other fiscal years since our inception. Our operating losses have historically been driven by start-up costs, costs of developing our technology, including new product and service offerings, and operating expenses related to increased headcount as a result of our overall growth and expansion into new markets. As we seek to grow our revenues and customer base, we plan to continue to invest in our business in order to capitalize on emerging opportunities and expand our EIS and demand response solutions, which will require increased operating expenses. Although we believe we will be able to grow our revenues at rates that will allow us to achieve profitability again in the future, these increased operating expenses, as well as other factors, will cause us to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nIf we fail to successfully educate existing and potential enterprise and utility customers, and electric power grid operators regarding the benefits of our EIS and demand response solutions or a market otherwise fails to develop for our EIS and demand response solutions, our ability to sell our EIS and demand response solutions and grow our business could be limited.\nOur future success depends on continued commercial acceptance of our EIS and demand response solutions. The market for our EIS and demand response solutions is relatively new. If we are unable to educate our potential customers about the advantages of our EIS and demand response solutions over competing products and services, or if our existing customers no longer rely on our EIS and demand response solutions, our ability to sell our EIS and demand response solutions will be limited. In addition, the energy intelligence software sector is rapidly evolving and therefore, we cannot accurately assess the size of the market and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. For example, we may have difficulty predicting customer needs and developing EIS and demand response solutions that address those needs. If the market for our EIS and demand response solutions does not continue to develop, our ability to grow our business could be limited and we may not be able to operate profitably.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to develop new EIS offerings, and enhance the functionality of our current EIS and demand response solutions.\nThe market for our EIS and demand response solutions is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new software introductions, internet-demand response technology enhancements, uncertain product life cycles, changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards and regulations. We may not be able to successfully develop and market new EIS offerings that comply with present or emerging industry regulations and technology standards. Also, any new or modified regulation or technology standard could increase our cost of doing business.\nAs part of our strategy to enhance our EIS and demand response solutions and grow our business, we plan to continue to make substantial investments in the research and development of new technologies. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to design and sell new, competitive EIS offerings and enhance our existing EIS and demand response solutions. Initiatives to develop new EIS and demand response solutions will require continued investment, and we may experience unforeseen problems in the performance of our technologies and operational processes, including new technologies and operational processes that we develop and deploy, to implement our EIS and demand response solutions. In addition, software supporting our EIS and demand response solutions is complex and can be expensive to develop, and new software and software enhancements can require long development and testing periods. If we are unable to develop new EIS offerings or enhancements to our existing EIS and demand response solutions on a timely basis, or if the market does not accept our new or enhanced EIS and demand response solutions, we will lose opportunities to realize revenues and obtain customers, and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets; if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and revenues.\nThe market for EIS and demand response solutions is fragmented. Some traditional providers of advanced metering infrastructure services have added, or may add, energy software and services to their existing business. We face strong competition from other energy management service providers, both larger and smaller than we are. We also compete against traditional supply-side resources such as natural gas-fired peaking power plants. In addition, utilities and competitive electricity suppliers offer their own energy software and services, which could decrease our base of potential customers and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Our competitors could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model or develop products or services that are more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. Some advanced metering infrastructure service providers, for example, are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the ability to combine advanced metering and demand response services into an integrated offering to a large, existing customer base. Our competitors may offer services and products at prices below cost or even for free in order to improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete, and reduce our market share and revenues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may also face competition based on technological developments that reduce peak demand for electricity, increase power supplies through existing infrastructure or that otherwise compete with our EIS and demand response solutions.\nAn increased rate of terminations by our enterprise customers, or their failure to renew contracts when they expire, would negatively impact our business by reducing our revenues and requiring us to spend more money to maintain and grow our enterprise customer base.\nThe loss of revenues resulting from enterprise customer contract terminations or expirations could be significant, and limiting enterprise customer terminations is an important factor in our ability to achieve growth and profitability in future periods. The failure to maintain our existing enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a combined company.\nEnterprise customer and utility customer sales cycles can be lengthy and unpredictable and require significant employee time and financial resources with no assurances that we will realize revenues.\nSales cycles with enterprise and utility customers are generally long and unpredictable. The enterprises and utilities that are our potential customers generally have extended budgeting, procurement and approval processes. They also tend to be risk averse and to follow industry trends rather than be the first to purchase new products or services, which can extend the lead time for or prevent acceptance of new products or services. Accordingly, our potential enterprise and utility customers may take longer to reach a decision to purchase our EIS and demand response solutions. This extended sales process requires the dedication of significant time by our personnel and our use of significant financial resources, with no certainty of success or recovery of our related expenses. It is not unusual for an enterprise or utility customer to go through the entire sales process and not accept any proposal or quote. Long and unpredictable sales cycles with enterprise and utility customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial majority of our revenues are and have been generated from open market program sales of demand response to PJM, and the modification or termination of this open market program or sales relationship, or the modification or termination of a sales relationship with any future significant utility customer or electric power grid operator could materially adversely affect our business.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenues generated from open market sales to PJM, an electric power grid operator, accounted for 40%, 52% and 45%, respectively, of our total revenues. The modification or termination of our sales relationship with PJM, or the modification or termination of any of PJM\u2019s open market programs in which we participate, including PJM\u2019s introduction of new demand response products, changes to the operational requirements, including measurement and verification, related to the provision of demand response, modifications to the cost, quantity and clearing mechanics related to our participation in capacity auctions or other limitations on our ability to effectively manage our portfolio of demand response capacity, could significantly reduce our future revenues and profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe expiration of our existing utility contracts without obtaining renewal or replacement utility contracts, or the termination of any of our existing utility contracts, could negatively impact our business by reducing our revenues and profit margins, thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into utility contracts with our utility customers in different geographic regions in the United States, as well as in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and are regularly in discussions to enter into new utility contracts. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or extend our existing utility contracts or enter into new utility contracts on favorable terms, if at all. If, upon expiration, we are unable to renew or extend our existing utility contracts and are unable to enter into new utility contracts, our future revenues and profit margins could be significantly reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur existing utility contracts generally contain termination provisions pursuant to which the utility customer can terminate the contract under certain circumstances, including in the event that we fail to comply with the terms or provisions contained therein. In addition, in the event that we breach any of our utility contracts, we may be liable to pay the utility customer an associated fee or penalty payment in connection with such breach. The termination of any of our existing utility contracts, or any fees or penalties payable by us in connection with a breach of our existing utility contracts, could negatively impact our\nbusiness by reducing our revenues and profit margins, thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to obtain favorable prices in the open market programs in which we currently participate or choose to participate in the future, specifically in the PJM market, our revenues, gross profits and profit margins will be negatively impacted.\nIn open market programs, electric power grid operators generally seek bids from companies such as ours to provide demand response capacity based on prices offered in competitive bidding. These prices may be subject to volatility due to certain market conditions or other events and as a result, the prices offered to us for this demand response capacity may be significantly lower than historical prices. To the extent we are subject to price reductions in certain of the markets in which we currently participate or choose to participate in the future, our revenues, gross profits and profit margins could be negatively impacted. In addition, we may alter our participation in both new markets and in markets in which we currently offer our demand response solutions, including by determining not to participate in open market bids to provide demand response capacity. We also may be subject to reduced capacity prices or be unable to participate in certain open market programs for a period of time to the extent that our bidding strategy fails to produce favorable results. In addition, adverse changes in the general economic and market conditions in the regions in which we provide demand response capacity may result in a reduced demand for electricity, resulting in lower prices for capacity, both demand-side and supply-side, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the electric power industry for revenues and as a result, our operating results have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant variability due to volatility in electric power industry spending and other factors affecting the electric utility industry, such as seasonality of peak demand and overall demand for electricity.\nWe derive revenues from the sale of our demand response solutions directly or indirectly, to the electric power industry. Sales of our demand response solutions to utility customers and electric power grid operators may be deferred, canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of many factors, including challenging economic conditions, mergers and acquisitions involving these entities, fluctuations in interest rates, increased electric utility capital spending on traditional supply-side resources, and changing regulations and program rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of demand response capacity in open market bidding programs are particularly susceptible to variability based on changes in spending patterns of electric power grid operators, and the associated fluctuating market prices for capacity. In addition, peak demand for electricity and other capacity constraints tend to be seasonal. Peak demand in the United States tends to be most extreme in warmer months, which may lead some demand response capacity markets to yield higher prices for demand response capacity or contract for the availability of a greater amount of demand response capacity during these warmer months. As a result, our demand response revenues may be seasonal and therefore, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nFurther, occasional events, such as significant volatility in natural gas prices or potential decreases in availability, can lead utilities and electric power grid operators to implement short-term calls for demand response capacity to respond to these events, but we cannot be sure that such calls will occur or that we will be in a position to generate revenues when they do occur. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant variability in our revenues on both an annual and a quarterly basis as a result of these and other factors, which could negatively impact our business and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our future sales.\nIf the actual amount of demand response capacity that we make available under our capacity commitments is less than required, our committed capacity could be reduced and we could be required to make refunds or pay penalty fees, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe provide demand response capacity to our utility customers and electric power grid operators either under utility contracts or under terms established in open market bidding programs where capacity is purchased. Under the utility contracts and open market bidding programs, utilities and electric power grid operators make periodic payments to us based on the amount of demand response capacity that we are obligated to make available to them during the contract or delivery period, or make periodic payments to us based on the amount of demand response capacity that we bid to make available to them during the relevant period. We refer to these payments as committed capacity payments. Committed capacity is negotiated and established by the utility contract or set in the open market bidding process and is subject to subsequent confirmation by measurement and verification tests or performance in a demand response event. In our open market bidding programs, we offer different amounts of committed capacity to our electric power grid operator and utility customers based on market rules on a periodic basis. We refer to measured and verified capacity as our demonstrated or proven capacity. Once demonstrated, the proven capacity amounts typically establish a baseline of capacity for each C&I end-user site in our portfolio, on which committed capacity payments are calculated going forward and until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test when we are called upon to make capacity available.\nUnder some of our utility contracts and in certain open market bidding programs, any difference between our demonstrated capacity and the committed capacity on which capacity payments were previously made will result in either a refund payment, which we also refer to as a performance penalty payment, from us to our electric power grid operator or utility customer, or an additional payment to us by such customer. Any refund payable by us would reduce our deferred revenues, but would not impact our previously recognized revenues. If there is a refund payment due to an electric power grid operator or utility customer, we generally make a corresponding adjustment in our payments to the C&I end-users who failed to make the appropriate level of capacity available, however we are sometimes unable to do so. In addition, some of our utility contracts with, and open market programs established by, our electric power grid operator and utility customers provide for penalty payments, which could be substantial, in certain circumstances in which we do not meet our capacity commitments, either in measurement and verification tests or in demand response events. Further, because measurement and verification test results for some utility contracts and in certain open market bidding programs establish capacity levels on which payments will be made until the next measurement and verification test or demand response event, the payments to be made to us under these utility contracts and open market bidding programs could be reduced until the level of capacity is established at the next measurement and verification test or demand response event. We could experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results in future periods due to any refund or penalty payments, capacity payment adjustments, replacement costs or other payments made to our electric power grid operator or utility customers, which could be substantial.\nAn increased rate of terminations by our C&I end-users, their failure to renew contracts when they expire or the failure of these C&I end-users to make the appropriate levels of capacity available when called upon could negatively impact our ability to achieve our committed capacity and cause us to make refund payments to, or incur penalties imposed by, our utility customers and electric power grid operators.\nOur ability to provide demand response capacity under our utility contracts and in open market bidding programs depends on the amount of our MW obligations, and our ability to manage C&I end-users who enter into contracts with us to reduce electricity consumption on demand. If we are unsuccessful in limiting our C&I end-user terminations or if our existing C&I end-users do not renew their contracts as they expire, we may be unable to acquire a sufficient amount of MW or we may incur significant costs to replace MW in the demand response programs in which we participate, which could cause our revenues to decrease and our cost of revenues to increase.\nIn addition, certain demand response programs in which we currently participate or choose to participate in the future may have rigorous requirements, making it difficult for our C&I end-users to perform when called upon by us. In the event that our C&I end-users are unable to perform or perform at levels below that which they agreed to perform, we may be unable to achieve our committed capacity levels and may be subject to refunds or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPricing pressure related to electric capacity made available to electric power grid operators and utilities, or in the percentage or fixed amount paid to C&I end-users for making capacity available, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDecreases in the price of demand response capacity could result in a loss of utility customers or electric power grid operators or a decrease in the growth of our business, or it may require us to lower our prices for capacity to remain competitive, which could result in reduced revenues and lower profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increases in the percentage or fixed amount paid to C&I end-users by our competitors for making capacity available could result in a loss of C&I end-users or a decrease in the growth of our business. It could also require us to increase the percentage or fixed amount we pay to our C&I end-users to remain competitive, which would result in increases in the cost of revenues and lower profit margins and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the software systems we use in providing our EIS and demand response solutions or the manual implementation of such systems produce inaccurate information or are incompatible with the systems used by our customers or C&I end-users, it could preclude us from providing our EIS and demand response solutions, which could lead to a loss of revenues and trigger penalty payments.\nOur software is complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when introduced or subsequently modified. Software defects or inaccurate data may cause incorrect recording, reporting or display of information preventing us from successfully providing our EIS and demand response solutions, which may result in lost revenues, customer and C&I end-user dissatisfaction, and our customers and C&I end-users may seek to hold us liable for any damages incurred. As a result, we could lose customers and C&I end-users, our reputation could be harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently serve a customer and C&I end-user base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware, software applications and operating systems. Building control, process control and metering systems frequently reside on non-standard operating systems. Our EIS and demand response solutions need to interface with these non-standard systems in order to gather\nand assess data and to implement changes in electricity consumption. Our business depends on the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate our technology with new and existing hardware and software systems, including metering, building control, process control, and distributed generation systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and support new standards, especially Internet-based standards and building control and metering system protocol languages; and\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate additional software modules under development with our existing technology and operational processes.\nIf we are unable to adequately address any of these factors, our results of operations and prospects for growth could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may face certain product liability or warranty claims if we disrupt our customers\u2019 networks or applications, or if our EIS and demand response solutions fail to meet customer expectations.\nFor some of our current and planned applications our software and hardware is integrated with our enterprise customers\u2019 networks and software applications. The integration of our software and hardware may entail the risk of product liability or warranty claims based on disruption or security breaches to these networks or applications. In addition, the failure of our software and hardware to perform to customer expectations could give rise to warranty claims against us. Any of these claims, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation or divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Although we carry general liability insurance, our current insurance coverage could be insufficient to protect us from any and all liability that may be imposed under these types of claims. A material product liability claim may seriously harm our results of operations.\nFailure of third parties to manufacture or install quality products or provide reliable services in a timely manner or at all could cause delays in the delivery of our EIS and demand response solutions, or could result in a failure to provide accurate data to our customers or C&I end-users, which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers or C&I end-users and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide quality, reliable, and secure EIS and demand response solutions in a timely manner, which in part requires the proper functioning of facilities and equipment owned, operated, installed or manufactured by third parties upon which we depend. For example, our reliance on third parties includes:\n\u2022\nutilizing components that we or third parties install or have installed at customer and C&I end-user sites;\n\u2022\nrelying on metering information provided by third parties to accurately and reliably provide data to our utility customers and electric power grid operators;\n\u2022\noutsourcing email notification and cellular and paging wireless communications that are used to notify our C&I end-users of their need to reduce electricity consumption at a particular time and to execute instructions to devices installed at C&I end-user sites that are programmed to automatically reduce consumption on receipt of such communications; and\n\u2022\noutsourcing certain installation and maintenance operations to third-party providers.\nAny delays, malfunctions, inefficiencies or interruptions in these products, services or operations could adversely affect the reliability or operation of our EIS and demand response solutions, which could cause us to experience difficulty monitoring or retaining current customers or C&I end-users, and attracting new customers or C&I end-users. Any errors in metering information provided to us by third parties, including utilities and electric power grid operators, could also adversely affect the accuracy of customer data. Such delays and errors could result in an overpayment or underpayment to us and our enterprise customers from our electric power grid operator and utility customers, which in some instances may cause us to violate certain market rules and require us to make refunds to our electric power grid operator and utility customers and pay associated penalties or fines. In addition, in such instances our brand, reputation and growth could be negatively impacted.\nUnfavorable regulatory decisions, changes to the market rules applicable to the demand response programs in which we currently participate or may participate in the future, and varying regulatory structures in certain regional electric power markets could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable regulatory decisions in markets where we currently operate or choose to operate in the future could significantly and negatively affect our business. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issued a final rule in the National Environmental Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines that included an exemption allowing emergency generators to participate in emergency demand response programs for up to 100 hours per year. That rule was challenged by parties opposing the 100 hour limit, among other things. In a decision issued on May 1, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or the Court, reversed those portions of the rule that contained the 100 hour limit, and remanded the rule back to the EPA for further action. On July 15, 2015, the EPA filed a motion for a stay of the Court\u2019s order to allow the EPA to consider whether to propose a new final rule, and the Court\nsubsequently granted a stay until May 1, 2016. There is no guarantee that the EPA will undertake a new rulemaking, and the provisions of a new rule, if any, are not known. The result may be a decrease to or elimination of the 100 hour per year exemption for participation by affected emergency generators in emergency demand response programs. If either a decrease or elimination of the 100 hour exemption is adopted, some of the demand response capacity reductions that we aggregate from C&I end-users willing to reduce consumption from the electric power grid by activating their own back-up generators during demand response events would not qualify as capacity without the addition of certain emissions reduction equipment. If this were to occur, we may have to find alternative sources of capacity to meet our capacity obligations to our utility customers and electric power grid operators, or reduce our obligation through capacity auctions and/or bilateral contracts. If we were unable to procure additional sources of capacity to meet these obligations or we are unable to reduce our obligation, we could be subject to substantial penalties, and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, program or market rules could also be modified to change the design of or pricing related to a particular demand response program, which may adversely affect our participation in that program or cause us to cease participation in that program altogether, or a demand response program in which we currently participate could be eliminated in its entirety and/or replaced with a new program that is more expensive for us to operate or requires substantial changes to the business to enable continued participation. Any elimination or change in the design of any demand response program, including the retroactive application of market rule changes, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to government regulation and may become subject to modified or new government regulation, which may negatively impact our ability to sell and market our EIS and demand response solutions.\nFederal, state, provincial, local or foreign governmental entities may seek to change existing regulations, impose additional regulations or change their interpretation of the applicability of existing regulations. Any modified or new government regulation applicable to our current or future EIS and demand response solutions, whether at the federal, state, provincial or local level, may negatively impact the installation, servicing and marketing of, and costs and prices related to, our EIS and demand response solutions. In addition, despite our efforts to manage compliance with any other regulations to which we are subject, we may be found to be in non-compliance with such regulations and therefore subject to sanctions, including penalties or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile the electric power markets in which we operate are regulated, most of our business is not directly subject to the regulatory framework applicable to the generation and transmission of electricity, with the exception of Celerity Energy Partners San Diego, LLC, or Celerity, which exports power to the electric power grid and is thus subject to direct regulation by FERC and its regulations related to the sale of wholesale power at market based rates. However, we may become directly subject to the regulation of FERC and state regulators for other parts of our business besides Celerity to the extent we are deemed to own, operate, or control generation used to make wholesale sales of power or provide ancillary services that involve a sale of electric energy or capacity for resale, or the export of power to the electric power grid, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may be subject to governmental or regulatory investigations or audits from time to time in connection with our participation in certain demand response programs. Any investigation by FERC or any other governmental or regulatory authorities could result in a material adjustment to our historical financial statements and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As part of any regulatory investigation or audit, FERC or any other governmental or regulatory entity may review our performance under our utility contracts and open market bidding programs, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If an investigation or audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, in addition to any negative publicity associated with any such penalties or sanctions, as well as incur legal and related costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain of our utility contracts are subject to approval by federal, state, provincial, local, or foreign regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained or be issued on a timely basis, if at all.\nWe face risks related to our expansion into international markets.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past, and we intend to continue to consider the expansion of our addressable market by pursuing opportunities to provide our EIS and demand response solutions in international markets. New international markets may require us to respond to new and unanticipated regulatory, marketing, sales and other challenges. These efforts may be time-consuming and costly, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in responding to these and other challenges we may face as we enter and attempt to expand in international markets. International operations also entail a variety of other risks, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with numerous legislative, regulatory or market requirements of foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and local laws prohibiting bribery and corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership of certain businesses;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws of foreign countries, international organizations, such as the European Commission, treaties, and other international laws;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe inability to continue to benefit from local subsidies due to change in control; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable labor regulations.\nInternational operations are also subject to general geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. One or more of these factors could adversely affect any of our international operations and result in lower revenue and/or greater operating expenses than we expect, and could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions successfully, which may inhibit our rate of growth, and acquisitions that we complete may expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past acquired, and we intend to continue to consider additional acquisitions of companies, technologies and products that we believe could accelerate our ability to compete in our core markets or allow us to enter new markets. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates, reach agreement on potential acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate personnel or assets that we acquire or for other reasons. Our acquisition efforts may involve certain risks, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected acquisition costs or liabilities that may cause us to fail to meet our previously stated financial guidance, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;\n\u2022\nproblems that may arise with our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, which may result in us not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, and may include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time, including a shift in focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration;\n\u2022\ninadequate management resources available for integration activity and oversight;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain and motivate key employees;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nfailure of customers to accept our EIS and demand response solutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nfailure to combine service offerings quickly and effectively;\n\u2022\nfailure to effectively enhance acquired technology, applications, services and products or develop new applications, services and products relating to the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating financial reporting systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the timely filing of required reports with the SEC; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (appropriate for a larger public company) at companies that, prior to their acquisition, lacked such controls, procedures and policies, which may result in ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving the expected synergies from an acquisition including taking longer than expected to achieve those synergies;\n\u2022\nincurring future impairment charges related to diminished fair value of businesses acquired as compared to the price we paid for them;\n\u2022\nrestructuring operations or reductions in workforce, which may result in substantial financial charges; and\n\u2022\nissuance of potentially dilutive equity securities and/or the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and may encounter events or circumstances that would require us to record an impairment charge relating to our goodwill and other intangible assets balances which would have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates. These estimates are based on, among other factors, input from accredited valuation consultants, reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations.\nIn future periods, we may be subject to factors that may constitute a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds fair value or our intangible assets may not be recoverable. These changes may consist of, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and slower growth rates in our industry. Any of these factors, or others, could require us to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. We generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by an asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate.\nIf the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to be impaired, we will write-down the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset to its implied fair value in the period identified. This impairment test could result in a material impairment charge that would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of various factors, including but not limited to our market capitalization as of our November 30, 2015 test date, we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill was higher than its implied fair value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $108.8 million. Following this impairment charge and as of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $94.1 million of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe expect to continue to expand our sales and marketing, operations, and research and development capabilities, as well as our financial and reporting systems, and as a result we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience continued growth in the number of our employees and significant growth in the scope of our operations. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, and financial and reporting systems, continue to improve our internal controls, procedures and compliance programs, expand our facilities, and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. All of these measures will require significant expenditures and will demand the attention of management. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, continue to implement sufficient internal controls, procedures or compliance programs, or recruit and adequately train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plan or disrupt our operations.\nWe allocate our operations, sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and financial resources based on our business plan, which includes assumptions about the demand for our EIS and demand response solutions, current and future utility contracts and open market programs with utility customers and electric power grid operators, current and future contracts with enterprise customers, variable prices in open market programs for demand response capacity, the development of ancillary services markets which enable demand response as a revenue generating resource and a variety of other factors relating to electricity markets. However, these factors are uncertain. If our assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect, actual demand for our EIS and demand response solutions could be significantly less than anticipated demand and we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth or achieve profitability in future periods.\nWe have begun to manage our operations in two reportable segments. The new operating structure has been in effect for a limited period of time, and there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully operate in distinct business units.\nEffective January 1, 2016, we began operating as two distinct business units, Software and Demand Response, each with dedicated sales, marketing, and operations functions. These changes are designed to enable us to pursue distinct strategies for each business unit and to better evaluate our performance executing on those strategies. There are substantial uncertainties associated with these efforts, including the investment of significant time and resources, the possibility that these efforts will be\nunprofitable, and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Factors such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of these efforts.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if our operating expenses and cost of sales do not correspond with the timing of our revenues.\nMost of our operating expenses, such as employee compensation and rental expense for properties, are either relatively fixed in the short-term or incurred in advance of sales. Moreover, our spending levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues. As a result, if revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter.\nIn certain forward capacity demand response markets in which we participate or may choose to participate in the future, it may take longer for us to begin earning revenues from MW we enable, in some cases up to a year after enablement. For example, the PJM limited demand response product operates on a June to May program-year basis, which means that a MW that we enable after June of each year will typically not be recognized until the following year. The up-front costs we incur to enable our MW in PJM and other similar markets, coupled with the delay in receiving revenues from those MW, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may require significant additional capital to pursue our growth strategy, but we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe growth of our business will depend on substantial amounts of additional capital for marketing and product development of our EIS and demand response solutions, and posting financial assurances in order to enter into utility contracts and open market bidding programs with utilities and electric power grid operators. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, our introduction of new EIS and demand response solutions, enhancements to our existing EIS and demand response solutions, and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities. In addition, we may consider strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies to grow our business, which could require significant capital and could increase our capital expenditures related to the future operation of acquired businesses or technologies. We may not be able to obtain loans or additional capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the $126.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2019, or the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to regulatory, economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to repay the principal amount of the Notes at maturity, to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and instruments governing our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nAt maturity in 2019, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and payable by us. Holders of the Notes will also have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes following our receipt of stockholder approval, if applicable, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments with respect to the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repay the principal amount of the Notes, make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or settle conversions of the Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repay the principal amount of the Notes, repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, including the $30.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, which we refer to as the 2014 credit facility. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe 2014 credit facility contains financial and operating restrictions that may limit our access to credit. If we fail to comply with covenants contained in the 2014 credit facility, we may be required to repay our indebtedness thereunder.\nProvisions in the 2014 credit facility impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ntransfer assets; make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on, or repurchase, EnerNOC stock;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate; or\n\u2022\nundergo a change of control.\nIn addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants customary with this type of credit facility, including maintaining minimum unrestricted cash and a minimum specified ratio of current assets to current liabilities. The 2014 credit facility also contains other customary covenants. We may not be able to comply with these covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default and could cause us to be unable to borrow under the 2014 credit facility. In addition to preventing additional borrowings under the 2014 credit facility, an event of default, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the 2014 credit facility, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. In addition, in the event that we default under the 2014 credit facility while we have letters of credit outstanding, we will be required to post up to 105% of the value of the letters of credit in cash with SVB to collateralize those letters of credit. Furthermore, the 2014 credit facility matures on August 9, 2016. If we fail to extend, renew or replace the 2014 credit facility when it matures, and we still have letters of credit issued and outstanding, we will be required to post up to 105% of the value of the letters of credit in cash with SVB to collateralize those letters of credit.\nWhile we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the 2014 credit facility as of December 31, 2015, if an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or collateralization of our letters of credit. In addition, we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, electric system reliability, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and requires companies to maintain appropriate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by agents or local partners or representatives. In addition, regulators may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies which we acquire. We are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act and may be subject to certain anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we do business. We are also subject to the export and re-export control laws of the U.S., including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, or EAR. We are also subject to U.S. government contracting laws, rules and regulations, and may be subject to government contracting laws of other countries in which we do business. If we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the FCPA, EAR or U.S. government contracting laws, or the anti-corruption, export or governmental contracting laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the U.S. or other countries could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nIf we lose key personnel upon whom we are dependent, or if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives.\nOur continued success depends upon the continued availability, contributions, vision, skills, experience and effort of our senior management, sales and marketing, research and development, and operations teams. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees. We have entered into employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team, but none of these agreements guarantee the services of the individual for a specified period of time. All of the employment arrangements with our key personnel, including the members of our senior management team, provide that employment is at-will and may be terminated by the employee at any time and without notice. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel might impede our operations or the achievement of our strategic and financial objectives. We rely on our research and development team to research, design and develop new and enhanced EIS and demand response solutions. We rely on our operations team to install, test, deliver and manage our EIS and demand response solutions. We rely on our sales and marketing team to sell our EIS and demand response solutions to our customers, build our brand and promote our company.\nThe loss or interruption of the service of members of our senior management, sales and marketing, research and development, or operations teams, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel or advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could significantly reduce our ability to manage our operations and implement our strategy.\nAn inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon the maintenance and protection of the intellectual property related to our EIS and demand response solutions. We hold 17 patents and numerous trademarks and copyrights; in addition we have filed 60 patent applications. Patent protection is unavailable for certain aspects of the technology and operational processes that are important to our business. Any patent held by us or to be issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, could be challenged, invalidated, unenforceable or circumvented. Patent protection is unavailable for certain aspects of the technology and operational processes that are important to our business. To date, we have relied principally on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and proprietary information agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, we have not obtained confidentiality and proprietary information agreements from all of our customers and vendors, and although we have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with all of our employees, we cannot be certain that these agreements will be honored. Some of our confidentiality and proprietary information agreements may not be in writing, and some customers are subject to laws and regulations that require them to disclose information that we would otherwise seek to keep confidential. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive, as is enforcing our rights against unauthorized use. The steps that we have taken or may take may not prevent misappropriation of the intellectual property on which we rely. In addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in jurisdictions outside the United States, as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. From time to time, third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. Any litigation could be unsuccessful, cause us to incur substantial costs, divert resources away from our daily operations and result in the impairment of our intellectual property. Failure to adequately enforce our rights could cause us to lose rights in our intellectual property and may negatively affect our business.\nWe may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation related to allegations that our EIS and demand response solutions infringe on intellectual property held by others, which could result in the loss of use of those applications, services and products.\nThird-party patent applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may relate to our EIS and demand response solutions. As a result, third-parties may in the future make infringement and other allegations that could subject us to intellectual property litigation relating to our EIS and demand response solutions, which could be time-consuming and expensive, divert attention and resources away from our daily operations, impede or prevent delivery of our EIS and demand response solutions and require us to pay significant royalties, licensing fees and damages. In addition, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our EIS and demand response solutions and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe use of open source software in our systems and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nOur information technology and other systems include software that is subject to open source licenses. While we monitor the use of all open source software in our EIS and demand response solutions and take certain measures to ensure that no open source software is used or distributed in such a way as to subject our EIS and demand response solutions to any unanticipated conditions or restrictions, such use or distribution could inadvertently occur. In the event that any of our EIS and demand response solutions were determined to be subject to an open source license, whether through our own incorporation of software or through licensed software from a third-party provider, we could be required to release the affected portions of our source code publicly, make portions of such applications available under open source licenses, re-engineer all, or a portion of, such applications or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our EIS and demand response solutions, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our EIS and demand response solutions. Many of the risks associated with the usage of open source software are outside of our control and cannot be eliminated, and could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our information technology systems fail to adequately gather, assess and protect data used in providing our EIS and demand response solutions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively control the devices that gather and assess data used in providing our EIS and demand\nresponse solutions, manage relationships with our customers and C&I end-users, and maintain our research and development data. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and product development and make us unable, or severely limit our ability, to provide our EIS and demand response solutions. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nearthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers;\n\u2022\npower loss; and\n\u2022\ncomputer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data network failure.\nAny interruption in the operation of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenues under our contracts and commitments, reduced profit margins on revenues where fixed payments are due to our C&I end-users, reductions in our demonstrated capacity levels going forward, customer dissatisfaction and lawsuits, and could subject us to penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny internal or external security breaches involving our EIS and demand response solutions and even the perception of security risks involving our EIS and demand response solutions or the transmission of data over the Internet, whether or not valid, could harm our reputation and inhibit market acceptance of our EIS and demand response solutions and cause us to lose customers.\nWe use our EIS and demand response solutions to compile and analyze sensitive or confidential information related to our customers and C&I end-users. In addition, some of our EIS and demand response solutions allow us to remotely control equipment at our C&I end-user sites. Our EIS and demand response solutions rely on the secure transmission of proprietary data over the Internet for some of this functionality. Well-publicized compromises of Internet security, or cyber-attacks, could have the effect of substantially reducing confidence in the Internet as a medium of data transmission. The occurrence or perception of security breaches in our EIS and demand response solutions, or our customers\u2019 or C&I end-users\u2019 concerns about Internet security or the security of our EIS and demand response solutions whether or not they are warranted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, harm our reputation, inhibit market acceptance of our EIS and demand response solutions and cause us to lose customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if in handling sensitive or confidential information we fail to comply with privacy or security laws, we could incur civil liability to government agencies, customers, C&I end-users and/or individuals whose privacy is compromised. In addition, third parties may attempt to breach our security or inappropriately use our EIS and demand response solutions, particularly as we grow our business, through computer viruses, electronic break-ins and other disruptions. We may also face a security breach or electronic break-in by one of our employees or former employees. If a breach is successful, confidential information may be improperly obtained, and we may be subject to lawsuits and other liabilities.\nOur ability to provide security deposits or letters of credit is limited and could negatively affect our ability to bid on or enter into utility contracts or arrangements with utilities and electric power grid operators.\nWe are increasingly required to provide security deposits in the form of cash to secure our performance under utility contracts or open market bidding programs with our utility customers and electric power grid operators for the provision of our demand response solutions. In addition, some of our utility customers and electric power grid operators require collateral in the form of letters of credit to secure our performance or to fund possible damages or penalty payments resulting from our failure to make available capacity at agreed upon levels or any other event of default by us. Our ability to obtain such letters of credit primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation and external factors beyond our control, including the overall capacity of the credit market. Events that affect credit markets generally may result in letters of credit becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. As of December 31, 2015, we had $22.4 million in outstanding letters of credit under the 2014 credit facility, leaving $7.6 million available under this facility for additional letters of credit.\nWe may be required, from time to time, to seek alternative sources of security deposits or letters of credit, which may be expensive and difficult to obtain, if available at all. Our inability to obtain letters of credit and, as a result, to bid or enter into utility contracts or arrangements with electric power grid operators or utilities, could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects. In addition, in the event that we default under our utility contracts or open market bidding programs with our electric power grid operator and utility customers pursuant to which we have posted collateral, we may lose a portion of, or all such collateral, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for United States federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change. We may experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, as we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liabilities. Although, in the past, we have been able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset the maximum amount of taxable income allowed by the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, we may not be able to utilize some or all of these net operating losses in the future.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to audit by various federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding income tax and non-income tax matters. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, withholding obligations and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Although we believe our approach to determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, a final determination of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nFluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in which we conduct our business, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could harm our business and prospects.\nWe have various operations outside the United States. The expenses of our international operations are denominated in local currencies. In addition, our foreign sales may be denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, cost of revenues and profit margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency or maintain receivable balances, including those from our international subsidiaries. In the last few years we have not hedged foreign currency exposures, but we may in the future hedge foreign currency denominated sales. There is a risk that any hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange exposure and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to potential risks and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if, when aggregated, they constituted a material weakness. As a result of this evaluation, no material weaknesses were identified.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs, including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels, in order to maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We continue to monitor controls for any weaknesses or deficiencies. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, as we continue to expand globally, the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls will increase and will require that we continue to improve our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn the future, if we fail to complete the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 evaluation in a timely manner, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot opine in a timely manner to our internal control over financial reporting, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, which also may result in a loss of public confidence in our internal controls and adversely impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, any failure to implement required, new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate. If we fail in future periods to meet our publicly announced financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may be misleading. The results of one quarter should not be used as an indication of future performance. We provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance. Our revenues and operating results may fail to meet our previously stated financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Our failure to meet such expectations or our financial guidance could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results may vary depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemand for and acceptance of our EIS and demand response solutions;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our demand response business in certain of the markets in which we operate, where revenues recognized under certain utility contracts and pursuant to certain open market bidding programs can be concentrated in particular seasons and months;\n\u2022\nchanges in open market bidding program rules and reductions in pricing for demand response capacity;\n\u2022\ndelays in the implementation and delivery of our EIS and demand response solutions which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenues;\n\u2022\ndelays or reductions in spending for EIS and demand response solutions by our electric power grid operator or utility customers and potential enterprise customers;\n\u2022\nthe long lead time associated with securing new customer contracts;\n\u2022\nthe structure of any forward capacity market in which we participate, which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenues related to that market;\n\u2022\nthe mix of our revenues during any period, particularly on a regional basis, since local fees recognized as revenues for demand response capacity tend to vary according to the level of available capacity in given regions;\n\u2022\nthe termination or expiration of existing contracts with electric power grid operators, utility customers, enterprise customers and/or C&I end-users;\n\u2022\npotential interruptions of our customers\u2019 or C&I end-users' operations;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new relationships and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers and strategic partners;\n\u2022\ntemporary capacity programs that could be implemented by electric power grid operators and utilities to address short-term capacity deficiencies;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of penalties or the reversal of deferred revenue due to our failure to meet a capacity commitment;\n\u2022\nthe elimination, modification or flawed design of, or our decision not to participate or to reduce our participation in, any demand response program in which we currently participate;\n\u2022\nglobal economic and credit market conditions; and\n\u2022\nincreased expenditures for sales and marketing, software development and other corporate activities.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nFor the period of January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $19.04 on February 26, 2015 and a low of $3.76 on December 21, 2015. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016 our stock price has traded as low as $2.92.\nOur stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemand for and acceptance of our EIS and demand response solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new relationships and maintain and enhance existing relationships with customers and strategic partners;\n\u2022\ntermination of or rule changes in open market bidding programs and/or reductions in pricing for demand response capacity;\n\u2022\nthe termination or expiration of existing contracts with enterprise and utility customers;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and overall fluctuations in equity markets in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe elimination, modification or flawed design of, or our decision not to participate or to reduce our participation in, any demand response program in which we currently participate;\n\u2022\nintroduction of technological innovations or new EIS and demand response solutions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly revenues and operating results;\n\u2022\nthe financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or our failure to meet such guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ndelays in the implementation and delivery of our EIS and demand response solutions which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenues;\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulations affecting our industry in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nthe way in which we recognize revenues and the timing associated with our recognition of revenues;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to recent acquisitions, including with respect to expected synergies, and any unforeseen integration costs or impairment charges;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\npotential interruptions of our customers\u2019 operations;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our demand response business in certain of the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nfailure to secure adequate capital to fund our operations, or the future sale or issuance of equity securities at prices below fair market price;\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors including disasters or crises; and\n\u2022\nany announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Our stock price has been particularly volatile recently and may continue to be volatile in the near term and we could incur substantial costs defending any lawsuit brought against us by any of our stockholders. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law, and of some of our employment arrangements, may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult and could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which we may have otherwise received a premium to the market value of our common stock. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, providing that not all members of the board be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings, which were modified in February 2014;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of 75% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nSome of our employment arrangements and equity agreements provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of equity awards, upon a change of control. These provisions may discourage or prevent a change of control. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nThe foregoing provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Except for opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt and/or equity securities, we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the development, operation and growth of our business. In addition, the 2014 credit facility prohibits us from paying dividends and future loan agreements may also prohibit the payment of dividends. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, business opportunities, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant. To the extent we do not pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If these analysts do not continue to provide adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, require significant resources, increase our costs and distract our management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with equity securities listed on NASDAQ, we must comply with statutes and regulations of the SEC and the requirements of NASDAQ. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of the time of our board of directors and management and significantly increases our costs and expenses. In addition, as a public company we incur substantial costs to obtain director and officer liability insurance policies. These factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee.", "PERMNO": 92038, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ENOC"}
