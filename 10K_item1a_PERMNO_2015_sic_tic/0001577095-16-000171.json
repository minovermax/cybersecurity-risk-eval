RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe may not be able to attract and retain club members, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain members at our clubs and maintain or increase usage of our facilities. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, particularly those affecting the popularity of golf and private dining, and other social and demographic trends could adversely affect our business. Historically, we have experienced varying levels of membership enrollment and attrition rates and, in certain areas, decreased levels of usage of our facilities. Significant periods where attrition rates exceed enrollment rates or where facilities usage is below historical levels would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For fiscal year 2015, 47.0% of our total revenues came from recurring membership dues. For the same period, 23.1% of our business, sports and alumni club memberships (approximately 14,300 memberships) and 17.0% of our golf and country club memberships (approximately 19,600 memberships) were resigned. After the addition of new memberships, on a same store basis, our business, sports and alumni clubs experienced a (1.2)% net loss in memberships, excluding managed clubs and a (1.2)% net loss in memberships for managed clubs. Our golf and country clubs, also on a same store basis, experienced a 0.4% net gain in memberships, excluding managed clubs and a 3.3% net gain in memberships for managed clubs. If we cannot attract new members or retain our existing members, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nChanges in consumer spending patterns, particularly discretionary expenditures for leisure, recreation and travel, are susceptible to factors beyond our control that may reduce demand for our products and services.\nConsumer spending patterns, particularly discretionary expenditures for leisure, recreation and travel, are particularly susceptible to factors beyond our control that may reduce demand for our products and services, including demand for memberships, golf, vacation and business travel and food and beverage sales. These factors include:\n\u2022\nlow consumer confidence;\n\u2022\ndepressed housing prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in the desirability of particular locations, residential neighborhoods, office space or travel patterns of members;\n\u2022\ndecreased corporate budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business (e.g., industry conventions);\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires and floods;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries and its impact on travel; and\n\u2022\nvolatility in energy prices and the impact on consumers employed within energy-related industries.\nThese factors and other global, national and regional conditions can adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, individual properties, particular regions or our business as a whole. For example, during the recession, many businesses dramatically decreased the number of corporate events and meetings hosted at facilities such as convention centers, hotels, business clubs, golf clubs, resorts and retreats in an effort to cut costs and in response to public opinion relating to excess corporate spending, which negatively impacted the amount of business for such facilities, including certain of our facilities. Any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce demand or the rates our clubs are able to charge for memberships or services, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nEconomic recessions or downturns could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary or leisure spending by our members and guests and such spending can be particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The recession led to slower economic activity, increased unemployment, concerns about inflation and energy costs, decreased business and consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and lower levels of liquidity in many financial markets, which negatively affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, for fiscal years 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we experienced annualized attrition (i.e., members who resign) in membership count of 17.0%, 16.3%, 16.3%, 16.4% and 15.9%, respectively, in our golf and country clubs (excluding the impact of Sequoia Golf memberships in fiscal year 2014) and 23.1%, 22.7%, 22.8%, 22.9% and 23.5%, respectively, in our business, sports and alumni clubs. A renewed economic downturn in the United States, or in geographic areas in which we have strategic concentrations of clubs, may lead to increases in unemployment and loss of consumer confidence which may translate into resignations of existing members, a decrease in the rate of new memberships and reduced spending by our members. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by a renewed economic downturn.\nOur businesses will remain susceptible to future economic recessions or downturns, and any significant adverse shift in general economic conditions, whether local, regional, national or global, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During such periods of adverse economic conditions, we may be unable to increase membership dues or the price of our products and services and may experience increased rates of resignations of existing members, a decrease in the rate of new member enrollment or reduced spending by our members, any of which may result in, among other things, decreased revenues and financial losses. In addition, during periods of adverse economic conditions, we may have difficulty accessing financial markets or face increased funding costs, which could make it more difficult or impossible for us to obtain funding for additional investments and harm our results of operations.\nUnusual weather patterns and extreme weather events, as well as periodic and quasi-periodic weather patterns, such as those commonly associated with the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a-Southern Oscillation, could adversely affect the value of our golf courses or negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur operations and results are susceptible to non-seasonal and severe weather patterns. Extreme weather events or patterns in a given region, such as heavy rains, prolonged snow accumulations, extended heat waves and high winds, could reduce our revenues for that region by interrupting activities at affected properties which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. One factor that specifically affects our real estate investments in golf courses is the availability of\nwater. Turf grass conditions must be satisfactory to attract play on our golf courses, which requires significant amounts of water. Our ability to irrigate a golf course could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage, such as the recent drought affecting the southern and western United States and associated government imposed water restrictions. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in regard to a large number of properties could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We also have a high concentration of golf clubs in Texas, Georgia and California, which can experience periods of unusually hot, cold, dry or rainy weather due to a variety of periodic and quasi-periodic global climate phenomena, such as the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a-Southern Oscillation. For example, during fiscal year 2015, certain regions of Texas experienced periods of significant rain fall, which we believe resulted in lower revenue growth at our same store Texas clubs. Texas same store clubs experienced revenue growth of 2.0% in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014, while our non-Texas same store clubs experienced revenue growth of 2.7% for the same period. If these phenomena and their impacts on weather patterns persist for extended periods of time, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe could be required to make material cash outlays in future periods if the number of initiation deposit refund requests we receive materially increases or if we are required to surrender unclaimed initiation deposits to state authorities under applicable escheatment laws.\nAt a majority of our private clubs, members are expected to pay an initiation fee or deposit upon their acceptance as a member to the club. Initiation fees, which are more typical for our business clubs and mid-market golf and country clubs, are\ngenerally nonrefundable. In contrast to initiation fees, initiation deposits, which are typical in our more prestigious golf and country clubs, paid by members upon joining one of our clubs are fully refundable after a fixed number of years, typically 30 years, and upon the occurrence of other contract-specific conditions. Historically, only a small percentage of initiation deposits eligible to be refunded have been requested by members. As of December 29, 2015, the amount of initiation deposits that are eligible to be refunded currently within the next 12 months is $153.0 million on a gross basis. When refunds are made, we must fund the payment of such amounts from our available cash. If the number of refunds dramatically increases in the future, our financial condition could suffer and the funding requirement for such refunds could strain our cash on hand or otherwise force us to reduce or delay capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate planned dividend payments, sell assets or operations or seek additional capital in order to raise the cash necessary to make such refunds. As of December 29, 2015, the discounted value of initiation deposits that may be refunded in future years (not including the next 12 months) is $204.3 million. For more information on our initiation deposit amounts, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nWhile we will make a refund to any member whose initiation deposit is eligible to be refunded, we may be subject to various states\u2019 escheatment laws with respect to initiation deposits that have not been refunded to members. All states have escheatment laws and generally require companies to remit to the state cash in an amount equal to unclaimed and abandoned property after a specified period of dormancy, which is typically 3 to 5 years. We currently do not remit to states any amounts relating to initiation deposits that are eligible to be refunded to members based upon our interpretation of the applicability of such laws to initiation deposits. The analysis of the potential application of escheatment laws to our initiation deposits is complex, involving an analysis of constitutional and statutory provisions and contractual and factual issues. While we do not believe that initiation deposits must be escheated, we may be forced to remit such amounts if we are challenged and fail to prevail in our position.\nIn addition, most of the states in which we conduct business have hired third-party auditors to conduct unclaimed and abandoned property audits of our operations. Certain categories of property, such as uncashed payroll checks or uncashed vendor payments, are escheatable in the ordinary course of business and we have entered into closing agreements with the majority of the states regarding the escheatment of cash amounts for such categories and have remitted these amounts to the respective states; however, the audits have not been terminated. We have been in ongoing communication with several states represented by such auditors, who are demanding additional and detailed information and records related to initiation deposits. We expect to vigorously defend ourselves in any legal proceedings under applicable state laws seeking to have us remit initiation deposits eligible to be refunded to any of our members that have not been previously refunded to such members during the applicable state\u2019s dormancy period. However, if we are ultimately unsuccessful in arguing our right to continue holding such amounts, we may be forced to pay such amounts to the claiming states. While we believe we have strong arguments against claims for the escheatment of unclaimed initiation deposits made under state escheatment laws, if a material portion of the initiation deposits otherwise eligible to be refunded were awarded or remitted to any state(s), our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and we may be required to reduce or delay capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate planned dividend payments, sell assets or operations or seek additional capital in order to raise the corresponding cash required to satisfy such amounts. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet such obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements.\nOur ability to attract and retain members depends heavily on successfully locating our clubs in suitable locations, and any impairment of a club location, including any decrease in member or customer traffic, could impact our results of operations.\nOur approach to identifying clubs in suitable locations typically favors locations where our facilities are or can become a part of the community. As a result, our clubs are typically located near urban and residential centers that we believe are consistent with our members\u2019 lifestyle choices. Memberships and sales at these locations are derived, in part, from proximity to key local landmarks, business centers, facilities and residential areas. We may be forced to close clubs or club locations may become unsuitable due to, and such clubs\u2019 results of operations may be harmed by, among other things:\n\u2022\neconomic downturns in a particular area;\n\u2022\ncompetition from nearby recreational or entertainment venues;\n\u2022\nchanging demographics in a particular market or area;\n\u2022\nchanging lifestyle choices of consumers in a particular market; and\n\u2022\nthe closing or declining popularity of other businesses and entertainment venues located near our clubs.\nChanges in areas around our club locations could render such locations unsuitable and cause memberships at such clubs to decline, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe have significant operations concentrated in certain geographic areas, and any disruption in the operations of our clubs in any of these areas could harm our results of operations.\nAs of December 29, 2015, we operated multiple clubs in several metropolitan areas, including 33 in the greater Atlanta, Georgia region, 19 near Houston, Texas, 17 in and around Dallas, Texas and 9 in the greater Los Angeles, California region. As a result, any prolonged disruption in the operations of our clubs in any of these markets, whether due to technical difficulties, power failures or destruction or damage to the clubs as a result of a natural disaster, fire or any other reason, could harm our results of operations or may result in club closures. In addition, some of the metropolitan areas where we operate clubs could be disproportionately affected by regional economic conditions, such as declining home prices and rising unemployment. Concentration in these markets increases our exposure to adverse developments related to competition, as well as economic and demographic changes in these areas.\nSeasonality may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur quarterly results fluctuate as a result of a number of factors. Usage of our golf and country club facilities declines significantly during the first and fourth quarters, when colder temperatures and shorter days reduce the demand for outdoor activities. Our business clubs typically generate a greater share of their annual revenues in the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday and year-end party season. In addition, the first, second and third fiscal quarters each consist of twelve weeks, whereas the fourth quarter consists of sixteen or seventeen weeks. As a result of these factors, we usually generate a disproportionate share of our revenues and cash flows in the second, third and fourth quarters of each year and have lower revenues and cash flows in the first quarter. This seasonality means our business and results of operations are disproportionately vulnerable to the occurrence of other risks during the periods of increased member usage due to the larger percentage of revenues we generate during such times.\nCompetition in the industry in which we compete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and compete primarily on the basis of reputation, featured facilities, location, quality and breadth of member product offerings and price. As a result, competition for market share in the industry in which we compete is significant. In order to succeed, we must take market share from local and regional competitors and sustain our membership base in the face of increasing recreational alternatives available to our existing and prospective members. Our business clubs compete on a local and regional level with restaurants and other business and social clubs. The number and variety of competitors in this business varies based on the location and setting of each facility, with some situated in intensely competitive upscale urban areas characterized by frequent innovations in the products and services offered by competing restaurants and other business, dining and social clubs. In addition, in most regions, these businesses are in constant flux as new restaurants and other social and meeting venues open or expand their amenities. As a result of these characteristics, the supply in a given region often exceeds the demand for such facilities, and any increase in the number or quality of restaurants and other social and meeting venues, or the products and services they provide, in a given region could significantly impact the ability of our clubs to attract and retain members, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur golf and country club facilities compete on a local and regional level with other country clubs and golf facilities. The level of competition in the golf and country club business varies from region to region and is subject to change as existing facilities are renovated or new facilities are developed. An increase in the number or quality of similar clubs and other facilities in a particular region could significantly increase competition, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations also could be affected by a number of additional competitive factors, including the availability of, and demand for, alternative venues for recreational pursuits, such as multi-use sports and athletic centers. In addition, member-owned and individual privately-owned clubs may be able to create a perception of exclusivity that we have difficulty replicating given the diversity of our portfolio and the scope of our holdings. To the extent these alternatives succeed in diverting actual or prospective members away from our facilities or affect our membership rates, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and key employees.\nThe loss of the services of our senior management could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to retain existing management and key employees, including club\nmanagers, membership sales and support personnel, which could result in harm to our member and employee relationships, loss of expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. In addition, we have not obtained key man life insurance policies for any of our senior management team. As a result, it may be difficult to cover the financial loss if we were to lose the services of any members of our senior management team. The loss of members of our senior management team or key employees could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur large workforce subjects us to risks associated with increases in the cost of labor as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates and required wage increases and health benefit coverage, lawsuits or labor union activity.\nLabor is our primary property-level operating expense. As of December 29, 2015, we employed approximately 18,300 hourly-wage and salaried employees at our clubs and corporate offices. For fiscal year 2015, labor-related expense accounted for 47.3% of our total club operating costs and expenses. We may face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or increases in the federal or state minimum wage or other employee benefit costs. For example, if the federal minimum wage were increased significantly, we would have to assess the financial impact on our operations as we have a large population of hourly employees. If labor-related expenses increase, our operating expense could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation and other working conditions, citizenship requirements, discrimination and family and medical leave. In recent years, a number of companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, overtime wage policies, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits may be threatened or instituted against us from time to time, and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. While these efforts have achieved only limited success to date, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future. In addition, future legislation could amend the National Labor Relations Act to make it easier for unions to organize and obtain collectively bargained benefits, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in our cost of goods, rent, water, utilities and taxes could reduce our operating margins and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors may not be directly offset by increased revenue. Our most significant operating costs, other than labor, are our cost of goods, water, utilities, rent and property taxes. Many, and in some cases all, of the factors affecting these costs are beyond our control. Our cost of goods such as food and beverage costs account for a significant portion of our total property-level operating expense. Cost of goods represented 14.5% of our total club operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2015. While we have not experienced material increases in the cost of goods, if our cost of goods increased significantly and we are not able to pass along those increased costs to our members in the form of higher prices or otherwise, our operating margins would suffer, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, rent accounts for a significant portion of our property-level operating expense. Rent expense represented 3.7% of our total club operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2015. Significant increases in our rent costs would increase our operating expense and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Utility costs, including water, represented 4.8% of our total club operating costs and expenses for fiscal year 2015. The prices of utilities are volatile, and shortages sometimes occur. In particular, municipalities are increasingly placing restrictions on the use of water for golf course irrigation and increasing the cost of water. Significant increases in the cost of our utilities, or any shortages, could interrupt or curtail our operations and lower our operating margins, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach of our properties is subject to real and personal property taxes. During fiscal year 2015, we paid approximately $18.1 million in property taxes. The real and personal property taxes on our properties may increase or decrease as tax rates change and as our clubs are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. If real and personal property taxes increase, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe have concentrated our investments in golf-related and business real estate and facilities, which are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that the values of our investments may decline if there is a prolonged downturn in real estate values.\nOur operations consist almost entirely of golf-related and business club facilities that encompass a large amount of real estate holdings. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with holding real estate investments. A prolonged decline in the popularity of golf-related or business club services, such as private dining, could adversely affect the value of our real estate holdings and could make it difficult to sell facilities or businesses.\nOur real estate holdings (including our long-term leaseholds) are subject to risks typically associated with investments in real estate. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned, expenses incurred and capital appreciation generated by the related properties. In addition, a variety of other factors affect income from properties and real estate values, including governmental regulations, real estate, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. For example, new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and time-consuming to expand, modify or renovate older properties. Under eminent domain laws, governments can take real property. Sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth. Any of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe illiquidity of real estate may make it difficult for us to dispose of one or more of our properties or negatively affect our ability to profitably sell such properties.\nWe may from time to time decide to dispose of one or more of our real estate assets. Because real estate holdings generally, and clubs like ours in particular, are relatively illiquid, we may not be able to dispose of one or more real estate assets on a timely basis. In some circumstances, sales may result in investment losses which could adversely affect our financial condition. The illiquidity of our real estate assets could mean that we continue to operate a facility that management has identified for disposition. Failure to dispose of a real estate asset in a timely fashion, or at all, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTiming, budgeting and other risks could delay our efforts to develop, redevelop or renovate the properties that we own, or make these activities more expensive, which could reduce our profits or impair our ability to compete effectively.\nWe must regularly expend capital to construct, maintain and renovate the properties that we own in order to remain competitive, pursue our business strategies, maintain and build the value and brand standards of our properties and comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we must periodically upgrade or replace the furniture, fixtures and equipment necessary to operate our business. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nconstruction delays or cost overruns (including labor and materials) that may increase project costs;\n\u2022\nobtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;\n\u2022\ngovernmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;\n\u2022\nforce majeure events, including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes or floods;\n\u2022\ndesign defects that could increase costs; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental concerns which may create delays or increase costs.\nThese projects create an ongoing need for cash, which if not generated by operations or otherwise obtained is subject to the availability of credit in the capital markets. Our ability to spend the money necessary to maintain the quality of our properties is significantly impacted by the cost and availability of capital, over which we have little control. The timing of capital improvements can affect property performance, including membership sales, retention and usage, particularly if we need to close golf courses or a significant number of other facilities, such as ballrooms, meeting spaces or dining areas. Moreover, the investments that we make may fail to improve the performance of the properties in the manner that we expect. If we are not able to begin operating properties as scheduled, or if investments harm or fail to improve our performance, our ability to compete effectively would be diminished and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties, or through alliances, which could disrupt our ongoing business, divert our management and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe continually evaluate opportunities to expand our business through strategic and complementary acquisitions of attractive properties. In many cases, we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Acquisitions or investments in businesses, properties or assets as well as alliances with third parties are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nspending cash, incurring debt, or issuing equity;\n\u2022\nassuming contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\ncreating additional expenses; or\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all, or that the ability to obtain financing will not be restricted by the terms of the secured credit facilities entered into by our subsidiary ClubCorp Club Operations, Inc. (\u201cOperations\u201d) on November 30, 2010, as amended (the \u201cSecured Credit Facilities\u201d), the indenture that governs the senior notes entered into on December 15, 2015 and maturing on December 15, 2023 (the \u201c2015 Senior Notes\u201d) or other indebtedness we may incur.\nThe success of any such acquisitions or investments will also depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations. We may experience difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, properties or other assets into our operations as planned, including difficulties relating to:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to integration challenges;\n\u2022\ngeographic diversity;\n\u2022\nintegrating information technology and other systems and personnel;\n\u2022\nretaining members; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated liabilities or litigation.\nOur inability to address these difficulties or other risks encountered in connection with any acquisitions and investments, including our acquisition of Sequoia Golf, could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such acquisitions or investments, and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties in our joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, which may limit our ability to manage risk.\nAs of December 29, 2015, we owned or operated eight properties or businesses in partnership with other entities, including joint ventures relating to six of our golf facilities, one of our business clubs and certain realty interests which we define as \u2018\u2018Non-Core Development Entities.\u2019\u2019 We may in the future enter into further joint ventures or other collaborative arrangements related to additional properties. Our investments in these joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not otherwise present in our business, including the risk that our partner may become bankrupt, the risk that we may\nnot be able to sell or dispose of our interest as a result of buy/sell rights that may be imposed by the joint venture agreement, the risk that our partner may have economic or other interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests and goals and the risk that our partner may be able to veto actions which may be in our best interests. Consequently, actions by a partner might subject clubs owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Additionally, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our partners, or our partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. Any of the foregoing could have a negative impact on the joint venture or its results of operations, and subsequently on our business or results of operations.\nOur insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to businesses in our industry. We carry commercial liability, fire, flood, earthquake, catastrophic wind and extended insurance coverage, as applicable, from solvent insurance carriers on all of our properties. We believe that the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate for foreseeable losses with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary for similar properties and that all of our existing golf and business clubs are insured within industry standards. Nevertheless, market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we can obtain in the future or restrict our ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any deductible and/or self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.\nIn the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations or the replacement cost of any lost investment. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Additionally, we could remain obligated for performance guarantees in favor of third-party property owners or for their debt or other financial obligations and we may not\nhave sufficient insurance to cover awards of damages resulting from our liabilities. If the insurance that we carry does not sufficiently cover damages or other losses, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn addition, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. For example, we maintain business interruption insurance, but there can be no assurance that the coverage for a severe or prolonged business interruption at one or more of our clubs would be adequate. Moreover, we believe that insurance covering liability for violations of wage and hour laws is generally not available. These losses, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccidents or injuries in our clubs or in connection with our operations may subject us to liability, and accidents or injuries could negatively impact our reputation and attendance, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are inherent risks of accidents or injuries at our properties or in connection with our operations, including injuries from premises liabilities such as slips, trips and falls. If accidents or injuries occur at any of our properties, we may be held liable for costs related to the injuries. We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to businesses in our industry, but there can be no assurance that our liability insurance will be adequate or available at all times and in all circumstances. There can also be no assurance that the liability insurance we have carried in the past was adequate or available to cover any liability related to previous incidents. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed to the extent claims and associated expenses resulting from accidents or injuries exceed our insurance recoveries.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements could impair our financial condition and results of operations or limit our ability to operate our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are often involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including current or former members, guests who use our properties, our employees or regulators. Any significant adverse litigation judgments or settlements could limit our ability to operate our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to comply with regulations relating to public facilities or the failure to retain licenses relating to our properties may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation in the various jurisdictions in which our clubs are located, including regulations relating to alcoholic beverage control, public health and safety, environmental hazards and food safety. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our clubs to obtain licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. The failure of a club to obtain or retain its licenses and permits would adversely affect that club\u2019s operations and profitability. We may also be subject to dram shop statutes in certain states, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Even though we are covered by general liability insurance, a settlement or judgment against us under a dram shop lawsuit in excess of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are also subject to the ADA which, among other things, may require certain renovations to our facilities to comply with access and use requirements. A determination that we are not in compliance with the ADA or any other similar law or regulation could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. While we believe we are operating in substantial compliance, and will continue to remove architectural barriers in our facilities when readily achievable, in accordance with current applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our expenses for compliance with these laws and regulations will not increase significantly and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusinesses operating in the private club industry are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local governmental regulations related to building and zoning requirements and the use and operation of clubs, including changes to building codes and fire and life safety codes, which can affect our ability to obtain and maintain licenses relating to our business and properties. If we were required to make substantial modifications at our clubs to comply with these regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nOur properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental laws. As a result, we may be required to incur costs to comply with the requirements of these laws, such as those relating to water resources, discharges to air, water and land; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under such laws, and we from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historical uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Our club facilities are also subject to risks associated with mold, asbestos and other indoor building contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing regarding our property.\nWe may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements.\nIn addition, some projects to improve, upgrade or expand our golf clubs may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and, for projects in California, the California Environmental Quality Act. Both acts require that a specified government agency study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Our improvement proposals may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may harm our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, state and local governments. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time-consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have an adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, by any of the persons referred to above could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations.\nA failure in our systems or infrastructure which maintain our internal and customer data, or those of our third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could result in faulty business decisions or harm to our reputation or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nCertain information relating to our members and guests, including personally identifiable information and credit card numbers, is collected and maintained by us, or by third-parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities. This information is maintained for a period of time for various business purposes, including maintaining records of member preferences to enhance our customer service and for billing, marketing and promotional purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our members and our employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. Privacy regulation is an evolving area in which different jurisdictions (within or outside the United States) may subject us to inconsistent compliance requirements. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations\nmay increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to service our members and guests and market our properties and services to our members and guests.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, computer viruses or other systems or infrastructure failures. While we have cyber security procedures in place, given the evolving nature of these threats, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future due to cyber attacks or other systems or infrastructure failures. A theft, loss, misappropriation, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, including in connection with one or more cyber attacks on us or one of our third-party providers, could harm our reputation, result in loss of members or business disruption or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third-parties engaged by us) could result in fines or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe operation of our business relies on technology, and operational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the operation of our business. We invest in and license technology and systems for property management, procurement, membership records and specialty programs. We believe that we have designed, purchased and installed appropriate information systems to support our business. There can be no assurance, however, that our information systems and technology will continue to be able to accommodate our requirements and growth, or that the cost of maintaining such systems will not increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate our requirements and growth, or an increase in costs related to maintaining and developing such information systems, including associated labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, there can be no assurance that as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required that we will be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time-frames. In addition, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business. Additionally, while we have cyber security procedures in place, a security breach could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on us. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of our information systems could impair the quality of our operations and could impact our reputation and hence adversely affect our business and limit our ability to grow.\nWe may be required to write-off a portion of our intangible assets with finite lives, indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill, and/or long-lived asset balances as a result of declines in our business, results of operations, or a prolonged and severe economic recession.\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (3) goodwill. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. GAAP also requires that we test long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Declines in our business, results of operations, or a severe prolonged economic downturn could result in impairment charges related to our intangible assets with finite lives, indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill, and/or long-lived assets, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\u2018\u2018IRS\u2019\u2019) and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions and may be subject to similar examinations in the future. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for uncertain tax positions. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments; for example intercompany transactions associated with provision of services and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. We are currently under audit by state income tax authorities. We have received two assessments for our state income tax audits, for a total of $2.5 million which has been recognized within our state income tax payable.\nCertain of our Mexican subsidiaries are under audit by the Mexican taxing authorities for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. We have received two assessments, for approximately $3.0 million each, exclusive of penalties and interest, for two of our Mexican subsidiaries under audit for the 2008 tax year. We have taken the appropriate procedural steps to vigorously contest\nthese assessments through the appropriate Mexican judicial channels. We have not recorded a liability related to these uncertain tax positions as we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail based on the merits of our positions. In 2014, we received an audit assessment for the 2009 tax year for another Mexican subsidiary. We have taken the appropriate procedural steps to contest the assessment through the appropriate Mexican judicial channels. We have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit for $4.7 million, exclusive of penalties and interest, related to this audit. The unrecognized tax benefit has been recorded due to the technical nature of the tax filing position taken by our Mexican subsidiary and uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of this assessment, which we intend to continue to contest.\nManagement believes it is unlikely that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months given the current status in particular of the matters currently under examination by the Mexican tax authorities. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur stock price may experience significant volatility, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid, or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. The stock market experiences significant volatility from time to time. This volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid due to a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance and corporate structure, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation or regulatory investigations or actions;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThese broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to declare and pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn December 2013, our Board of Directors adopted a policy to pay, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the availability of funds, a regular quarterly cash dividend at an indicated annual rate of $0.48 per share of common stock, subject to quarterly declaration. On December 3, 2014, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend, resulting in an indicated annual dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock. The payment of such quarterly dividends and any other future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and is subject to our compliance with applicable law, and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment in ClubCorp. Regardless of whether we pay dividends, this appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our industry, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business or industry. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation designate the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, and therefore limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose a forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought in the name or right of the corporation or on its behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to the corporation or any of our stockholders, (iii) any action arising or asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Chapters 78 or 92A of the Nevada Revised Statutes (\u201cNRS\u201d) or any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our articles of incorporation or bylaws or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation further provide that any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision.\nWe believe the choice-of-forum provision in our amended and restated articles of incorporation will help provide for the orderly, efficient and cost-effective resolution of Nevada-law issues affecting us by designating courts located in the State of Nevada (our state of incorporation) as the exclusive forum for cases involving such issues. However, this provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. While there is no Nevada case law addressing the enforceability of this type of provision, Nevada courts have on prior occasion found persuasive authority in Delaware case law in the absence of Nevada statutory or case law specifically addressing an issue of corporate law. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware ruled in June 2013 that choice-of-forum provisions of a type similar to those included in our amended and restated articles of incorporation are not facially invalid under corporate law and constitute valid and enforceable contractual forum selection clauses. However, if a court were to find the choice-of-forum provision in our amended and restated articles of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of\nthe specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could have the effect of impeding the success of an attempt to acquire us or otherwise effect a change of control;\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings and stockholder action by written consent.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nOur business could be negatively affected because of actions of activist stockholders.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as corporate restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, and the sale of assets. We have experienced activist investors taking ownership positions in our common stock and initiating communications with us. Notwithstanding our current stockholder composition and other factors, it is possible that activist stockholders may attempt to influence the Company to take such corporate actions or may take other measures such as seeking to gain representation on our Board of Directors. Responding to such campaigns could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. Our business could be negatively affected because of the actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value and volatility of our securities.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management team is required to devote substantial time to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nAs a public company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, in order to comply with the rules and regulations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and NYSE. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives and our legal and accounting compliance costs have increased since becoming a public equity filer. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.\nFor example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, as a public company, we are required to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 has resulted in and may continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and that management expend time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could lose investor\nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our stock and our securities to decline.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy, our industry or our business and prevent us from meeting our indebtedness obligations.\nAs of December 29, 2015, we were significantly leveraged and our total indebtedness was approximately $1,113 million. Our substantial degree of leverage could have important consequences for our investors, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures including reinventions, debt service requirements, acquisitions, dividends or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures including reinventions, dividends and other business opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\ncertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or our ability to adjust to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources\nare insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, including reinventions, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the 2015 Senior Notes restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use of the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\nour debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our Secured Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indenture governing the 2015 Senior Notes do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. Additionally, our Secured Credit Facilities include a $175.0 million revolving credit facility, under which we may borrow from time to time. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. The subsidiaries that guarantee the 2015 Senior Notes also guarantee our Secured Credit Facilities.\nRestrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.\nOur Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2015 Senior Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or other amounts;\n\u2022\nsell stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or consolidations.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our Secured Credit Facilities and in the indenture governing the 2015 Senior Notes require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Secured Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the 2015 Senior Notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Secured Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We and our guarantor subsidiaries have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under our Secured Credit Facilities. If the lenders under our Secured Credit Facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we and our guarantor subsidiaries will have sufficient assets to repay our Secured Credit Facilities and our other indebtedness, including the 2015 Senior Notes, or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our interest expense would increase. A hypothetical 0.50% increase in LIBOR rates applicable to borrowings under our variable rate debt instruments would result in an estimated increase of $1.7 million per year of interest expense related to such debt, assuming the term and revolving credit facilities are fully borrowed under our Secured Credit Facilities.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The words \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cpredict\u201d, \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology are used in this Form 10-K to identify forward-looking statements. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements.
