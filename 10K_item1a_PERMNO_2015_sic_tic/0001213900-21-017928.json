{"cik": "1641398", "company": "Code Chain New Continent Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our shares of common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this annual report, before you decide to buy any shares. Any of the following risks could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer materially, causing the market price of our shares of common stock to decline, in which event you may lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem material may also become important factors that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may be further adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and confirmed cases were also reported in other parts of the world. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization\u2019s \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. Our office in Hubei Province, China were closed since the lockdown was enforced on January 23, 2020. The economic disruption caused by COVID-19 were catastrophic for our waste management business in Wuhan, which had no revenue and negative operating income since the fourth quarter of 2019 and no revenue or operating income for the first and second quarter of 2020. We lost employees, suppliers and customers and were not been able to recover. As a result, we sold our businesses located in Wuhan. See \u201cOur Company - Corporate History - Disposition of China Sunlong\u201d. Our offices in Jiangsu Province and Sichuan Province in China were temporarily closed from early February until early March 2020. We have seen a slowdown in revenue growth in first three quarters of 2020.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China and in the U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility.\nOur operating companies, Rong Hai and Wuge, both contractually controlled by the Company, have limited operating histories, which make it difficult to evaluate their businesses and prospects.\nRong Hai began operating in May 2009 and has a limited operating history. Rong Hai generated $18.31 million in revenue in 2017, $17.47 million in revenue in 2018, $19.58 million in 2019 and $11.3 million in 2020. But the past revenue might not be indicative of future performance. Similarly, Wuge commenced operation in October 2019 and is in the development stage. Wuge has generated about $591,455 in revenue in 2020. We cannot guarantee whether Wuge will continue to generate revenue. You should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced by early stage companies in evolving industries, such as the coal products and alternative energy industries and the Internet of Things industry in China. Rong Hai\u2019s and Wuge\u2019s limited history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations. Our operations are subject to all of the risks, challenges, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation of any new business, as well as those risks that are specific to the coal trading industry. Investors should evaluate us in light of the problems and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies attempting to develop markets for new products and technologies. Despite our best efforts, we may never overcome these obstacles.\nWe will continue to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:\n\u25cf obtain sufficient working capital and increase its registered capital to support expansion of our industrial and mining recycling business;\n\u25cf comply with any changes in the laws and regulations of the PRC or local province that may affect our operations;\n\u25cf expand our customer base;\n\u25cf maintain adequate control of default risks and expenses allowing us to realize anticipated revenue growth;\n\u25cf implement our growth strategies and plans and adapt and modify them as needed;\n\u25cf integrate any future business combinations; and\n\u25cf anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the Chinese industrial and mining recycling industry resulting from changes in government regulations, mergers and Business Combinations involving our competitors, and other significant competitive and market dynamics.\nIf we are unable to address any or all of the foregoing risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on a small number of customers, and we will likely continue to be dependent on a small number of customers.\nThree of Company\u2019s customers accounted for 99.1% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We are, and will likely continue to be, dependent on a small number of customers, and the loss of any such customer would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, as a result of our reliance on a limited number of customers, we could face pricing and other competitive pressures which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA significant part of Rong Hai\u2019s revenues is also derived from a small number of customers. Rong Hai expects a small number of customers will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, Nantong Linan Industrial Trading Co. Ltd. accounts for 99.1% of the company\u2019s total sales. The loss of Nantong Linan, or the change of the contractual terms of the contract entered between Rong Hai and Nantong Linan or any significant dispute with Nantong Linan could materially adversely affect its financial condition and its results of operations.\nIf one or more of Rong Hai\u2019s customers does not perform under one or more contracts with it and Rong Hai is not able to find a replacement contract, or if a customer exercises certain rights to terminate the contract, Rong Hai could suffer a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe coal wholesale industry and IoT industry are competitive in China and could cause us to lose market share and revenues in the future.\nThe coal wholesale industry and IoT industry are very competitive in China, and we expect these industries to become more competitive as it begins to consolidate. Some of our competitors will likely have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. As a result, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline, thereby adversely affecting our earnings and potential for growth. While we believe that we will be able to successfully compete in this area as a result of our proprietary technology, there is no assurance that we will be able to hire and retain the necessary employees and compete successfully.\nWuge may be unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our products and services or be unable to establish a significant market presence.\nWuge\u2019s growth strategy for is substantially dependent upon our ability to market our intended products and services successfully to prospective clients in China. This requires that we heavily rely upon our development and marketing partners. Failure to select the right development and marketing partners will significantly delay or prohibit our ability to develop our intended products and services, market the products and gain market acceptance. Our intended products and services may not achieve significant market acceptance. If acceptance is achieved, it may not be sustained for any significant period of time. Failure of our intended products and services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations.\nIf potential users within the target markets do not widely adopt Code Chain technology and IoT services or Wuge fails to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, we will not generate sufficient revenue, if at all, and our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWuge may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and, therefore, may never generate substantial revenue or allow us to achieve or maintain profitability. Widespread adoption of Code Chain technology and IoT services in China depends on many factors, including acceptance by users that such systems and methods or other options. Our ability to achieve commercial market acceptance for Wuge or any other future products also depends on the strength of our sales, marketing and distribution organizations.\nCyber security risks could adversely affect Wuge\u2019s busines and disrupt its operations.\nThe threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, Wuge\u2019s products devices and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, and loss of consumer confidence.\nIn addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber attack that attempts to obtain our data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation.\nAn assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses and our business could be harmed.\nThe technology industries involving IoT devices, software and services are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Much of this litigation involves patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own patent portfolio may provide little or no deterrence.\nWe cannot assure you that we, our subsidiaries or our variable interest entities will prevail in any future intellectual property infringement or other litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us or our subsidiaries to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we, our subsidiaries or our variable interest entities could be obligated to indemnify our customers against third parties\u2019 claims of intellectual property infringement based on our products or solutions. If our products or solutions violate any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to withdraw them from the market, re-develop them or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop our products or solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favourable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Withdrawal of any of our products or solutions from the market could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to manage Rong Hai and Wuge effectively since its acquisition could materially impact our business.\nThe recent acquisition of Rong Hai and Wuge have placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on the Company\u2019s management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. The Company\u2019s success will depend in part on its ability to manage Rong Hai and Wuge effectively. To manage the recent and expected growth of its operations and personnel, the Company will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and its reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage Rong Hai and Wuge could result in difficulty or delays in deploying the Company\u2019s services to customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business performance and results of operations.\nRong Hai\u2019s business and results of operations are dependent on the PRC coal markets, which may be cyclical.\nAs its revenue is substantially derived from the sale of steam coal, Rong Hai\u2019s business and operating results are substantially dependent on the domestic supply of steam coal. The PRC coal market is cyclical and exhibits fluctuation in supply and demand from year to year and is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions in the PRC, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in industries with high demand for coal, such as the utilities and steel industries. Fluctuations in supply and demand for coal affects coal prices which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on our operating and financial performance. The demand for coal is primarily affected by overall economic development and the demand for coal from the electricity generation, steel and construction industries. The supply of coal, on the other hand, is primarily affected by the geographic location of the coal supplies, the volume of coal produced by domestic and international coal suppliers, and the quality and price of competing sources of coal. Alternative fuels such as natural gas and oil, alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric power and nuclear power, and international shipping costs also impact the market demand for coal. Excess demand for coal may increase coal prices, which would have an adverse effect on the cost of goods sold which would, in turn, cause a short-term decline in our profitability if we are unable to increase the price of our steam coal to our customers. Local government may regulate residential winter heating prices so they are not increased above a certain threshold, thus our residential heating customers may not be able to pay higher steam coal prices. As a result, Rong Hai may not be able to increase its steam coal price in response to any increase in coal price or Rong Hai may have to decrease its steam coal price when it renews contracts with its customers. As a result, Rong Hai may not able to keep its gross margin.\nOur results of operations are subject, to a significant extent, to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC.\nAll of the sales of Rong Hai and Wuge were made to customers based in the PRC. We expect that a majority of their sales will continue to be made to customers based in the PRC. Accordingly, the economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the PRC may affect our business. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including: (i) structure; (ii) level of government involvement; (iii) level of development; (iv) growth rate; (v) control of foreign exchange and (vi) allocation of resources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces in the development of the PRC economy. Changes in the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, the PRC government indirectly influences coal prices through its regulation of power tariffs and its control over the allocation of the transportation capacity of the national rail system. Any significant downturn in coal prices in the PRC could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the PRC government could adopt new policies that could shift demand away from coal to other energy sources. Any significant decline in demand for, or over-supply of, coal could materially and adversely affect our revenues from coal export sales.\nCompetition could put downward pressure on coal prices and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nRong Hai competes with numerous other domestic and foreign coal producers for domestic sales. Overcapacity and increased production within the domestic coal industry, and decelerating steel demand in Asia have at times, and could in the future, materially reduce coal prices and therefore could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade policies, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than China. We may not be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, our ability to ship our coal to international customers depends on port capacity, which is limited. Increased competition within the coal industry for international sales could result in us not being able to obtain throughput capacity at port facilities, or could result in the rates for such throughput capacity increasing to a point where it is not economically feasible to export our coal.\nThe domestic coal industry has experienced consolidation in recent years, including consolidation among some of our major competitors. In addition, substantial overcapacity exists in the coal industry and several other large coal companies have also filed, and others may file, bankruptcy proceedings which could enable them to lower their productions costs and thereby reduce the price for their coal, which in turn could adversely affect our revenues if we are not able to similarly reduce our prices. Consolidation in the coal industry or current or future bankruptcy proceedings of our coal competitors could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn addition to competing with other coal producers, Rong Hai competes generally with producers of other fuels, such as natural gas. Natural gas pricing has declined significantly in recent years. The decline in the price of natural gas has caused demand for coal to decrease and adversely affected the price of our coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices have also contributed to utilities phasing out or closing existing coal-fired power plants and continued low prices could reduce or eliminate construction of any new coal-fired power plants. This trend has, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal. Moreover, the construction of new pipelines and other natural gas distribution channels may increase competition within regional markets and thereby decrease the demand for and price of our coal.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements. Such reduced disclosure may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Item 10 of the Regulation S-K, we will elect to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the ability to include only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nThe failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to mergers and acquisition of domestic enterprises by offshore special purpose vehicles may subject the Company to severe fines or penalties and create other regulatory uncertainties regarding the Company\u2019s corporate structure.\nOn August 8, 2006, the Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), joined by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d), the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d), the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (the \u201cSAIC\u201d), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d), jointly promulgated regulations entitled the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), which took effect as of September 8, 2006, and as amended on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, has certain provisions that require offshore companies formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC individuals and companies which are the related parties with the PRC domestic companies, to obtain the approval of MOFCOM prior to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing special purpose vehicles\u2019 securities on an overseas stock market. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.\nThe application of the M&A Rules with respect to the Company\u2019s corporate structure remains unclear, with no current consensus existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules. We believe that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals under the M&A Rules are not required in the context of the contractual arrangements with Rong Hai and Wuge, our operating entities in China, because both Tongrong WFOE and Makesi WFOE were incorporated as wholly owned foreign investment enterprise with the approval of local department of commerce. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC and MOFCOM, would reach the same conclusion, and we cannot be certain that MOFCOM or the CSRC will not deem that the contractual arrangements circumvent the M&A Rules, and other rules and notices, or that prior MOFCOM or CSRC approval is required for overseas financing.\nIf the CSRC, MOFCOM, or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that CSRC, MOFCOM or other approval was required for the contractual arrangement with Rong Hai and Wuge, our operating entities in China, or if prior CSRC approval for overseas financings is required and not obtained, the Company may face severe regulatory actions or other sanctions from MOFCOM, the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from overseas financings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares of common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to delay or cancel overseas financings, to restructure the Company\u2019s corporate structure, or to seek regulatory approvals that may be difficult or costly to obtain.\nThe M&A Rules, along with certain foreign exchange regulations discussed below, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our future acquisition strategy.\nPRC regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject The Company\u2019s PRC-resident beneficial owners or its PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into its PRC subsidiaries or limit its PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits.\nSAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as \u201cSAFE Circular 75\u201d promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC resident holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.\nSAFE promulgated the Notice of SAFE on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange Administration of Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, on February 13, 2015, which was effective on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 13 cancels two administrative approval items: foreign exchange registration under domestic direct investment and foreign exchange registration under overseas direct investment, instead. Banks shall directly examine and handle foreign exchange registration under domestic direct investment and foreign exchange registration under overseas direct investment, and SAFE and its branch shall indirectly regulate the foreign exchange registration of direct investment through banks.\nThe Company may not be aware of the identities of all of its beneficial owners who are PRC residents. The Company does not have control over its beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of its PRC-resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37, SAFE Circular 13 and subsequent rules implemented by SAFE. The failure of the Company\u2019s beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, SAFE Circular 13 and subsequent implementation rules, or the failure of future beneficial owners of the Company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37, SAFE Circular 13 and subsequent implementation rules, may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Furthermore, since SAFE Circular 37 and SAFE Circular 13 was recently promulgated and it is unclear how such regulations, and any future regulations concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, the Company cannot predict how these regulations will affect its business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit the Company\u2019s ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries and limit its PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to the Company. These risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Rong Hai or Wuge fails to maintain the requisite licenses and approvals required under PRC law, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nForeign investment is highly regulated by the PRC government and local authorities. Rong Hai and Wuge are required to obtain and maintain certain licenses or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to operate their respective current businesses. These licenses and approvals are essential to the operation of their businesses, for example, the value-added telecommunication business carried out by Wuge. If Rong Hai and Wuge fail to obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals for its business, we may be subject to various penalties, such as fines and the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption in the business operations of Rong Hai and Wuge could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our businesses in China do not comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations or their interpretations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.\nPRC laws and regulations impose certain restrictions and prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in Internet and other related businesses. The Special Administrative Measures for Entrance of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2020 Version) provides that foreign investors are generally not allowed to own more than 50% of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunication service provider other than an e-commerce service provider, among others, and the Provisions on the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises (2016 Revision) requires that the major foreign investor in a value-added telecommunication service provider in China must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications services overseas and maintain a good track record.\nTo ensure compliance with the PRC laws and regulations, our wholly owned subsidiary, or WFOE, conduct our business in China mainly through our Wuge based on a series of contractual arrangements by and among our WFOE, our VIE and the respective shareholders of our VIE, which enable us to (i) exercise effective control over our VIEs, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of our VIEs, and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests and assets in our VIEs when and to the extent permitted by PRC law. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we have control over and are the primary beneficiary of our VIE and hence consolidate their financial results into our consolidated financial statements under IFRS. See \u201cCorporate History and Structure\u201d for further details.\nIf the contractual arrangements among our WFOEs, our VIEs and their respective shareholders are determined to be illegal or invalid, or if we or our VIEs fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations or failures, including:\n\u25cf revoking the business license and/or operating license of such entities;\n\u25cf placing restrictions on our operations or our right to collect revenues;\n\u25cf imposing fines, confiscating the income from our WFOEs or VIEs, or imposing other requirements with which we or our VIEs may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual arrangements and deregistering equity pledges made by the shareholders of our VIEs, which in turn would affect our ability to consolidate, derive economic interests from, or exert effective control over our VIEs;\n\u25cf restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds of any offering to finance our business and operations in China; or\n\u25cf taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties could cause us to lose our right to direct the activities of our VIEs or our right to receive substantially all of the economic benefits and residual returns from our VIEs and result in a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. In addition, it is unclear what impact these actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of our VIEs in our consolidated financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our legal structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations. If we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a manner satisfactory to relevant PRC regulatory authorities, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the newly enacted PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance, business operations and financial results.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People\u2019s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Foreign Owned Enterprise Law as the legal basis for foreign investment in the PRC. The Foreign Investment Law defines the \u201cforeign investment\u201d as investment activities in China conducted directly or indirectly by foreign investors in the following manners: (i) the foreign investor, by itself or together with other investors, establishes a foreign invested enterprise in China; (ii) the foreign investor acquires shares, equities, asset tranches, or similar rights and interests of enterprises in China; (iii) the foreign investor, by itself or together with other investors, invests in and establishes new projects in China; or (iv) the foreign investor invests through other approaches as stipulated by laws, administrative regulations or as otherwise regulated by the State Council. However, since the Foreign Investment Law is relatively new, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. While the Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, it is possible that foreign investment via contractual arrangements may be interpreted as a type of indirect foreign investment activity that falls within the definition of \u201cforeign investment\u201d or future laws, administrative regulations or provisions promulgated by the State Council.\nIn any of these cases, our contractual arrangements may be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment under the PRC laws and regulations. Furthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nA slowdown of the Chinese economy or adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could negatively impact China\u2019s overall economic growth, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are a holding company and all of the combined company\u2019s operations are entirely conducted in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown in recent years, the pace of growth has slowed, and even that rate of growth may not continue. The annual rate of growth in the PRC declined from 6.6% in 2018 to 6.1% in 2019. According to a recent State Information of China forecast, China\u2019s economic growth rate in 2020 will slow to 6.0%, its lowest since 1990. A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC may materially reduce the demand for the combined company\u2019s products and may have a materially adverse effect on its business.\nChina\u2019s economy differs from the economies of most other countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement in the economy, the general level of economic development, growth rates and government control of foreign exchange and the allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has grown significantly over the past few decades, this growth has remained uneven across different periods, regions and economic sectors.\nThe PRC government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth by allocating resources, controlling the payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Any actions and policies adopted by the PRC government could negatively impact the Chinese economy or the economy of the region the combined company serves, which could materially adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business.\nSubstantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business the combined company may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of its operations and financial condition.\nThe combined company\u2019s business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over the manner in which the combined company must conduct its business activities. The combined company\u2019s ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activities and greater economic decentralization. However, the government of the PRC may not continue to pursue these policies, or may significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing the Company\u2019s business, or the enforcement and performance of the Company\u2019s arrangements with borrowers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, death, bankruptcy or criminal proceedings. Only after 1979 did the Chinese government begin to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws that regulate economic affairs in general, deal with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, as well as encourage foreign investment in China. Although the influence of the law has been increasing, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Also, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. In addition, there have been constant changes and amendments of laws and regulations over the past 30 years in order to keep up with the rapidly changing society and economy in China. Because government agencies and courts provide interpretations of laws and regulations and decide contractual disputes and issues, their inexperience in adjudicating new business and new polices or regulations in certain less developed areas causes uncertainty and may affect the Company\u2019s business. Consequently, we cannot predict the future direction of Chinese legislative activities with respect to either businesses with foreign investment or the effectiveness on enforcement of laws and regulations in China. The uncertainties, including new laws and regulations and changes of existing laws, as well as judicial interpretation by inexperienced officials in the agencies and courts in certain areas, may cause possible problems to foreign investors, including investors in shares of our common stock.\nRong Hai\u2019s and Wuge\u2019s business is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by state, provincial and local government authorities, which may interfere with the way the Company conducts its business and may negatively impact its financial results.\nRong Hai and Wuge is subject to extensive and complex state, provincial and local laws, rules and regulations with regard to its loan operations, capital structure, maximum interest rates, allowance for loan losses, among other things, as set out in \u201cBusiness - Government Regulations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on April 17, 2020, and Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on May 14, 2020. These laws, rules and regulations are issued by different central government ministries and departments, provincial and local governments and are enforced by different local authorities in China\u2019s Hubei Province, the city of Wuhan, the city of Suzhou, and the city of Chengdu. As a result of the complexity, uncertainties and constant changes in these laws, rules and regulation, including changes in interpretation and implementation of such, Rong Hai\u2019s and Wuge\u2019s business activities and growth may be adversely affected if it does not respond to such changes in a timely manner or is found to be in violation of the applicable laws, regulations and policies as a result of a position taken by the relevant competent authority in the interpretation of such applicable laws, regulations and policies that is different from Rong Hai\u2019s and Wuge\u2019s position. If Rong Hai or Wuge is found to be not in compliance with such laws and regulations, it may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities, monetary penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business operations and profitability.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions against us or our management, in China, based upon United States laws, including the U.S. federal securities laws, or other foreign laws.\nWe are a company incorporated in Nevada. After the Business Combination, substantially all of our operations will be conducted in China, and substantially all of our assets will be located in China. All of our current and proposed directors and officers reside in China, and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, Allbright Law, our counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nAllbright Law has further advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors or officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws, national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nAllbright Law has also advised us that in the event shareholders originate an action against a company without domicile in China for disputes related to contracts or other property interests, the PRC courts may accept a cause of action if (a) the disputed contract is concluded or performed in the PRC or the disputed subject matter is located in the PRC, (b) the company (as defendant) has properties that can be seized within the PRC, (c) the company has a representative organization within the PRC, or (d) the parties chose to submit to the jurisdiction of the PRC courts in the contract on the condition that such submission does not violate the requirements of jurisdiction under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The action may be initiated by the shareholder by filing a complaint with the PRC courts. The PRC courts would determine whether to accept the complaint in accordance with the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The shareholder may participate in the action by itself or entrust any other person or PRC legal counsel to participate on behalf of such shareholder. Foreign citizens and companies will have the same rights as PRC citizens and companies in such an action unless such foreign country restricts the rights of PRC citizens and companies.\nOur ability to pay dividends may be restricted due to foreign exchange control and other regulations of China.\nAs an offshore holding company, we will rely principally on dividends from our subsidiary in China, WFOE, for our cash requirements. Under the applicable PRC laws and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside a portion of its after-tax profit to fund specific reserve funds prior to payment of dividends. In particular, at least 10% of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards each year is required to be set aside towards its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.\nFurthermore, WFOE\u2019s ability to pay dividends may be restricted due to foreign exchange control policies and the availability of its cash balance. Substantially all of the Operating Companies\u2019 operations are conducted in China and all of the revenue we recognize, through WFOE will be denominated in RMB. RMB is subject to exchange control regulation in China, and, as a result, WFOE may be unable to distribute any dividends outside of China due to PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into U.S. dollars.\nThe lack of dividends or other payments from WFOE may limit our ability to make investments or Business Combinations that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends or otherwise fund, and conduct our business. Our funds may not be readily available to us to satisfy obligations which have been incurred outside the PRC, which could adversely affect our business and prospects or our ability to meet our cash obligations. Accordingly, if we do not receive dividends from WFOE, our liquidity and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nDividends payable to our foreign investors and gains on the sale of our shares of common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to tax by the PRC.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation regulations issued by the State Council of the PRC, a 10% PRC withholding tax is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are non-resident enterprises, which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or which have such establishment or place of business but the dividends are not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of shares by such investors is also subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 10%, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in relevant tax treaties, if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. If we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid on our shares, and any gain realized from the transfer of our shares, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and would as a result be subject to PRC taxation. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends payable to individual investors who are non-PRC residents and any gain realized on the transfer shares by such investors may be subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 20%, subject to any reduction or exemption set forth in applicable tax treaties. It is unclear whether we or any of our subsidiaries established outside of China are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or areas. If dividends payable to our non-PRC investors, or gains from the transfer of our shares by such investors are subject to PRC tax, the value of your investment in our shares may decline significantly.\nOur global income may be subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the New EIT Law, and its amendment and implementation rules, which became effective in January 2008, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a \u201cde facto management body\u201d located within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules define the term \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as \u201cestablishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finance and treasury, and Business Combination and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise.\u201d On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation (the \u201cSAT\u201d), issued a circular, or SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \u201cde facto management body\u201d of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although the SAT Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the SAT Circular 82 may reflect the SAT\u2019s general position on how the \u201cde facto management body\u201d text should be applied in determining the resident status of all offshore enterprises for the purpose of PRC tax, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Although we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside of the PRC constitute PRC resident enterprises, it is possible that the PRC tax authorities could reach a different conclusion. In such case, we may be considered a PRC resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to the 25% enterprise income tax on our global income, which could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. In addition to the uncertainty regarding how the new PRC resident enterprise classification for tax purposes may apply, it is also possible that the rules may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect.\nWe and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the State Administration of Taxation issued an Announcement on Several Issues Concerning Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Announcement 7, with the same effective date. Under Announcement 7, an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d refers to a transaction where a non-resident enterprise transfers its equity interest and other similar interest in an offshore holding company, which directly or indirectly holds Chinese taxable assets (the assets of an \u201cestablishment or place\u201d situated in China; real property situated in China and equity interest in Chinese resident enterprises) and any indirect transfer without reasonable commercial purposes are subject to the PRC taxation. In addition, Announcement 7 specifies the conditions under which an indirect transfer is deemed to lack a reasonable commercial purpose which include: (1) 75% or more of the value of the offshore holding company\u2019s equity is derived from Chinese taxable assets, (2) anytime in the year prior to the occurrence of the indirect transfer of Chinese taxable assets, 90% or more of the total assets (excluding cash) of the offshore holding company are direct or indirect investment in China, or 90% or more of the revenue of the offshore holding company was sourced from China; (3) the functions performed and risks assumed by the offshore holding company(ies), although incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction to conform to the corporate law requirements there, are insufficient to substantiate their corporate existence and (4) the foreign income tax payable in respect of the indirect transfer is lower than the Chinese tax which would otherwise be payable in respect of the direct transfer if such transfer were treated as a direct transfer. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, currently at a rate of 10%.\nAnnouncement 7 grants a safe harbor under certain qualifying circumstances, including transfers in the public securities market and certain intragroup restricting transactions, however, there is uncertainty as to the implementation of Announcement 7. For example, Announcement 7 requires the buyer to withhold the applicable taxes without specifying how to obtain the information necessary to calculate taxes and when the applicable tax shall be submitted. Announcement 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our offshore restructuring transactions or sale of the shares of our offshore subsidiaries where non-resident enterprises, being the transferors, were involved. Though Announcement 7 does not impose a mandatory obligation of filing the report of taxable events, the transferring party shall be subject to PRC withholding tax if the certain tax filing conditions are met. Non-filing may result in an administrative penalty varying from 50% to 300% of unpaid taxes. As a result, we and our non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to taxation under Announcement 7, and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Announcement 7 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprises should not be taxed under Announcement 7, for any restructuring or disposal of shares of our offshore subsidiaries, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in the future.\nThe PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of certain taxable assets, including, in particular, equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by a non-resident enterprise by promulgating and implementing SAT Circular 59 and Circular 698, which became effective in January 2008, and a Circular 7 in replacement of some of the existing rules in Circular 698, which became effective in February 2015.\nUnder Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d by transferring the equity interests of a PRC \u201cresident enterprise\u201d indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.\nIn February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.\nWe face uncertainties on the reporting and consequences on future private equity financing transactions, share exchange or other transactions involving the transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises. The PRC tax authorities may pursue such non-resident enterprises with respect to a filing or the transferees with respect to withholding obligation, and request our PRC subsidiaries to assist in the filing. As a result, we and non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to filing obligations or being taxed, under Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprises should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PRC tax authorities have the discretion under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment. We may pursue acquisitions in the future that may involve complex corporate structures. If we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under SAT Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, our income tax costs associated with such potential acquisitions will be increased, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenue effectively.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently convertible under the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \u201ccapital account,\u201d which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC subsidiaries, which are wholly-foreign owned enterprises, may purchase foreign currency for settlement of \u201ccurrent account transactions,\u201d including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside of the PRC or pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE or banks and other relevant PRC governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for all of our PRC subsidiaries.\nFluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and Renminbi could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate. Exchange rates are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under this policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of foreign currencies. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over three years. From July 2008 until June 2010, however, the RMB traded stably within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. On June 20, 2010, the PBOC announced that the PRC government would reform the RMB exchange rate regime and increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. In April 2012, the PRC government announced it would allow greater RMB exchange rate fluctuation. On August 11, 12 and 13, 2015, the PRC government successively set the central parity rate for the RMB more than 3% lower in the aggregate than that of August 10, 2015 and announced that it will begin taking into account previous day\u2019s trading in setting the central parity rate. In 2015, the yuan experienced a 4.88% drop in value, and on January 4, 2016 the PRC government set the U.S. dollar-Chinese yuan currency pair to a reference rate of 6.5%, the lowest rate in 4.5 years, on January 6, 2017, the reference rate was 0.9% up-regulated by the PRC government. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. As significant international pressure remains on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result.\nOur revenues and costs are mostly denominated in the RMB, and a significant portion of our financial assets are also denominated in the RMB. Any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar may materially adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the amount of and any dividends we may pay on our shares in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar could also result in foreign currency translation losses for financial reporting purposes.\nIf any dividend is declared in the future and paid in a foreign currency, you may be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. dollars than the U.S. dollar amount that you will actually ultimately receive.\nIf you are a U.S. holder of our shares of common stock, you will be taxed on the U.S. dollar value of your dividends, if any, at the time you receive them, even if you actually receive a smaller amount of U.S. dollars when the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Specifically, if a dividend is declared and paid in a foreign currency such as the RMB, the amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the payments made in the foreign currency, determined at the spot rate of the foreign currency to the U.S. dollar on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Thus, if the value of the foreign currency decreases before you actually convert the currency into U.S. dollars, you will be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. dollars than the U.S. dollar amount that you will actually ultimately receive.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit economic activity and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s operations.\nThe Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion in recent years which can lead to high rates of inflation or deflation. This has caused the PRC government to, from time to time, enact various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the PRC government to once again impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China. Any action on the part of the PRC government that seeks to control credit and/or prices may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business operations.\nPRC laws and regulations have established more complex procedures for certain acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for the combined company to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nFurther to the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the New M&A Rules, the Anti-monopoly Law of the PRC, the Rules of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by MOFCOM or the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, was issued in August 2011, which established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change of control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC enterprise, or that the approval from MOFCOM be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. PRC laws and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to merger control review and or security review.\nThe MOFCOM Security Review Rules, effective from September 1, 2011, which implement the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated on February 3, 2011, further provide that, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to the security review by MOFCOM, the principle of substance over form should be applied and foreign investors are prohibited from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through agreements control or offshore transactions. In addition, Measures for Security Review of Foreign Investment stipulated by NDRC and MOFCOM on December 19, 2020, effective on January 18, 2021, which also provides that security review shall be conducted for the foreign investments that affect or may affect national security\nFurther, if the business of any target company that the combined company seek to acquire falls into the scope of security review, the combined company may not be able to successfully acquire such company either by equity or asset acquisition, capital contribution or through any contractual agreements. The combined company may grow its business in part by acquiring other companies operating in its industry. Complying with the requirements of the relevant regulations to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including approval from MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit its ability to complete such transactions, which could affect its ability to maintain or expand its market share.\nIn addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Circular 19, on June 1, 2015. Under Circular 19, registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and the equity investments in the PRC made by the foreign-invested company shall be subject to the relevant laws and regulations about the foreign-invested company\u2019s reinvestment in the PRC. In addition, foreign-invested companies cannot use such capital to make the investments on securities, and cannot use such capital to issue the entrusted RMB loans (except approved in its business scope), repay the RMB loans between the enterprises and the ones which have been transferred to the third party. Circular 19 may significantly limit our ability to effectively use the proceeds from future financing activities as the Chinese subsidiaries may not convert the funds received from us in foreign currencies into RMB, which may adversely affect their liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business in the PRC.\nSAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts (\u201cCircular 16\u201d), on June 9, 2016, which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purpose beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC Laws or regulations, while such converted RMB shall not be provide as loans to its non-affiliated entities. As Circular 16 is newly issued and SAFE has not provided detailed guidelines with respect to its interpretation or implementation, it is uncertain how these rules will be interpreted and implemented.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nAs our shares are listed on Nasdaq, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Non-U.S. companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions. In addition, in 2012, the central government of the PRC commenced a far-reaching campaign against corruption. That ongoing campaign involves aggressive enforcement of existing Chinese anti-corruption laws. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in the PRC. Our employees or other agents may engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSEC administrative proceedings against the China affiliates of multi-national accounting firms, and/or any related adverse regulatory development in the PRC, may result in our financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.\nIn December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against five major accounting firms in China alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other China-based companies under investigation by the SEC. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of these firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The decision is neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. On February 12, 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms appealed to the SEC against this decision. In February 2015, each of the four PRC-based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC. The settlement requires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms\u2019 audit documents via the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission. If the firms do not follow these procedures, the SEC could restart the administrative proceedings.\nIn the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings or initiates new proceedings against other firms, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our shares may be adversely affected.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm was denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to our delisting from Nasdaq or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our shares in the United States.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations and our reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our shares, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our company and our business. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend the Company. This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely hampered and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC.\nOur reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Our SEC filings and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review by CSRC, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no PRC regulator has conducted any review of our Company, our SEC reports, other filings with non-PRC regulatory authorities or any of our other public pronouncements outside the U.S.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nA market for the Company\u2019s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our common stock.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of the Company\u2019s securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, the Nasdaq Capital Market for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there has traditionally only been a small market for our shares of common stock. For example, in the month of September 2020, our average volume per trading day was under 5,000 shares. While there have been, and there may continue to be days of exceptionally high volume, our shares may always remain \u201cthinly-traded\u201d, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including that we are relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our shares may be sustained.\nWe could issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests and impairing their voting rights; and provisions in our charter documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur articles of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of up to 20,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. As of the date of this report, no shares of preferred stock have been designated. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. For example, it would be possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of our Company.\nOur executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and could be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of March 25, 2021, our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 29.59% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, our executive officers and directors have influence to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the ability to defeat the election of our directors, amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or by-laws or effect or prevent a change in corporate control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination. In addition, any sale of a significant amount of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Management\u2019s stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing any gains from our common stock.\nAdditional stock offerings in the future may dilute then-existing shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership of the Company.\nGiven our plans and expectations that we will need additional capital in the future, we anticipate that we will need to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of common stock, including convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock options or warrants. The issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage ownership of then current stockholders and could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s securities may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the 12 months prior to March 24, 2021, our common stock has traded at a low of $0.70 and a high of $11.62. From the beginning of 2021 through March 24, 2021, our common stock has traded at a low of $1.79 and a high of $11.62 irrespective of our operating performance and with no discernable announcements or developments by the company or third parties. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for companies such as us in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. A decline in the market price of our common stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional shares of common stock or other of our securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf success of competitors;\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the lending market in general;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced services on a timely basis;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets as needed;\n\u25cf changes in the Company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the volume of common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf any major change in our board or management;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nA possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to additional price volatility.\nHistorically there has not been a large short position in our common stock. However, in the future investors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent an aggregate short exposure in our common stock becomes significant, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to purchase shares for delivery to share lenders at times if and when the price of our common stock increases significantly, particularly over a short period of time. Those purchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to our business prospects, financial performance or other traditional measures of value for the Company or its common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Conversion\nYour rights as a stockholder of the Company will change as a result of the Conversion and you may not be afforded as many rights as a shareholder of the Company as an exempted company in Cayman Islands under applicable laws and the memorandum and articles of association (the \u201cProposed Articles\u201d) to be adopted after the Conversion under Cayman Islands law as you were as a stockholder of the Company under applicable laws and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws under Nevada law.\nBecause of differences between Nevada law and Cayman Islands law, we will be unable to adopt identical governing documents after the Conversion, but we have attempted to preserve in the Proposed Articles after the Conversion the same allocation of material rights and powers between the stockholder and our Board that exists under the current Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation before the Conversion. Nevertheless, the Proposed Articles differ from the Company\u2019s Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation, both in form and substance, and your rights as a shareholder will change. For example:\n\u25cf Under the NRS, a corporation may not engage in a business in combination with an interested stockholder for a period of two years after the time of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder. However, there is no equivalent provision under the Companies Law or the Proposed Articles prohibiting business combinations with interested stockholders.\n\u25cf Under the NRS, any stockholder may, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, inspect the corporation\u2019s books and records for a proper purpose during the usual hours for business. However, shareholders of a Cayman Islands exempted company do not have any general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records of such company, and the Proposed Articles provide that the directors have the discretion as to whether, to what extent, when, where and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company may be open to the inspection of shareholders who are not directors.\n\u25cf Under the NRS, a stockholder may bring a derivative suit provided the requirements to do so under the NRS have been met. However, as a general rule, a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder of a Cayman Islands exempted company, and a minority shareholder may be entitled to bring a derivative action on behalf of the Company after the Conversion only in certain limited circumstances.\nThe laws of the Cayman Islands may not provide our shareholders with benefits comparable to those provided to shareholders of corporations incorporated in the United States.\nAfter the Conversion, our corporate affairs will be governed by the Proposed Articles, by the Companies Law, and by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to the Company under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law in the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands and from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of its directors, although clearly established under Cayman Islands law, are not specifically prescribed in statute or a particular document in the same way that they are in certain statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions of the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws relative to the United States. Therefore, our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. In addition, shareholders of Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the United States. There is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would entertain original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against the Company predicated upon the civil liabilities provisions of U.S. securities laws.\nAs a result of different shareholder voting requirements in the Cayman Islands relative to Nevada, we will have less flexibility with respect to our ability to amend our constitutional documents and enter into certain business combinations than we now have.\nUnder Nevada law and our current Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation may be amended by the vote of a majority of shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter to approve the amendment, unless the Articles of Incorporation requires the vote of a greater number of shares. Cayman Islands law requires a special resolution of at least two-thirds of the shareholder votes cast by those shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting for any amendment to the Proposed Articles. As a result of this Cayman Islands law requirement, situations may arise where the flexibility we now have under Nevada law would have provided benefits to our stockholders that will not be available in the Cayman Islands.\nIn addition, under Cayman Islands law and the Proposed Articles, certain corporate transactions, such as a merger, require the approval of a special resolution of at least two-thirds of the shareholder votes cast by those shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting or, if the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the sanction of a special resolution at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. By contrast, a merger under Nevada law would only require a simple majority of the outstanding stock of the company entitled to vote thereon. The increased shareholder approval requirements may limit our flexibility to enter into or complete certain business combinations that may be beneficial to shareholders.\nThe expected benefits of the Conversion may not be realized.\nWe cannot be assured that all of the goals of the Conversion will be achievable, and some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Conversion may not occur, particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control. These factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors and analysts. In addition, the anticipated reduction of SEC reporting requirements and related expenses may not be achieved in the event of changes to the SEC rules applicable to foreign private issuers or if we fail to qualify as a foreign private issuer. While we expect the Conversion will enable us to reduce our operational, administrative, legal and accounting costs over the long term, these benefits may not be achieved.\nFollowing the completion of the Conversion, as a foreign private issuer, we will not be required to provide its shareholders with the same information as the Company would if the Company remained a U.S. public issuer and, as a result, you may not receive as much information about the Company as you did about the Company and you may not be afforded the same level of protection as a shareholder under applicable laws and the Proposed Articles as you were as a stockholder under applicable laws and the Company Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\nFollowing the completion of the Conversion, we are expected to qualify as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the rules and regulations of the SEC. We will remain subject to the mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and, as long as our ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq, the governance and disclosure rules of that stock exchange. However, as a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that would otherwise apply if we were a company incorporated in the United States or did not meet the other conditions to qualify as a foreign private issuer. For example:\n\u25cf we may include in its SEC filings financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or with IFRS as issued by the IASB without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP;\n\u25cf we will not be required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently or as promptly, as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. For example, we will not be required to file current reports on Form 8-K within four business days from the occurrence of specific material events. Instead, we will need to promptly furnish reports on Form 6-K any information that we (a) make or are required to make public under the laws of the Cayman Islands, (b) file or are required to file under the rules of any stock exchange or (c) otherwise distribute or are required to distribute to its shareholders. Unlike Form 8-K, there is no precise deadline by which Form 6-K must be furnished. In addition, we will not be required to file its annual report on Form 10-K, which may be due as soon as 60 days after its fiscal year end. As a foreign private issuer, we will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months after its fiscal year end;\n\u25cf we will not be required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;\n\u25cf we will not be required to conduct advisory votes on executive compensation;\n\u25cf we will be exempt from filing quarterly reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC;\n\u25cf we will not be subject to the requirement to comply with Regulation FD, which imposes certain restrictions on the selected disclosure of material information;\n\u25cf we will not be required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and\n\u25cf we will not be required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any \u201cshort-swing\u201d trading transaction.\nWe expect to take advantage of these exemptions if the Conversion is effected. Accordingly, after the completion of the Conversion, if you hold our securities, you may receive less information about the Company and our business than you currently receive and be afforded less protection under the U.S. federal securities laws than you are entitled to currently. However, consistent with our policy of seeking input from, and engaging in discussions with, our stockholders, on executive compensation matters, we intend to provide disclosure relating to its executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices and conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation once every three years after the Conversion is effected. However, we expect to review this practice after the next such advisory vote and may at that time or in the future determine to conduct such advisory votes more frequently or to not conduct them at all.\nIf we fail to qualify as a foreign private issuer upon completion of the Conversion, or loses its status as a foreign private issuer at some future time, we would be required to comply fully with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers and would incur significant operational, administrative, legal and accounting costs that it would not incur as a foreign private issuer.\nFollowing completion of the Conversion, we are expected to qualify as a \u201cforeign private issuer\u201d under the rules and regulations of the SEC. As a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that would otherwise apply if we were a company incorporated in the United States or did not meet the other conditions to qualify as a foreign private issuer. Please see the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to the Conversion-As a foreign private issuer, we will not be required to provide its shareholders with the same information as the Company would if the Company remained a U.S. public issuer and, as a result, you may not receive as much information about we as you did about the Company and you may not be afforded the same level of protection as a shareholder under applicable laws and the Proposed Articles as you were as a stockholder under applicable laws and the Company Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.\u201d While we are expected to qualify as a foreign private issuer following the completion of the Conversion, if we fail to qualify as a foreign private issuer upon completion of the Conversion, or loses its status as a foreign private issuer at some future time, we will be required to comply fully with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers and would incur significant operational, administrative, legal and accounting costs that it would not incur as a foreign private issuer.\nIf we prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS following the Conversion, there may be a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nThe SEC permits foreign private issuers to file financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB. At any time in the future, as a foreign private issuer, we may decide to prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The application by us of different accounting standards, a change in the rules of IFRS as issued by the IASB, or in the SEC\u2019s acceptance of such rules, could have a significant effect on our reported financial results. Additionally, U.S. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. IFRS are subject to interpretation by the IASB. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nChanges in domestic and foreign laws, including tax law changes, could adversely affect the Company, its subsidiaries and its shareholders, and our effective tax rate may increase whether we effect the Conversion or not.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, in both or either of the U.S. or Cayman Islands, could adversely affect the tax consequences of the Conversion to an exempted company in Cayman Islands and the shareholders and/or our effective tax rates (whether associated with the Conversion or otherwise). While the Conversion is not anticipated to have any material impact on our effective tax rate, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate, and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material.\nThe enforcement of civil liabilities against the Company may be more difficult.\nAfter the Conversion, all of our executive officers and directors will continue to reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may be more difficult to serve legal process within the United States upon any of these persons and it may also be difficult to enforce, both in and outside of the United States, judgments you may obtain in the U.S. courts against these persons in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. Because we will be a Cayman Islands corporation, investors could also experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against the Company in U.S. courts than would currently be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against the Company. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against the Company in Cayman Islands courts than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nThe market for our shares after the Conversion may differ from the market for our shares before the Conversion.\nAlthough it is anticipated that our ordinary shares after the Conversion will continue to be listing on Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCCNC,\u201d as a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, the shares may appeal to different institutional investors, or impact the level of investment by current investors who may prefer or be required by internal guidelines to invest in companies that are incorporated in the United States. Accordingly, the reorganization may impact our institutional investor base, or the level of their respective investments in our securities, and may result in a change in the market prices, trading volume and volatility of the shares before and after the Conversion.\nWe expect to incur transaction costs and adverse financial consequences in the year of completion of the Conversion.\nWe expect a total of approximately $30,000 in transaction costs in connection with the Conversion, which have been and will continue to be expensed as incurred. The substantial majority of these costs will be incurred regardless of whether the Conversion is completed and prior to your vote on the proposal. We expect to incur costs and expenses, including professional fees, to comply with the Cayman Islands corporate and other laws. In addition, we expect to incur attorneys\u2019 fees, accountants\u2019 fees, filing fees, mailing expenses, proxy solicitation fees and financial printing expenses in connection with the Conversion, even if the Conversion is not approved or completed.\nThe Conversion also may negatively affect us by diverting attention of our management and employees from our operating business during the period of implementation and by increasing other administrative costs and expenses.\nOur Board of Directors may choose to defer or abandon the Conversion.\nCompletion of the Conversion may be deferred or abandoned, at any time, by action of our Board of Directors. While we currently expect the Conversion to take place promptly after certain regulatory requirements and approvals are met and obtained, our Board of Directors may defer or abandon the Conversion because of, among other reasons, changes in existing or proposed laws, our determination that the Conversion would involve tax or other risks that outweigh their benefits, our determination that the level of expected benefits associated with the Conversion would otherwise be reduced, a dispute with the taxation authorities over the Conversion (or certain aspects thereof), an unexpected increase in the cost to complete the Conversion or any other determination by our Board of Directors that the Conversion would not be in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders or that the Conversion would have material adverse consequences to the Company or its stockholders.", "PERMNO": 15664, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "CCNC"}
