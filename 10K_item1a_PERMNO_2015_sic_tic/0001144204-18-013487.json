RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Our business, financial condition or results of operations and trading price or value of our securities could be materially adversely affected by these risks if any of them actually occur. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face as described below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. There is no assurance that we will ever achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $1,510,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of\u2009 $26,432,000. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities and, to a limited extent, bank financing and issuance of promissory notes. In the current economic environment, financing for technology and medical device companies has become increasingly difficult to obtain. Additional financing may not be available in the amount that we need or on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of us by our stockholders would be diluted. In addition, in order to raise additional funds we may have to issue equity or debt securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing securities. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and marketing of our vascular testing products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph.\nAs noted above, we have incurred recurring losses since inception. Our limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded primarily through sales of our equity securities and, to a limited extent, debt financing and revenues from leasing our QuantaFlo\u2122 product. As of December 31, 2017, we had negative working capital of\u2009 $2,257,000, cash of\u2009 $1,457,000, stockholders\u2019 deficit of\u2009 $2,583,000 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $26,432,000. As our revenues grow, our operating expenses will continue to grow and, as a result, we will need to continue to generate revenues in excess of our expenses to remain profitable. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate additional revenues. We can give no assurances that additional capital that we are able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet our needs. The foregoing conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accountant\u2019s report for year ended December 31, 2017 includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities or raise additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.\nIf we do not successfully implement our business strategy, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy was formed based on assumptions about the PAD market and healthcare reform that might prove wrong. We believe that various demographics and industry-specific trends, including the aging of the general population, growth of capitated payment programs, numbers of undiagnosed patients with PAD and the importance of codifying vascular disease will help drive growth in the PAD market and our risk assessment business. However, these demographics and trends, and our assumptions about them,\nare uncertain. Actual demand for our products and service offerings could differ materially from projected demand if our assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect or do not materialize, or if alternatives to our products or other risk assessment service providers gain widespread acceptance.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. To implement our business strategy, we need to (among other things) find new applications for and improve our products and service offerings and educate healthcare providers and plans about the clinical and cost benefits of our products, all of which we believe could increase acceptance of our products by physicians. In addition, we are seeking to increase our sales and, in order to do so, will need to expand our direct and distributor sales forces in existing and new territories, all of which could result in our becoming subject to additional or different regulatory requirements, with which we may not be able to comply. Moreover, even if we successfully implement our business strategy, our operating results may not improve or may decline. We may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt different strategies due to business or competitive factors not currently foreseen, such as new medical technologies that would make our products obsolete. Any delay or failure to implement our business strategy may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently actively market only one FDA-cleared product, a vascular testing product, which we also incorporate into our wellness testing service; vascular testing may not achieve broad market acceptance or be commercially successful.\nWe currently actively market only one product, QuantaFlo\u2122 and expect that revenues from our vascular testing product will account for the vast majority of our revenues for at least the next several years. Our vascular testing product may not gain broad market acceptance unless we continue to convince physicians and plans of its benefits. Moreover, even if physicians understand the benefits of vascular testing, they still may elect not to use our product for a variety of reasons, such as the familiarity of the physician with other devices and approaches. We may not be successful in gaining market acceptance of a technique measuring comparative blood flows using our proprietary algorithm to indicate flow obstruction as opposed to existing techniques that measure comparative blood pressures using well-accepted criteria to indicate flow obstruction, or imaging techniques that visualize anatomy of the arteries. Physicians may also object to renting an examining tool with on-going monthly payments rather than making a one-time capital purchase, or be reluctant to pay monthly fees for tools in the examining room when they have many such tools, such as thermometer and stethoscope, that only required one-time minimal purchases.\nIf physicians do not perceive our vascular testing product as an attractive alternative to other products, procedures and techniques, we will not achieve significant market penetration or be able to generate significant revenues. To the extent that our product is not commercially successful or is withdrawn from the market for any reason, our revenues will be adversely impacted, and our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nPhysicians may not widely adopt our products unless they determine, based on experience, long-term clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of our products provides a safe and effective alternative to other existing ABI devices.\nWe believe that physicians will not widely adopt our vascular testing product or our other products in development unless they determine, based on experience, long-term clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of such product provides a safe and effective alternative to other existing ABI devices.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that the data collected from our past, current and any future clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate that our products are an attractive alternative to other ABI devices or procedures. If we fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy that is at least comparable to other ABI devices that are available on the market, our ability to successfully market our products will be significantly limited. Even if the data collected from clinical studies or clinical experience indicate positive results, each physician\u2019s actual experience with our products will vary. We also believe that published peer-reviewed journal articles and recommendations and support by influential physicians regarding our vascular testing product and our other products in development will be important for market acceptance and adoption, and\nwe cannot assure you that we will receive these recommendations and support, or that supportive articles will be published. Accordingly, there is a risk that our products may not be adopted by many physicians, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf healthcare providers are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement either for procedures performed using our product or patient care incorporating the use of our product, it is unlikely that our product will gain widespread acceptance.\nMaintaining and growing revenues from our products and service offerings depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Healthcare providers that use medical devices such as our vascular testing product to test their patients generally rely on third-party payors to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices, or to compensate them for their patient care services. The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement for the procedures or patient care performed with our vascular testing product by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our vascular testing product and any future products. During the past several years, third-party payors have undertaken cost-containment initiatives including different payment methods, monitoring healthcare expenditures, and anti-fraud initiatives. We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels. Further, many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS, which administers the Medicare program, as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. Future action by CMS or other government agencies may diminish payments to physicians, outpatient centers and/or hospitals. Those private payors that do not follow the Medicare guidelines may adopt different coverage and reimbursement policies for procedures or patient care performed with our vascular testing product. For some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for the procedures or patient care performed with our vascular testing product if any payment is made at all. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicare continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. Furthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the procedures or patient care performed with our product will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level.\nOur vascular testing product is generally but not specifically approved for reimbursement under any third-party payor codes; if third-party payors refuse to reimburse our customers for their use of our product, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur vascular testing product is licensed by healthcare providers. They may bill various third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs for procedures in which our vascular testing product is used. Reimbursement is a significant factor considered by healthcare providers in determining whether to license medical devices or systems such as our vascular testing product. We cannot control whether or not providers who use our vascular testing product will seek reimbursement. Therefore, our ability to successfully commercialize our vascular testing product could depend on the adequacy of coverage and reimbursement from these third-party payors.\nCurrently, our vascular testing product is generally but not specifically approved for any particular reimbursement code. Although most of our customers report being covered and reimbursed by third-party payors consistently for procedures using a variety of different reimbursement codes, there is a risk that third-party payors may disagree with the reimbursement under a particular code. In addition, some potential customers have deferred renting our product given the uncertainty regarding reimbursement. We do not track denial of requests for reimbursement made by the users of our product. It is our belief that such denials have occurred and might occur in the future with more or less frequency. Even if our product and procedures are often currently covered and reimbursed by third-party payors and Medicare, problems for customers to receive reimbursement or adverse changes in payors\u2019 coverage and reimbursement policies\nthat affect our product could harm our ability to market our vascular testing product. Obtaining approval for a particular reimbursement code is time consuming and can be costly. Accordingly, at this time, and given the way we intend our vascular testing product to be used, we do not intend to pursue formal approval for our vascular testing product for any particular code.\nMoreover, we are unable to predict what changes will be made to the reimbursement methodologies used by third-party payors. We cannot be certain that under current and future payment systems, in which healthcare providers may be reimbursed a set amount based on the type of procedure performed, such as those utilized by Medicare and in many privately managed care systems, the cost of our product will be justified and incorporated into the overall cost of the procedure.\nWe rely on a small number of employees in our direct sales force and face challenges and risk in managing and maintaining our distribution network and the parties who make up that network.\nWe face significant challenges and risks in managing our distribution network and retaining the parties who make up that network. We had only three dedicated direct sales employees at December 31, 2017. If any of our sales or marketing force were to resign, or if our co-exclusive distributor were to cease to do business with us, our sales could be adversely affected. Our co-exclusive distributor accounted for less than 20% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. If our co-exclusive distributor were to cease to distribute our product, it would slow down our efforts to gain widespread market acceptance of our vascular testing product. Although we have a good relationship with our co-exclusive distributor and have no reason to believe that our current contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of December 2019 or that our co-exclusive distributor will terminate our arrangement prior to expiration (which it is permitted to do upon 90 days\u2019 notice under our contract), we may need to seek out alternatives, such as increasing our direct sales and marketing force or contracting with external independent sales representatives or enter another distributor relationship. There is no guarantee that we would be successful in our efforts to find independent sales representatives or another large distributor, or that we would be able to negotiate contract terms favorable to us. Failure to hire or retain qualified direct sales and marketing personnel or independent distributors would prevent us from expanding our business and generating revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nTo adequately commercialize our products, we may need to increase our sales and marketing network, which will require us to hire, train, retain and supervise employees and other independent contractors.\nWe are currently exploring other sales models to generate revenues from our products in addition to the leasing model. As we increase our marketing efforts to pursue these new strategies, and expand our efforts to target insurance plans that serve Medicare Advantage members, we may need to increase our sales and marketing network. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled direct sales representatives, independent sales representatives or distributors with significant technical knowledge about our product, in addition to coordinating networks of contract medical assistants and other personnel to staff health and wellness fairs and physicians\u2019 offices in fee-for-service models. New hires and independent contractors require training, supervision and take time to achieve full productivity. If we fail to train and supervise new hires adequately, or if we experience high turnover in our sales force or trained professionals in the future, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or increase our sales. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our vascular testing product or our other products and service offerings in development, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not require our customers to enter into long-term licenses or maintenance contracts for our products or services and may therefore lose customers on short notice.\nOur business is primarily based on a leasing model rather than an outright sale of our products. Our pricing is based on data collected on use rates and third-party payment rates to physicians and facilities for the use of our product. We require no down payment, long-term commitment or maintenance contract or fees from our customers and replace damaged products free of charge in the service model. If we lose current customers on short notice, we may not be able to find new customers to replace them with in a timely manner and that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our business model of replacing damaged products free of charge may prove to be costly and affect the profitability of our service model.\nWe are exposed to risk as a significant portion of our revenues and our accounts receivables are with a limited number of customers.\nOne customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and our accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers accounted for 55.0% and 11.1% of our revenues, and as of December 31, 2017, two customers accounted for 56.6% and 23.9% of our accounts receivable, respectively. If our largest customers were to cease using or stop payment for our vascular testing devices, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and/or our accounts receivable. This concentration of revenues and accounts receivable among a limited number of customers represents a significant risk.\nWe rely heavily upon the talents of our Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whom could severely damage our business.\nOur performance depends to a large extent on a small number of key scientific, technical, managerial and marketing personnel. In particular, we believe our success is highly dependent upon the services and reputation of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Douglas Murphy-Chutorian. We do not have key man insurance for Dr. Murphy-Chutorian. The loss of Dr. Murphy-Chutorian\u2019s services could still severely damage our business prospects, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a small number of independent suppliers and facilities for the manufacturing of our vascular testing product. Any delay or disruption in the supply of the product or facility may negatively impact our operations.\nWe manufacture our vascular testing product through a small number of independent contractors. The loss or disruption of our relationships with outside vendors could subject us to substantial delays in the delivery of our product to customers. Significant delays in the delivery of our product could result in possible cancellation of orders and the loss of customers. Although we expect our vendors to comply with our contract terms, we do not have control over our vendors. Our inability to provide a product that meets delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we manufacture our vascular testing product in a limited number of facilities. If an event occurred that resulted in material damage to these manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing contractors lacked sufficient labor to fully operate their facilities, we may be unable to transfer the manufacture of our vascular testing product to another facility or location in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. This potential inability to transfer production could occur for a number of reasons, including but not limited to a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility, or the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies. Even if there are many qualified contract manufacturers available around the country and our product is relatively easy to manufacture, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we operate in an industry with significant product liability risk, and we may not be sufficiently insured against this risk, we may be subject to substantial claims against our product or services that we may provide.\nThe development, manufacture and sale, lease or use of products or provision of services in a medical setting entails significant risks of product liability or other negligence or malpractice claims. Although we maintain insurance to cover us in the event of liability claims, and as of the date of this this annual report on Form 10-K, no such claims have been asserted or threatened against us, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all possible future liabilities regarding our product, or from performing tests with our product or other non-proprietary products. Accordingly, we may not be adequately protected from any liabilities, including any adverse judgments or settlements, we might incur in connection with the development, clinical testing, manufacture and sale, lease or use of our products or the provision of services. A successful product liability claim or negligence or medical malpractice claim or series of claims brought against us that result in an adverse judgment against or settlement by us in excess of any insurance\ncoverage could seriously harm our financial condition or reputation. Moreover, even if no judgments, fines, damages or liabilities are imposed on us, our reputation could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, product liability and other malpractice insurance is expensive and may not always be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal or stop shipment of our product due to product defects or product enhancements and modifications, which would significantly increase our costs.\nThe manufacturing and marketing of our vascular testing product and any future products that we may develop involves an inherent risk that our products may prove to be defective. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or stop shipment, or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall of our vascular testing product or one of our future products, or a similar product manufactured by another manufacturer, could impair sales of the products we market as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or as a result of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety. Further any product recall, voluntary market withdrawal or shipment stoppage of our product could significantly increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nOur growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and on our operational and financial resources and systems. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause us to over-invest or under-invest, and result in losses or weaknesses. Additionally, our anticipated growth will increase the demands placed on our supplier, resulting in an increased need for us to carefully monitor for quality assurance. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nFluctuations in insurance cost and availability could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.\nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including product liability insurance, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if any of our current insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers. If we operate our business without insurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us that would have otherwise been covered by insurance, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to remain profitable.\nWe intend to increase our operating expenses substantially as we add sales and technical support representatives to increase our geographic coverage, increase our marketing capabilities, pursue research and new product and service offering development and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. We only recently had our first profitable quarter. We will need to generate significant sales to maintain profitability and we might not be able to do so. Even if we do generate significant sales, we might not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our sales grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will likely be adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on the successful improvements and software updates to our vascular testing product on a cost-effective basis.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to influence, anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs and the technologies relating to the care and treatment of vascular problems. We can provide no assurances that our vascular testing product will achieve significant commercial success and that it will gain meaningful market share. We may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences or needs, or may identify them later than competitors do. In addition, difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay or prohibit\nimprovements to our vascular testing product or our other products in development. Further, we may not be able to develop improvements and software updates to our vascular testing product at a cost that allows us to meet our goals for profitability. Service costs relating to our product may be greater than anticipated, rentals may be returned prior to the end of the license term, and we may be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our vascular testing product.\nFailure to successfully introduce improve or update our products on a cost-effective basis, or delays in customer decisions related to the evaluation of our products could cause us to lose market acceptance and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and there is a substantial risk our products or service offerings could become obsolete or uncompetitive.\nThe market for medical systems, equipment and other devices and services is highly competitive. We compete with many medical service companies in the United States and internationally in connection with our vascular testing product and products under development. We face competition from numerous companies in the diagnostic area, as well as competition from academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Most of our current and potential competitors have, and will continue to have, substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to successfully commercialize our vascular testing product or any other future products, if and when they are approved for sale or license, or service offerings that we may develop. Our future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative technologies or products or service offerings that are more effective, easier to use or more economical than what we or any potential licensee develop. If our technologies or products or service offerings become obsolete or uncompetitive, our related revenues would decrease. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of our business strategies is developing additional products and service offerings that allow healthcare providers to deliver cost-effective wellness and receive increased compensation for their services. The development of new products and service offerings involves time and expense and we may never realize the benefits of this investment.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to develop additional products and service offerings that allow healthcare providers to deliver cost-effective wellness and receive increased compensation for their services. Such product and service offering development may require substantial investments and we may commit significant resources and time before knowing whether our efforts will translate into profits for our company. It is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that we will not be able to develop new products or service offerings, or if developed that we will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for commercialization. Even if we receive necessary regulatory approvals, there is no guarantee that such approved products or any new service offerings will achieve market acceptance and we may never realize the benefits of any investment in this strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur business is subject to many laws and government regulations governing the manufacture and sale of medical devices, including the FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process, and laws and regulations governing patient data and information, among others.\nOur vascular testing product and any future medical devices that we may develop or services that we may offer are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the federal government, including by the FDA. The FDA regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device\u2019s design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, adverse event reporting, sale, promotion, distribution and shipping. We must report to the FDA when evidence suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If such adverse event occurred, we could incur substantial expense and harm to our reputation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a new medical device can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either pre-market approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA, unless an exemption exists. The same rule applies when a manufacturer plans to market a medical device for a new use. The process can be costly and time-consuming. The FDA is expected to respond to a section 510(k) notification in 90 days, but often takes much longer. The pre-market approval process usually takes six months to three years, but may take longer. We cannot assure that any new medical devices or new uses or modifications for our vascular testing product that we develop will be cleared or approved in a timely or cost-effective manner, if cleared or approved at all. Even if such clearances or approvals are received, they may not be for all indications. Because medical devices may only be marketed for cleared or approved indications, this could significantly limit the market for that product and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur vascular testing product was initially cleared through the 510(k) clearance process in February 2010, and in March 2015 we received FDA clearance of the next generation version, QuantaFlo\u2122. However, any further modification to a cleared 510(k) device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, will require a new clearance process. The FDA requires device manufacturers to make their own determination regarding whether a modification requires a new clearance; however, the FDA can review and invalidate a manufacturer\u2019s decision not to file for a new clearance. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will agree with our decisions not to seek clearances for particular device modifications or that we will be successful in obtaining 510(k) clearances for modifications. Any such additional clearance processes with the FDA could delay our ability to market a modified product and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nMoreover, as we explore other opportunities to generate revenues, which include performing risk assessment testing for physicians or insurance plans on their patient pools, we are subject to additional laws and regulations regarding the provision of such services. Although we intend to subcontract for qualified and licensed professionals to use our vascular testing product, among others, to provide risk assessment services to our customers\u2019 patients, the provision of such services is subject to a number of laws and regulations, including with respect to patient data and other information.\nThe FDA may change its policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, in particular relating to the 510(k) clearance process.\nThe FDA may change its policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay pre-market approval or 510(k) clearance of a device, or could impact our ability to market our currently cleared device. Future reforms could require us to file new 510(k) clearances and could increase the total number of 510(k) clearance to be filed. We cannot predict what effect these reforms will have on our ability to obtain 510(k) clearances in a timely manner. We also cannot predict the nature of other regulatory reforms and their resulting effects on our business.\nOur business is subject to unannounced inspections by FDA to determine our compliance with FDA requirements.\nFDA inspections can result in inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form-483, warning letters or other forms of more significant enforcement action. More specifically, if FDA concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that our vascular testing product or any future medical device we develop is ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to notify health professionals and others that our devices present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to public health;\n\u2022\norder us to recall, repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that we manufactured or distributed;\n\u2022\ndetain, seize or ban adulterated or misbranded medical devices;\n\u2022\nrefuse to provide us with documents necessary to export our product;\n\u2022\nrefuse requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products or new intended uses;\n\u2022\nwithdraw 510(k) clearances that are already granted;\n\u2022\nimpose operating restrictions, including requiring a partial or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nenjoin or restrain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices; and/or\n\u2022\nassess criminal or civil penalties against our officers, employees or us.\nIf the FDA concludes that we failed to comply with any regulatory requirement during an inspection, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We could incur substantial expense and harm to our reputation, and our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could be adversely affected.\nAlthough part of our business strategy is based on new payment provisions enacted under the current government healthcare reform, we also face significant uncertainty in the industry regarding the implementation, transformation or repeal and replacement of the Health Care Reform Law.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Health Care Reform Law. The Health Care Reform Law brought a new way of doing business for providers and health insurance plans, shifting the focus from fee for service programs to capitated programs that pay a monthly fee per patient. The Health Care Reform law also provided for higher risk factor adjustment payments for sicker patients who have conditions that are codified, as well as economic benefits for achieving certain quality of care measurements.\nSome of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Health Care Reform Law. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Health Care Reform Law have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Care Reform Law on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Health Care Reform Law-mandated fees.\nWe believe that the Health Care Reform Law measures are mainly positive for our business given the ability of our vascular testing product to measure blood flow in an in-office setting, which can assist doctors and other providers to suspect PAD and other vascular diseases. However, we cannot predict what changes will now be made, and if these features will be repealed. If changes are made to the Health Care Reform Law, or it is repealed altogether without a comparable replacement, such that there are no incentives for identifying sicker patients, it would negatively affect our business prospects and strategy, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Health Care Reform Law imposes a 2.3% excise tax on the sale, lease, rental or use of any taxable human medical device after December 31, 2012, subject to certain exclusions, by the manufacturer, producer or importer of such device. Generally, the lease of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer will be treated as a sale for purposes of the medical device excise tax, and the medical device excise tax will be imposed on the portion of the lease payment that relates to the use of the taxable medical device (subject to limitation in certain circumstances). This new and significant tax burden could have a negative impact on our results of our operations. Although this tax was suspended as of January 1, 2016 for a two-year period ending December 31, 2017, and further suspended through December 31, 2019, in accordance with the continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018, recently signed by President Trump, the potential tax burden could still be significant for 2018 and beyond, if not repealed altogether. Further, the Health Care Reform Law encourages hospitals and physicians to work\ncollaboratively through shared savings programs, such as accountable care organizations, as well as other bundled payment initiatives, which may ultimately result in the reduction of medical device acquisitions and the consolidation of medical device suppliers used by hospitals. Changes to or repeal of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our financial results and business.\nThe applicable healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, along with the increased enforcement environment, may lead to an enforcement action targeting us, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, state anti-kickback statutes, the Federal False Claims Act, and state false claims acts. Additionally, to the extent we maintain financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, we may be subject to Federal and state physician payment sunshine laws and regulations, which require us to track and disclose these financial relationships. These and other laws regulate interactions amongst health care entities and with sources of referrals of business, among other things. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that imposes substantial penalties on persons or entities that offer, solicit, pay or receive payments in return for referrals, recommendations, purchases or orders of items or services that are reimbursable by Federal healthcare programs. The Federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that submits or causes to be submitted a claim to the Federal government that he or she knows (or should know) is false. The Health Care Reform Law further provides that a claim submitted for items or services, the provision of which resulted from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, is \u201cfalse\u201d under the Federal False Claims Act and certain other false claims statutes.\nWe may be subject to liability under these laws and may also be subject to liability for any future conduct that is deemed by the government or the courts to violate these laws, including criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations.\nAdditionally, over the past ten years, partially as the result of the passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and of the Health Care Reform Law, the government has pursued an increasing number of enforcement actions. This increased enforcement environment may increase scrutiny of us, directly or indirectly, and could increase the likelihood of an enforcement action targeting us. We have entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., as well as purchase agreements with a number of our customers, and intend to start offering risk assessment services to our customers. These customers include parties that bill Federal healthcare programs for use of our product, all of whom may be subject to government scrutiny. Finally, to the extent that any of the agreements are breached or terminated, our business may experience a decrease in revenues. In addition, to the extent that our customers, many of whom are providers, may be affected by this increased enforcement environment, our business could correspondingly be affected. It is possible that a review of our business practices or those of our customers by courts or government authorities could result in a determination with an adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the effect of possible future enforcement actions on our business.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, there could be changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation, or the effects of a change in tax policy in the United States, could have a material effect on our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nThe recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses, or NOLs, to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of NOL carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal NOL carryforwards of\u2009 $16.9 million. These NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from our first sale of securities pursuant to an effective registration statement. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this annual report on Form 10-K. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to other companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has been and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs, and our management has been and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. Moreover, after we are no longer an emerging growth company, and in particular if we are no longer a smaller reporting company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses to address compliance and corporate governance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Although we are currently both an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company, and thus not yet required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm, our management and other personnel will nevertheless need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, the currently applicable rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. We will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nWe currently have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remedy these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future, or if our former material weaknesses recur, it could have an adverse effect on our company.\nIn connection with their evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2017, our management identified certain continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Namely, a lack of controls to identify and analyze related party transactions and a lack of technical accounting competence. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to our management\u2019s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. Had our independent registered public accounting firm performed such an attestation of on our management\u2019s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, additional material weaknesses may have been identified by management or our independent registered public accounting firm.\nAlthough we implemented measures in 2016 and 2017 to remedy some of our former material weaknesses, they were not sufficient to eliminate all material weaknesses. Accordingly, we are continuing to evaluate and implement additional measures to address these continuing material weaknesses. Further, we cannot assure you that we have identified all or that we will not in the future have additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we have additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, it could have an adverse effect on our company.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success largely depends on our ability to obtain and protect the proprietary information on which we base our product.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through the patent process, as well as our ability to license from others patents and patent applications necessary to develop our product. If our patent or any future patents are successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our right or ability to manufacture our product was to be limited, our ability to continue to manufacture and market our product could be adversely affected. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. The other parties to these agreements may breach these provisions, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have been issued, or have rights to, one U.S. patent. The patent we hold may be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may otherwise be unable to rely on this patent. These risks are also present for the process we use for manufacturing our product. In addition, our competitors, many of whom have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our product, either in the United States or in international markets. The medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may institute, become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our product and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. Any litigation or interference proceedings involving us may require us to incur substantial legal and other fees and expenses and may require some of our employees to devote all or a substantial portion of their time to the proceedings.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our vascular testing product or any future products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to commercialize our own technology or products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. A license to such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that we and our employees and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or that these employees or independent contractors have used or disclosed intellectual property in violation of the rights of others. These claims may cover a range of matters, such as challenges to our trademarks, as\nwell as claims that our employees or independent contractors are using trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee\u2019s former employer or independent contractors. Although we do not expect the resolution of the proceeding to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, litigation to defend ourselves against claims can be both costly and time consuming, and divert management\u2019s attention away from growing our business.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and independent contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also generally enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party infringed a patent or illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and significant stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and significant stockholders beneficially own in the aggregate shares representing approximately 63.9% of our common stock as of December 31, 2017. If these stockholders\nchoose to act together, they are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, can control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership control may:\n\u2022\ndelay, defer or prevent a change in control;\n\u2022\nentrench our management and the board of directors; or\n\u2022\nimpede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nallow for a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholders proposal that can be acted on at stockholder meeting and nominations to our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and is trading on the over-the-counter markets, which may negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market suspended trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market in August 2016, and in November 2016, our common stock was delisted. Our common stock is currently trading on the over-the-counter markets, which could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. Stocks traded on the over-the-counter market generally have limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotation, as compared to securities listed on a national securities exchange. Consequently, you may not be able to liquidate your investment in the event of an emergency or for any other reason.\nSome significant material adverse consequences of trading on the over-the-counter markets may include:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u2022\na reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for us;\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for our stockholders;\n\u2022\npotential loss of confidence by partners and employees; and\n\u2022\nloss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. This volatility is even more prevalent in the over-the-counter markets. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the medical device sector;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nThere is no assurance of an established public trading market.\nA regular market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future. The OTCQB is an inter-dealer, over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than the Nasdaq Capital Market. Quotes for stocks included on the OTCQB are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers. As such, investors and potential investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate stock price quotations, and holders of our common stock may be unable to resell their securities at or near their original offering price or at any price. Market prices for our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a future offering;\n\u2022\nchange in interest rates;\n\u2022\ncompetitive development, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchange in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of our company and medical device industry generally; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and other national conditions.\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a future offering;\n\u2022\nchange in interest rates;\nWe may not be able to achieve secondary trading of our common stock in certain states because our common stock is not nationally traded.\nBecause our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange, our common stock is subject to the securities laws of the various states and jurisdictions of the United States in addition to federal securities law. Such regulations cover any primary offering we might attempt and all secondary trading by our stockholders. If we fail to take appropriate steps to register our common stock or qualify for exemptions for our common stock in certain states or jurisdiction of the United States, the investors in those jurisdictions where we have not taken such steps may not be allowed to purchase our common stock and those who presently hold our common stock may not be able to resell their shares without substantial effort and expense. These restrictions and potential costs could be significant burdens on our stockholders.\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB, which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the OTCQB, such as we, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must be current in their reports under Section 13 in order to maintain price quotation privileges. If we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB. As a result, the market liquidity of our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of our stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to stockholders.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic acquisition opportunities, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in such an offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe price per share at which we sell or issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price at which you purchased your shares.", "PERMNO": 14469, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SMLR"}
