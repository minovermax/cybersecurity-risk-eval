{"cik": "1615219", "company": "Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this report, the words \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those risks discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this report, and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and Salarius\u2019 financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones faced by Salarius. If any of the risks actually occur, Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Salarius expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Salarius\u2019 expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nRisks Related to the Development of Salarius\u2019 Product Candidates\nThe approach we are taking to discover and develop novel oncology therapeutics using epigenetic enzymes to moderate transcription factors and thereby control abnormal protein expression is unproven and may never lead to marketable products.\nThe scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop its current product candidates are relatively recent. To date, neither we nor any other company has received regulatory approval to market therapeutics using epigenetic enzymes. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. The Successful development of therapeutic products will require solving a number of issues. In addition, any product candidates that we develop may not demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory and pre-clinical trials, and they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or even harmful ways. For instance, our clinical and pre-clinical data to date is not validated and we have no way of knowing if after validation our clinical trial data will be complete and consistent. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon this technological approach, we may not become profitable and the value of its capital stock may decline.\nFurther, our focus on epigenetic enzyme technology for developing product candidates as opposed to multiple, more proven technologies for drug development increases the risk associated with its business. If we are not successful in developing an approved product using its technology, we may not be able to identify and successfully implement an alternative product development strategy. In addition, work by other companies pursuing similar technologies may encounter setbacks and difficulties that regulators and investors may attribute to our product candidates, whether appropriate or not.\nClinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nClinical development is expensive, time consuming and involves significant risk. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n\u2022the inability to generate satisfactory pre-clinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data or diagnostics to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with clinical research organizations, (\u201cCROs\u201d), and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays in obtaining required IRB approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022failure to permit the conduct of a clinical trial by regulatory authorities, after review of an investigational new drug or equivalent foreign application or amendment;\n\u2022delays in recruiting qualified patients in its clinical trials;\n\u2022failure by clinical sites or CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u2022failure by Salarius clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to perform in accordance with the good clinical practices requirements of the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022patients dropping out of our clinical trials;\n\u2022adverse events or tolerability or animal toxicology issues significant enough for the FDA or other regulatory agencies to put any or all clinical trials on hold;\n\u2022occurrence of adverse events associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs in other ongoing or planned indications for a product candidate; and\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party manufacturers and the time for manufacture of sufficient quantities of its product candidates for use in clinical trials.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for its product candidates could result in additional costs or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional pre-clinical trials or the results obtained from such new formulation may not be consistent with previous results obtained. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nSalarius\u2019 therapeutic product candidates are based on a relatively novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the timing and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval, if at all.\nSalarius has concentrated its research and development efforts to date on a limited number of product candidates based on its epigenetic enzyme therapeutic platform and identifying its initial targeted disease indications. Salarius\u2019 future success depends on its successful development of viable product candidates. Currently, only one of its product candidates Seclidemstat, a reversible LSD1 inhibitor, is in Phase 1 clinical development, and the remainder of its product candidates are in pre-clinical development. There can be no assurance that Salarius will not experience problems or delays in developing its product candidates and that such problems or delays will not cause unanticipated costs, or that any such development problems can be solved.\nThe clinical trial and manufacturing requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities, and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate, vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the product candidate. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as epigenetic enzyme therapeutics can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates. It is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for Salarius\u2019 product candidates in either the United States or the European Union or how long it will take to commercialize its product candidates, even if approved for marketing. Approvals by the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA, and vice versa, may require for approval and different or additional pre-clinical trials or clinical trials may\nbe required to support regulatory approval in each respective jurisdiction. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product candidate to market could decrease Salarius\u2019 ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed.\nSalarius\u2019 product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial viability of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by its product candidates could cause Salarius or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or terminate clinical trials or even if approved, result in a restrictive label or delay regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities.\nIn addition, to date Salarius\u2019 product candidates have been studied in only a very limited number of patients. Salarius may experience a high rates or severity of adverse events and comparable or high rates of discontinuation in testing in its future clinical trials. There is no guarantee that severe side effects will not be identified through ongoing clinical trials of Salarius\u2019 product candidates for current and other indications. Undesirable side effects and negative results for other indications may negatively impact the development and potential for approval of Salarius\u2019 product candidates for their proposed indications. Specifically, as a result of concerns regarding the potential teratogenic and abortifacient effects of SP-2577, pregnant women were excluded from the conducted studies.\nAdditionally, even if one or more of its product candidates receives marketing approval, and Salarius or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such products;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022Salarius may be required to create a REMS plan, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers, and/or other elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022Salarius could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022its reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent Salarius from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of a product candidate, even if approved, and could significantly harm or cause the complete failure of its business, results of operations, and prospects.\nSalarius\u2019 product development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who take its product candidates may experience. The number of subjects exposed to Seclidemstat or its other product candidates and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events, or chance findings, that may only be detected once the product is administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.\nClinical trials by their nature use a sample of the potential patient population. However, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, Salarius cannot be fully assured that rare and severe side effects of Seclidemstat or its other product candidates will be uncovered. Such rare and severe side effects may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the drug. If such safety problems occur or are identified after Seclidemstat or another product candidate reaches the market, the FDA may require that Salarius amend the labeling of the product or recall the product, or may even withdraw approval for the product.\nSome of Salarius\u2019 product candidates may produce results in pre-clinical or clinical settings for indications other than those for which Salarius contemplates conducting development and seeking FDA approval, and Salarius cannot give any assurance that it will generate data for any of its product candidates sufficient to receive regulatory approval in its planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized.\nSalarius currently has one product candidate in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for advanced solid tumors - Seclidemstat. This is only one of the multiple indications for which Salarius plans to develop this product candidate. There can be no assurance that the data that Salarius develops for its product candidates in its planned indications will be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval.\nIn addition, none of its product candidates have advanced into a pivotal clinical trial for Salarius\u2019 proposed indications and it may be years before any such clinical trial is initiated and completed, if at all. Salarius is not permitted to market or promote any of its product candidates before it receives regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and Salarius may never receive such regulatory approval for any of its product candidates. Salarius cannot be certain that any of its product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, its product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If Salarius does not receive regulatory approvals for its product candidates, Salarius may not be able to continue its operations.\nProduct development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier pre-clinical and clinical trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and generally takes many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of pre-clinical trials and early clinical trials of Salarius\u2019 product candidates may not be predictive of the results of larger, later-stage controlled clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical trials may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical trials. Salarius\u2019 clinical trials to date have been conducted on a small number of patients in limited numbers of clinical sites for a limited number of indications. Salarius will have to conduct larger, well-controlled trials in its proposed indications to verify the results obtained to date and to support any regulatory submissions for further clinical development. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles despite promising results in earlier, smaller clinical trials. Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Salarius does not know whether any Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, or other clinical trials Salarius may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety with respect to the proposed indication for use sufficient to receive regulatory approval or market its drug candidates.\nSalarius may use its financial and human resources to pursue a particular research and/or development program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause Salarius has limited financial and human resources, it may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with some programs or product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Salarius\u2019 resource allocation decisions may cause it to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or more profitable market opportunities. Salarius\u2019 spending on current and future research and development programs and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. Salarius may also enter into additional strategic collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize some of its programs and potential product candidates in indications with potentially large commercial markets. If Salarius does not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, it may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaborations, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for Salarius to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or Salarius may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nSalarius may find it difficult to enroll patients in its clinical trials given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which its product candidates are being studied. Difficulty in enrolling patients is a common hurdle faced by early stage biotechnology companies and could, and often does, delay or prevent clinical trials of product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of Salarius\u2019 product candidates is essential to its success. The timing of Salarius\u2019 clinical trials depends in part on the rate at which Salarius can recruit patients to participate in clinical trials of its product candidates, and Salarius may experience delays in its clinical trials if Salarius encounters difficulties in enrollment, clinical enrollment is inherently difficult, and often time consuming.\nThe eligibility criteria of Salarius\u2019 planned clinical trials may further limit the available eligible trial participants as Salarius expects to require that patients have specific characteristics that Salarius can measure or meet the criteria to assure their conditions are appropriate for inclusion in its clinical trials. Salarius may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete its clinical trials in a timely manner because of the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials, and the willingness of physicians to participate in its planned clinical trials. If patients are unwilling to participate in Salarius\u2019 clinical trials for any reason, the timeline for conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of its product candidates may be delayed.\nIf Salarius experiences delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trials of its product candidates, the commercial prospects of its product candidates could be harmed, and its ability to generate product revenue from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing its clinical trials would likely increase its overall costs, impair product candidate development and jeopardize its ability to obtain regulatory approval relative to its current plans. Any of these occurrences may harm its business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nSalarius may face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against it, Salarius may incur substantial liability and costs which could be greater than its insurance coverage or overall resources. If the use or misuse of Salarius\u2019 product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to its product candidates, Salarius\u2019 regulatory approvals, if any, could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and Salarius could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. If Salarius is unable to obtain adequate insurance or is required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, its insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect its financial condition.\nThe use or misuse of Salarius\u2019 product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which Salarius may obtain marketing approval exposes Salarius to the risk of potential product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against Salarius by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with its product candidates and approved products, if any. There is a risk that Salarius\u2019 product candidates may induce adverse events. If Salarius cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, it could incur substantial liability and costs. Patients with the diseases targeted by Salarius\u2019 product candidates may already be in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant preexisting and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to Salarius\u2019 product candidates. Such events could subject Salarius to costly litigation, require it to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end its opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market its products, or require Salarius to suspend or abandon its commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which an adverse event is unrelated to Salarius\u2019 product candidates, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may delay Salarius\u2019 regulatory approval process or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals its product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough Salarius has product liability insurance, which covers its clinical trials in the United States, for up to $2.0 million per occurrence, up to an aggregate limit of $5.0 million, its insurance may be insufficient to reimburse it for any expenses or losses Salarius may suffer. Salarius will also likely be required to increase its product liability insurance coverage for the advanced clinical trials that it plans to initiate. If Salarius obtains marketing approval for any of its product candidates, it will need to expand its insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products. There is no way to know if Salarius will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if it requires it, in sufficient amounts to protect it against losses due to liability, on acceptable terms, or at all. Salarius may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, its insurance coverage. Where Salarius has provided indemnities in favor of third parties under its agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against Salarius alleging that one of its product candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Any product liability claim brought against Salarius, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or trial sites or limitations on approved indications;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize, or if commercialized, decreased demand for, its product candidates;\n\u2022if commercialized, product recalls, withdrawals of labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions or the need for product modification;\n\u2022initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022loss of revenues;\n\u2022substantial costs of litigation, including monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022liabilities that substantially exceed Salarius\u2019 product liability insurance, which Salarius would then be required to pay itself;\n\u2022an increase in Salarius\u2019 product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from Salarius\u2019 business; and\n\u2022damage to Salarius\u2019 reputation and the reputation of its products and its technology.\nProduct liability claims may subject Salarius to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Salarius\u2019 Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through equity financings and a grant from CPRIT. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $7,352,254 and $6,936,263 for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence.\nWe will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.\nWe have devoted substantially all our financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or grants. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative and competitive undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We expect losses to increase as we complete Phase 1 development and advance into Phase 2 development of our lead product candidates. It may be several years, if ever, before we complete pivotal clinical trials and have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We expect to invest significant funds into the research and development of our current product candidates to determine the potential to advance these product candidates to regulatory approval. We expect to be required to expend a significant amount of funds before we know if we have a clinically successful product candidate.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates may receive approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market\nacceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets. Even if we obtain adequate market share for our product candidates, because the potential markets in which our product candidates may ultimately receive regulatory approval could be very small, we may never become profitable despite obtaining such market share and acceptance of its products.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future and our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022continue the clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022continue efforts to discover new product candidates;\n\u2022undertake the manufacturing of our product candidates or increase volumes manufactured by third parties;\n\u2022advance our programs into larger, more expensive clinical trials;\n\u2022initiate additional pre-clinical, clinical, or other trials or studies for our product candidates;\n\u2022seek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and market for ourselves;\n\u2022seek to identify, assess, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates;\n\u2022make milestone, royalty or other payments under third-party license agreements;\n\u2022seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022seek to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u2022experience any delays or encounters issues with the development and potential for regulatory approval of our clinical candidates such as safety issues, clinical trial accrual delays, longer follow-up for planned studies, additional major studies, or supportive studies necessary to support marketing approval.\nFurther, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nSalarius has never generated any revenue from product sales and may never generate revenue or be profitable.\nSalarius has no products approved for commercialization and has never generated any revenue. Salarius\u2019 ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on its ability, alone or with strategic collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize one or more of its product candidates. Salarius does not anticipate generating revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Salarius\u2019 ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on its success in many areas, including but not limited to:\n\u2022completing research and development of its product candidates;\n\u2022obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for its product candidates;\n\u2022manufacturing product candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that are commercially feasible, meet regulatory requirements and Salarius\u2019 supply needs in sufficient quantities to meet market demand for its product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022marketing, launching and commercializing product candidates for which Salarius obtains regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u2022gaining market acceptance of its product candidates as treatment options;\n\u2022addressing any competing products;\n\u2022protecting and enforcing its intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how;\n\u2022negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which Salarius may enter;\n\u2022obtaining reimbursement or pricing for its product candidates that supports profitability; and\n\u2022attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that Salarius develops is approved for commercial sale, Salarius anticipates incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Portions of its current pipeline of product candidates have been in-licensed from third parties, which make the commercial sale of such in-licensed products potentially subject to additional royalty and milestone payments to such third parties. Salarius will also have to develop, contract for or acquire manufacturing capabilities to continue development and potential commercialization of its product candidates. Salarius will need to develop or procure its drug product in a commercially feasible manner in order to successfully commercialize any future approved product; if any. Additionally, if Salarius is not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, Salarius may never become profitable.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to Salarius\u2019 stockholders, restrict its operations or require Salarius to relinquish rights.\nSalarius received substantial funding during the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021 including a warrant inducement program ($3.6 million), At the Market offering ($6.3 million), warrant exercises ($1.5 million), CPRIT funding ($1.7 million) and a public offering of common stock ($23.0 million). Other than the CPRIT funding, these raises caused significant dilution to stockholders who owned Salarius shares prior to these capital raises. To the extent that Salarius raises additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other securities convertible into equity the ownership interest of Salarius\u2019 stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of Salarius\u2019 equity holders. Debt financing, if available at all, would likely involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting Salarius\u2019 ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, making additional product acquisitions, or declaring dividends. If Salarius raises additional funds through strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties, Salarius may have to relinquish valuable rights to its product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to Salarius. Salarius cannot be assured that it will be able to obtain additional funding when necessary to fund its entire portfolio of product candidates to meet its projected plans. If Salarius is unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, Salarius may be required to delay or discontinue one or more of its development programs or the commercialization of any product candidates or be unable to expand its operations or otherwise capitalize on potential business opportunities, which could materially harm Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSalarius has also historically received funds from state and federal government grants for research and development including CPRIT. The grants have been, and any future government grants and contracts Salarius may receive may be, subject to the risks and contingencies set forth below under the risk factor titled \u201cReliance on government funding for Salarius\u2019 programs may add uncertainty to its research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit its ability to take specified actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those programs and subject it to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Although Salarius might apply for government contracts and grants in the future, it cannot assure you that it will be successful in obtaining additional grants for any product candidates or programs. Failure to receive additional government grants in the future may substantially harm Salarius\u2019 business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Salarius\u2019 Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nSalarius may seek breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for one or more of its product candidates, but it might not receive such designation.\nSalarius may seek a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for some of its product candidates that reach the regulatory review process. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs or biological products that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA could also be eligible for accelerated approval.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if Salarius believes one of its product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation.\nA potential breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for Salarius\u2019 product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that Salarius\u2019 product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nThe receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of Salarius\u2019 product candidates qualify and are designated as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the drugs or biological products no longer meet the conditions for designation and the designation may be rescinded.\nSalarius received Fast Track designation for one or more of its product candidates, but such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a product candidate is intended for the treatment of a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need for this condition, a product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation. Salarius recently received Fast Track designation for a product candidate. However, Fast Track designation does not ensure that Salarius will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular time frame. Salarius may not experience a faster development or regulatory review or approval process with Fast Track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from Salarius\u2019 clinical development program. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures.\nEven if Salarius obtains regulatory approval for a product, Salarius will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements.\nIf any of Salarius\u2019 product candidates are approved, Salarius will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements with respect to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, marketing, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing clinical trials, and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-approval information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to continuously comply with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, regulations and corresponding foreign regulatory manufacturing requirements. As such, Salarius and its contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA or marketing authorization application.\nAny regulatory approvals that Salarius receives for its product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or\ncontain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Salarius will be required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. If its original marketing approval for a product candidate was obtained through an accelerated approval pathway, Salarius could be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical trial in order to confirm the clinical benefit for its products. An unsuccessful post-marketing clinical trial or failure to complete such a trial could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, the regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or Salarius, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If Salarius fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022issue warning letters;\n\u2022impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022suspend any of Salarius\u2019 ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by Salarius;\n\u2022impose restrictions on Salarius\u2019 operations, including closing its contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law would be expected to require Salarius to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate adverse publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect its ability to develop and commercialize its products and the value of Salarius and its operating results would be adversely affected.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs or otherwise change or reform the provision of healthcare products and services to the patient population. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d), was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Health Care Reform Law, among other things, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of specified branded prescription drugs, and promotes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted and Salarius expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for its product candidates, or additional pricing pressures.\nSalarius may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If Salarius is unable to comply, or has not fully complied, with such laws, it could face substantial penalties.\nIf Salarius obtains FDA approval for any of its product candidates and begins commercializing those products in the United States, its operations may be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without\nlimitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, its proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, Salarius may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which Salarius conduct its business. The laws that may affect its ability to operate include:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Health Care Reform Laws requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including governmental and private payors, to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of Salarius\u2019 business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf Salarius\u2019 operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to Salarius, Salarius may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to operate Salarius\u2019 business and its results of operations.\nReliance on government funding for Salarius\u2019 programs may add uncertainty to its research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs that are tied to such funding and may impose requirements that limit its ability to take specified actions, increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those programs and subject Salarius to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the course of Salarius\u2019 development of its product candidates, it has been funded in part through federal and state grants, including but not limited to the funding it received from CPRIT. If CPRIT terminates the agreement prior to the expiration due to an event of default or if Salarius terminates the agreement, CPRIT may require Salarius to repay some or all of the disbursed grant.\nIn addition to the funding Salarius has received to date, it intends to continue to apply for federal and state grants to receive additional funding in the future. Contracts and grants funded by the U.S. government, state governments and their related agencies include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022require repayment of all or a portion of the grant proceeds, in specified cases with interest, in the event Salarius violates specified covenants pertaining to various matters that include a failure to achieve specified milestones or to comply with terms relating to use of grant proceeds, or failure to comply with specified laws;\n\u2022terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022reduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022audit contract related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022impose qualifications for the engagement of manufacturers, suppliers and other contractors as well as other criteria for reimbursements;\n\u2022suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022control and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n\u2022pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u2022limit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nIn addition to those powers set forth above, the government funding Salarius may receive could also impose requirements to make payments based upon sales of its products, if any, in the future.\nSalarius may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using specified technologies developed by it, and Salarius may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including its competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. These and other provisions of government grants may also apply to intellectual property Salarius licenses now or in the future.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase Salarius\u2019 costs of doing business, reduce its profits, and expose it to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n\u2022mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022public disclosures of some contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into Salarius\u2019 research program; and\n\u2022mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf Salarius fails to maintain compliance with any such requirements that may apply to it now or in the future, Salarius may be subject to potential liability and to termination of Salarius\u2019 contracts.\nIf Salarius fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, Salarius could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs and liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSalarius\u2019 research and development activities and its third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of its product candidates and other hazardous compounds. Salarius and its manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at Salarius\u2019 and its manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. Salarius cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of its commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although Salarius believes that the safety procedures utilized by it and its third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, Salarius cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, Salarius may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed its resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail Salarius\u2019 use of specified materials and/or interrupt its business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. Salarius cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of its future compliance. Salarius does not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Salarius\u2019 Intellectual Property\nSalarius may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to its targets, product compounds and processes for its development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently, Salarius has rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents and patent applications that Salarius owns, to modulate only a subset of the known epigenetic enzyme targets. Because Salarius\u2019 programs may involve a range of targets, including targets that require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of its business may depend in part on Salarius\u2019 ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, Salarius\u2019 product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. Salarius may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that it identifies. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that Salarius may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over Salarius due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nFor example, Salarius has previously and may continue to collaborate with academic institutions worldwide to accelerate its pre-clinical and clinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such right of first negotiation for intellectual property, Salarius may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to it. If Salarius is unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking Salarius\u2019 ability to pursue its program.\nIn addition, companies that perceive Salarius to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to it. Salarius also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow it\nto make an appropriate return on its investment. If Salarius is unable to successfully obtain rights to third-party intellectual property rights, its business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nSalarius intends to rely on patent rights for its product candidates and any future product candidates. If Salarius is unable to obtain or maintain exclusivity from the combination of these approaches, Salarius may not be able to compete effectively in its markets.\nSalarius relies or will rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to its technologies and product candidates. Its success depends in large part on its and its licensors\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory exclusivity and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to its proprietary technology and products.\nSalarius has sought to protect its proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to its product candidates that are important to its business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and Salarius may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that Salarius will fail to identify patentable aspects of its research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsolved. The patent applications that Salarius owns or in-licenses may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover its product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to its patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover Salarius\u2019 product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability, or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, Salarius\u2019 patents and patent applications may not adequately protect its intellectual property, provide exclusivity for its product candidates, or prevent others from designing around Salarius claims. Any of these outcomes could impair Salarius\u2019 ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on its business.\nSalarius, independently or together with its licensors, has filed several patent applications covering various aspects of its product candidates. Salarius cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to Salarius after patent issuance could deprive Salarius of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that Salarius may develop. Further, if Salarius encounters delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which Salarius could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nIf Salarius cannot obtain and maintain effective protection of exclusivity from its regulatory efforts and intellectual property rights, including patent protection or data exclusivity, for its product candidates, Salarius may not be able to compete effectively and its business and results of operations would be harmed.\nSalarius may not have sufficient patent term protections for its product candidates to effectively protect its business.\nPatents have a limited term. In the United States, the statutory expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering its product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, Salarius may be open to competition from generic medications. In addition, upon issuance in the United States any patent term can be adjusted based on specified delays caused by the applicant(s) or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d).\nPatent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and under supplementary protection certificates in Europe may be available to extend the patent or data exclusivity terms of Salarius\u2019 product candidates. Salarius will likely rely on patent term extensions, and Salarius cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extensions will be obtained and, if so, for how long. As a result, Salarius may not be able to maintain exclusivity for its product candidates for an extended period after regulatory approval, if any, which would negatively impact its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If Salarius does not have\nsufficient patent terms or regulatory exclusivity to protect its product candidates, its business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing Salarius\u2019 ability to protect its products, and recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of its patent applications and the enforcement or defense of its issued patents.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, Salarius\u2019 success is heavily dependent on patents and the ability to enforce and protect these patients. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in specified circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in specified situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to Salarius\u2019 ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken Salarius\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce Salarius\u2019 existing patents and patents that it might obtain in the future. Some of Salarius\u2019 patent claims may be affected by the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics. In Myriad, the Supreme Court held that unmodified isolated fragments of genomic sequences, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are not eligible for patent protection because they constitute a product of nature. The exact boundaries of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision remain unclear as the Supreme Court did not address other types of nucleic acids.\nOn December 16, 2014, the USPTO issued guidance to patent examiners titled 2014 Interim Guidance on Patent Subject Matter Eligibility (Fed. Reg. 79 (241): 74618-33. These guidelines instruct USPTO examiners on the ramifications of the Prometheus and Myriad rulings and apply the Myriad ruling to natural products and principles including all naturally occurring nucleic acids. In addition, the USPTO continues to provide updates to its guidance and this is a developing area. The recent USPTO guidance could make it impossible for Salarius to pursue similar patent claims in patent applications Salarius may prosecute in the future.\nSalarius\u2019 patent portfolio contains claims of various types and scope, including chemically modified mimics, as well as methods of medical treatment. The presence of varying claims in Salarius\u2019 patent portfolio significantly reduces, but may not eliminate, its exposure to potential validity challenges under Myriad or future judicial decisions. However, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact this recent Supreme Court decision or future decisions will have on the operation of Salarius\u2019 business.\nFor Salarius\u2019 U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has promulgated regulations and developed procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not come into effect until March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of Salarius\u2019 business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of its patent applications and the enforcement or defense of its issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn important change introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before Salarius could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of Salarius\u2019 even if Salarius had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require Salarius to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, Salarius\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between its technology and the prior art allow its technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, Salarius cannot be certain that it was the first to either\n(i) file any patent application related to its product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in its patents or patent applications.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and new procedures providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. Included in these new procedures is a process known as Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d), which has been generally used by many third parties over the past two years to invalidate patents. The IPR process is not limited to patents filed after the Leahy-Smith Act was enacted, and would therefore be available to a third party seeking to invalidate any of Salarius\u2019 U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate Salarius\u2019 patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nIf Salarius is unable to maintain effective proprietary rights for its product candidates or any future product candidates, Salarius may not be able to compete effectively in its proposed markets.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, Salarius relies on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that Salarius elects not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of its product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Salarius seeks to protect its proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. Salarius also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of its premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. While Salarius has confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and Salarius may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, its trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough Salarius expects all of its employees and consultants to assign their inventions to Salarius, and all of its employees, consultants, advisors, and any third parties who have access to its proprietary know- how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, Salarius cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that its trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to its trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of Salarius\u2019 trade secrets could impair its competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain its trade secrets are deemed inadequate, Salarius may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay Salarius\u2019 development and commercialization efforts.\nSalarius\u2019 commercial success depends in part on its ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell its product candidates and use its proprietary technology without infringing the patent rights of third parties.\nNumerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications exist in the area of epigenetic enzyme inhibitors and related technologies. Salarius is aware of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties that cover therapeutic uses of epigenetic inhibitors. Salarius is currently monitoring these patents and patent applications. Salarius may in the future pursue available proceedings in the U.S. and foreign patent offices to challenge the validity of these patents and patent applications. In addition, or alternatively, Salarius may consider whether to seek to negotiate a license of rights to technology covered by one or more of such patents and patent applications. If any patents or patent applications cover its product candidates or technologies, Salarius may not be free to manufacture or market its product candidates, as planned, absent such a license, which may not be available to Salarius on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is also possible that Salarius has failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the\nUnited States remain confidential until patents issue. Moreover, it is difficult for industry participants, including Salarius, to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to its product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Salarius may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to its technology. In addition, Salarius may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of a current or future product candidate, or Salarius may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by its activities. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to specified limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover Salarius\u2019 technologies, its product candidates or the use of its product candidates.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which Salarius is developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that its product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nParties making claims against Salarius may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block its ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of its product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from its business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against Salarius, Salarius may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign its infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nSalarius may not be successful in meeting its obligations under its existing license agreements necessary to maintain its product candidate licenses in effect. In addition, if required in order to commercialize its product candidates, Salarius may be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to its product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nSalarius currently has rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents that Salarius does not own, to develop and commercialize its product candidates. Because its programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of its business will likely depend in part on its ability to maintain in effect these proprietary rights. Any termination of license agreements with third parties with respect to its product candidates would be expected to negatively impact its business prospects.\nSalarius may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that Salarius identifies as necessary for its product candidates.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that Salarius may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over Salarius due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive Salarius to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to Salarius. Even if Salarius is able to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that are necessary for its product candidates, there can be no assurance that they will be available on favorable terms.\nSalarius collaborates with academic institutions worldwide to identify product candidates, accelerate its research and conduct development. Typically, these institutions have provided Salarius with an option to negotiate an exclusive license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in the patents or other intellectual property resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, Salarius may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to Salarius. If Salarius is unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking its ability to pursue a program of interest to Salarius.\nIf Salarius is unable to successfully obtain and maintain rights to required third-party intellectual property, Salarius may have to abandon development of that product candidate or pay additional amounts to the third-party, and its business and financial condition could suffer.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of Salarius\u2019 product candidates is dependent on third parties.\nWhile Salarius normally seeks and gains the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to its product candidates, there may be times when patents relating to its product candidates are controlled by its licensors. If future licensors fail to appropriately and broadly prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of its product candidates, its ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and Salarius may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, importing, and selling competing products. In addition, even where Salarius now has the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications Salarius has licensed from third parties, Salarius may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of its licensors in effect from actions prior to Salarius assuming control over patent prosecution.\nIf Salarius fails to comply with obligations in the agreements under which Salarius licenses intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to its business relationships with its licensors, Salarius could lose license rights that are important to its business.\nSalarius is a party to intellectual property licenses and supply agreements that are important to its business and may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Salarius\u2019 existing agreements impose, and Salarius expects that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, purchasing, and other obligations on it. If Salarius fails to comply with its obligations under these agreements, or Salarius is subject to a bankruptcy, its agreements may be subject to termination by the licensor, in which event Salarius would not be able to develop, manufacture, or market products covered by the license or subject to supply commitments.\nSalarius may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents or the patents of its licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe Salarius\u2019 patents or the patents of its licensors. If Salarius or one of its licensing partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of its product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering its product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description, clarity or non- enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by Salarius or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to Salarius\u2019 patents or patent applications or those of its licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require Salarius to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Salarius\u2019 business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer Salarius a license on commercially reasonable terms. Its defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract its management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on its ability to raise the funds necessary to continue its clinical trials, continue its research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help Salarius bring its product candidates to market.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of Salarius\u2019 confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of its common stock.\nSalarius may be subject to claims that its employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that its employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nSalarius employs individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including Salarius\u2019 competitors or potential competitors. Although Salarius has written agreements and makes every effort to ensure that its employees, consultants, and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or intellectual property rights of others in their work for Salarius, Salarius may in the future be subject to any claims that its employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If Salarius fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, Salarius may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact its business. Even if Salarius is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nSalarius may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and its intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Competitors may use Salarius\u2019 technologies in jurisdictions where Salarius has not obtained patent protection to develop its own products and may also export infringing products to territories where Salarius has patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with its products and its patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly some developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for Salarius to stop the infringement of its patents or marketing of competing products in violation of its proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce Salarius\u2019 patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert Salarius\u2019 efforts and attention from other aspects of its business, could put Salarius\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and its patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against Salarius. Salarius may not prevail in any lawsuits that Salarius initiates and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, its efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that Salarius develops or licenses.\nRisks Related to Salarius\u2019 Reliance on Third Parties\nSalarius relies on or will rely on third parties to conduct its clinical trials, manufacture its product candidates and perform other services. If these third parties do not successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, Salarius may not be able to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize its product candidates and its business could be substantially harmed.\nSalarius has relied upon and plans to continue to rely upon third-parties such as CROs, hospitals, etc. to conduct, monitor and manage its ongoing clinical programs. Salarius relies on these parties for execution of clinical trials and manages and controls only some aspects of their activities. Salarius remains responsible for ensuring that each of its trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and its reliance on these third parties does not relieve Salarius of its regulatory responsibilities. Salarius and its CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, including those required by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of its product candidates in clinical development. If Salarius or any of its CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, the results generated in its clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require Salarius to perform additional clinical trials before approving its marketing applications. Salarius cannot be assured that its CROs and other vendors will meet these requirements, or that upon inspection by any regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that efforts, including any of its clinical trials, comply with applicable requirements. Its failure to comply with these laws, regulations and guidelines may require Salarius to repeat clinical trials, which would be costly and delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of Salarius\u2019 relationships with these third-parties terminate, Salarius may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third parties in a timely manner or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, third parties may not prioritize Salarius\u2019 clinical trials relative to those of other customers and any turnover in personnel or delays in the allocation of third party employees may negatively affect its clinical trials. If third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, Salarius\u2019 clinical trials may be delayed or terminated and Salarius may not be able to meet its current plans with respect to its product candidates. CROs, in particular, may also involve higher costs than anticipated, which could negatively affect Salarius\u2019 financial condition and operations.\nIn addition, Salarius does not currently have, nor does Salarius currently plan to establish the capability to manufacture product candidates for use in the conduct of its clinical trials, and Salarius lacks the resources and the capability to manufacture any of its product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale without the use of third-party manufacturers. Salarius plans to rely on third-party manufacturers and their responsibilities will include purchasing from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce its product candidates for its clinical trials and regulatory approval. There are expected to be a limited number of suppliers for the active ingredients and other materials that Salarius expects to use to manufacture its product candidates, and Salarius may not be able to identify alternative suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of its product candidates for its clinical trials, and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. Although Salarius generally does not expect to begin a clinical trial unless Salarius believes it has a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the trial, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a product candidate, or the active ingredient or other material components in the manufacture of the product candidate could delay completion of its clinical trials and potential timing for regulatory approval of its product candidates, which would harm its business and results of operations.\nSalarius expects to rely on third parties to manufacture its clinical product supplies, and Salarius intends to rely on third parties to produce and process its product candidates, if approved, and Salarius\u2019 commercialization of any of its product candidates could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain approval of government regulators, fail to provide Salarius with sufficient quantities of drug product, or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nSalarius does not currently have nor does it currently plan to develop the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture its clinical supplies for use in the conduct of Salarius\u2019 clinical trials, and Salarius lacks the resources and the capability to manufacture any of its product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Salarius currently relies on outside vendors to manufacture its clinical supplies of its product candidates and plans to continue relying on third parties to manufacture its product candidates on a commercial scale, if approved.\nSalarius does not yet have sufficient information to reliably estimate the cost of the commercial manufacturing of its product candidates and its current costs to manufacture its drug products is not commercially feasible, and the actual cost to manufacture its product candidates could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of its product candidates. As a result, Salarius may never be able to develop a commercially viable product.\nIn addition, Salarius\u2019 reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes Salarius to the following additional risks:\n\u2022Salarius may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022Salarius\u2019 third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture Salarius\u2019 product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet Salarius\u2019 clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u2022contract manufacturers may not be able to execute Salarius\u2019 manufacturing procedures appropriately;\n\u2022Salarius\u2019 future third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply its clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute its products;\n\u2022manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Salarius does not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u2022Salarius may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by Salarius\u2019 third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for its product candidates; and\n\u2022Salarius\u2019 third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreement with Salarius.\nEach of these risks could delay Salarius\u2019 clinical trials, the approval, if any of its product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of its product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive Salarius of potential product revenue. In addition, Salarius relies on third parties to perform release testing on its product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm and could result in product liability suits.\nThe manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in Salarius\u2019 supply of its product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Salarius cannot be assured that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of its product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, Salarius\u2019 manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If Salarius\u2019 manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, Salarius\u2019 ability to provide its product candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require Salarius to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nSalarius may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any current or future collaboration.\nSalarius has entered into strategic collaborations and license agreements with the University of Utah, HLBLS, and CPRIT. While Salarius may seek to enter into future collaborations for the development and commercialization of its product candidates, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. Even if Salarius is successful in entering into a collaboration with respect to the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful and Salarius may be unable to realize in full or in part the potential benefits of any of its current collaborations.\nCollaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022collaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n\u2022collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022any such collaboration may significantly limit Salarius\u2019 share of potential future profits from the associated program, and may require it to relinquish potentially valuable rights to its current product candidates, potential products or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to Salarius;\n\u2022collaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of Salarius\u2019 product candidates if the collaborators view its product candidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n\u2022disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u2022collaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u2022collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose Salarius to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022the collaborations may not result in Salarius achieving revenues to justify such transactions; and\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for Salarius to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of Salarius\u2019 product candidates.\nSalarius enters into various contracts in the normal course of its business in which Salarius indemnifies the other party to the contract. In the event Salarius has to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, Salarius periodically enters into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to Salarius\u2019 academic and other research agreements, Salarius typically indemnifies the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which Salarius has secured licenses, and from claims arising from Salarius\u2019 or its sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to Salarius\u2019 collaboration agreements, Salarius indemnifies its collaborators from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right by a third party. With respect to consultants, Salarius indemnifies them from claims arising from the good faith performance of their services.\nShould Salarius\u2019 obligation under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if Salarius were denied insurance coverage, Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if Salarius is relying on a collaborator to indemnify Salarius and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify Salarius, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Salarius\u2019 Product Candidates\nSalarius currently has very limited marketing and sales experience. If Salarius is unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell its product candidates, Salarius may be unable to generate any revenue.\nAlthough some of its employees may have marketed, launched, and sold other pharmaceutical products in the past while employed at other companies, Salarius has no experience selling and marketing its product candidates and Salarius currently has no marketing or sales organization. To successfully commercialize any products that may result from its development programs, Salarius will need to find one or more collaborators to commercialize its products or invest in and develop these capabilities, either on its own or with others, which would be expensive, difficult and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the timely development of Salarius\u2019 internal commercialization capabilities could adversely impact the potential for success of its products.\nIf commercialization collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize its future products and Salarius is unable to develop the necessary marketing and sales capabilities on its own, Salarius will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain or grow its business. Salarius may be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations, particularly in the markets its product candidates are intended to address. Without appropriate capabilities, whether directly or through third-party collaborators, Salarius may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nSalarius may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to its product candidates, but it may not be able to do so, which may cause it to alter its development and commercialization plans.\nSalarius may attempt to form strategic collaborations, create joint ventures or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to its programs that it believes will complement or augment its existing business. Salarius may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time consuming and complex. Salarius may not be successful in its efforts to establish such a strategic collaboration for any product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all.\nThis may be because Salarius\u2019 product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, its research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, the competitive or intellectual property landscape may be viewed as too intense or risky, and/or third parties may not view its product candidates and programs as having sufficient potential for commercialization, including the likelihood of an adequate safety and efficacy profile.\nAny delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop and/or commercialize Salarius\u2019 product candidates could delay the development or commercialization of its product candidates, which may reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Absent a strategic collaborator, Salarius would need to undertake development and/or commercialization activities at its own expense. If Salarius elects to fund and undertake development and/or commercialization activities on its own, it may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. If Salarius is unable to do so, it may not be able to develop its product candidates or bring them to market and its business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the market opportunities for its product candidates are smaller than Salarius believes they are, Salarius may not meet its future revenue expectations and, assuming approval of a product candidate, its business may suffer.\nGiven the small number of patients who have the diseases that Salarius is targeting, its eligible patient population and pricing estimates may differ significantly from the actual market addressable by its product candidates. For example, based off data from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and physician collaborators, Salarius believes that there are approximately 500 Ewing sarcoma patients diagnosed annually in the United States. Because the patient populations in the market for its product candidates may be small, Salarius must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve profitability and growth, which would negatively affect its revenue and operating results.\nSalarius faces substantial competition and its competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than Salarius.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Salarius faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to oncology therapies and the other product candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. The list of companies working on some form of cancer treatment is almost limitless with big and small companies working on every aspect of oncology therapies worldwide.\nIf Salarius\u2019 competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than Salarius, it could result in its competitors establishing a strong market position before Salarius is able to enter the market.\nMany of Salarius\u2019 competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than it does. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in its competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in pre-clinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with Salarius\u2019 competitors. Failure of Seclidemstat or other product candidates to effectively compete against established treatment options or in the future with new products currently in development would harm Salarius\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of any of Salarius\u2019 current or future product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.\nEven if Salarius obtains the necessary approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the commercial success of Salarius\u2019 products will depend in part on the health care providers, patients, and third-party payors accepting its product candidates as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that Salarius\nbrings to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors. The degree of market acceptance of any of Salarius\u2019 products will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials and potential advantages over competing treatments;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of the disease and any side effects;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which approval is granted, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022the convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the cost of treatment;\n\u2022the willingness of the patients and physicians to accept these therapies;\n\u2022the perceived ratio of risk and benefit of these therapies by physicians and the willingness of physicians to recommend these therapies to patients based on such risks and benefits;\n\u2022the marketing, sales and distribution support for the product;\n\u2022the publicity concerning its products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022the pricing and availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile upon approval, market acceptance of the product remains uncertain. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of the products may require significant investment and resources and may never be successful. If its products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and other health care providers, Salarius will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable.\nSalarius may not be successful in any efforts to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates.\nAlthough a substantial amount of Salarius\u2019 effort will focus on the continued clinical testing, potential approval, and commercialization of its existing product candidates, the success of Salarius\u2019 business is also expected to depend in part upon its ability to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates.\nResearch programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. Salarius may focus its efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Salarius\u2019 research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022Salarius\u2019 research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022Salarius may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022its product candidates may not succeed in pre-clinical or clinical testing;\n\u2022its potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022competitors may develop alternatives that render Salarius\u2019 product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022product candidates Salarius develops may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022the market for a product candidate may change during Salarius\u2019 program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, or third-party payors.\nIf any of these events occur, Salarius may be forced to abandon its development efforts for a program or programs, or Salarius may not be able to identify, license, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations and could potentially cause Salarius to cease operations.\nFailure to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement or insurance coverage for products when approved to market, if any, could limit Salarius\u2019 ability to market those products and decrease its ability to generate revenue.\nThe pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of Salarius\u2019 approved products, if any, must be sufficient to support its commercial efforts and other development programs and the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of Salarius\u2019 approved products, if any, will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of its approved products, if any, will be paid for or reimbursed by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or government payors and private payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only in limited amounts, Salarius may have to subsidize or provide products for free or Salarius may not be able to successfully commercialize its products.\nIn addition, there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new drugs are typically made by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, (\u201cCMS\u201d), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel product candidates such as Salarius\u2019 and what reimbursement codes its product candidates may receive if approved.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other price-restrictive regulations, and Salarius believes the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of products. In many countries, the prices of products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that Salarius is able to charge for its products, if any. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the potential revenue may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and private payors in the United States and abroad to limit or reduce healthcare costs may result in restrictions on coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for its products. Salarius expects to experience pricing pressures in connection with products due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs has and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As a result, profitability of Salarius\u2019 products, if any, may be more difficult to achieve even if they receive regulatory approval.\nRisks Related to Salarius\u2019 Business Operations\nSalarius\u2019 future success depends in part on its ability to retain its president and chief executive officer and to attract, retain, and motivate other qualified personnel.\nSalarius is a small company with a limited number of employees performing multiple tasks each. Salarius is highly dependent on David J. Arthur, its president and chief executive officer, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of its objectives. Although Mr. Arthur\u2019s employment agreement contains a non-compete provision for a period of one year following the termination of his employment agreement, he could leave Salarius\u2019\nemployment at any time, as he is an \u201cat will\u201d employee. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants, and advisors for Salarius\u2019 business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to Salarius success. There is currently a shortage of highly qualified personnel in Salarius\u2019 industry, which is likely to continue. Additionally, this shortage of highly qualified personnel is particularly acute in the area where Salarius is located. As a result, competition for personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. Salarius may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in development and commercialization of Salarius\u2019 product candidates may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or the loss of the services of Mr. Arthur may impede the progress of Salarius\u2019 research, development, and commercialization objectives and would negatively impact Salarius\u2019 ability to succeed in its product development strategy.\nSalarius will need to expand its organization and Salarius may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt its operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Salarius had 7 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. As Salarius\u2019 development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, Salarius expects to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, legal, and other resources. Its management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Salarius may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations, which may result in weaknesses in its infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Salarius\u2019 expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If its management is unable to effectively manage its growth, its expenses may increase more than expected, its ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and Salarius may not be able to implement its business strategy. Salarius\u2019 future financial performance and its ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe terms of the warrants could impede our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing.\nThe terms of the warrants require us, upon the consummation of any \u201cfundamental transaction\u201d (as defined in the securities), to, among other obligations, cause any successor entity resulting from the fundamental transaction to assume all of our obligations under the warrants and the associated transaction documents. In addition, holders of warrants are entitled to participate in any fundamental transaction on an as-converted or as-exercised basis, which could result in the holders of our common stock receiving a lesser portion of the consideration from a fundamental transaction. The terms of the warrants could also impede our ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain additional financing in the future.\nFuture sales of a significant number of our shares of common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our shares of our common stock or cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, including from the exercise of warrants or sales of common stock issuable thereunder, could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. A substantial number of shares of common stock are being offered by this prospectus. We cannot predict the number of these shares that might be sold nor the effect that future sales of our shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants, would have on the market price of our shares of common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nAt the present time, we intend to use available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the discretion of our board of directors, we have no intention of paying any such dividends in\nthe foreseeable future. Any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another reputable stock exchange, it may be more difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities.\nNasdaq requires listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, Nasdaq should delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our stockholders.\nFor example, if at any time the bid price of our common stock closes at below $1.00 per share for more than 30 consecutive trading days, we may be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we receive a delisting notice, we would have 180 calendar days to regain compliance (subject to any additional 180-day compliance period which may be available to us), which would mean having a bid price above the minimum of $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive days in the 180-day period. During this 180-day period, we would anticipate reviewing our options to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirements, including conducting a reverse stock split. To the extent that we are unable to resolve any listing deficiency, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock and potentially result in even lower bid prices for our common stock. On March 15, 2021, the closing price of our common stock was $1.62 per share.\nGeneral Risks\nFailure in Salarius\u2019 information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of Salarius\u2019 business and/or lead to potential large liabilities.\nSalarius\u2019 ability to execute its business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its information technology systems. Information technology systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of Salarius\u2019 and its vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information which in turn could lead to operational difficulties and liabilities.\nA security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure of consumer, customer, supplier, partner or employee information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information) could harm Salarius\u2019 reputation, compel Salarius to comply with disparate state and foreign breach notification laws and otherwise subject it to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nThe techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, Salarius may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If its computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions, and it could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect its information technology systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt Salarius\u2019 ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect its ability to operate its business. In addition, a data security breach could distract management or other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties.\nThe interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. Among other things, foreign privacy laws impose significant obligations on U.S. companies to protect the personal information of foreign citizens. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with Salarius\u2019 data practices, which could have a material adverse effect on Salarius\u2019 business. Complying with these various laws could cause Salarius to incur substantial costs or require it to change its business practices in a manner adverse to its business.\nWe may face business disruption and related risks resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has spread worldwide. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect the Company\u2019s operations and those of third parties on which the Company relies. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to access capital, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s long-term liquidity. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, clinical trials or the drug procurement, financing, or other activities or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, capital resources, operations, and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting the United States, global economies, and businesses worldwide. While the potential magnitude and duration of the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact on the global financial markets may, in the future, reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic could also have a material and negative impact on our liquidity, capital resources (including our ability to secure additional financing if and when needed), our business and operations, and our workforce, as well as those of the third parties with which we do business or upon which we rely. While the situation is fluid and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on us or on healthcare systems or the global economy in general, at this time, we are experiencing minimal disruption to our clinical trials and have experienced no disruptions to manufacturing capabilities. However, we may experience disruptions in the future that have and could further adversely impact our business operations, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and certain aspects of our supply chain may be disrupted as certain of our third party suppliers and manufacturers have paused their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or have otherwise encountered delays in providing supplies and services. We continue to evaluate the extent to which these delays will impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct other research and development operations and maintain applicable timelines. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials remains uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted.", "PERMNO": 15177, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SLRX"}
