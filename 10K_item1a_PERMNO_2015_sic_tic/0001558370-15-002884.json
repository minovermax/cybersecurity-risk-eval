{"cik": "1644378", "company": "RMR Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading \u201cWarning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from the provision of business and property management services to our Client Companies. The loss or failure of any of the Managed REITs or a decline in its business, assets or market capitalization could substantially reduce our revenues.\nThe fees paid to us by our Client Companies comprise substantially all our revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the percentages of our total revenues earned from each of our Client Companies was as follows: GOV (15.0%), HPT (21.2%), SIR (16.7%), SNH (27.6%), Five Star (4.7%), Sonesta (1.0%), TA (7.4%), AIC (0.1%), RIF (1.2%) and RMR Trust (1.8%). Therefore, our ability to maintain and grow our revenues depends upon the ability of our Client Companies to maintain and grow their respective businesses. Reduced business activities by, or failure of, any of the Managed REITs or the termination of their management agreements with us would materially reduce our revenues and our profitability.\nOur revenues depend in large part on the ability of our Client Companies to raise capital to invest in real estate assets or their other respective businesses and on the positive performance of the investments or businesses of our Client Companies, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. See \u201c-Risks Related to the Businesses of our Client Companies.\u201d Our business management agreement with each Managed REIT provides for a base management fee which is based on the lesser of the historical costs of the Managed REIT\u2019s assets under management or its total market capitalization, as defined in the business management agreement, and an incentive management fee which is based on the Managed REIT\u2019s relative outperformance of a specified REIT total shareholder return index. As a result, the management fees we earn from a Managed REIT may increase or decrease as the Managed REIT acquires or disposes of real estate assets or its market capitalization increases or decreases. Further, our ability to earn incentive fees under our agreements with the Managed REITs will be primarily driven by their outperformance as compared with their respective\npeers, based on total stockholder return. The shareholder returns realized by a Managed REIT, its market capitalization and its ability to raise capital or make investments may be impacted by trends in the Managed REIT\u2019s portfolio, the U.S. real estate industry generally, the Managed REIT\u2019s industry specifically or other factors which are outside of our or its control. A severe or sustained decline in the market capitalization or business of a Managed REIT could significantly decrease the fees we earn from that Managed REIT. Similarly, the fees under our management agreements with the Managed Operators are based on a percentage of revenues (in the case of TA, gross fuel margin and non-fuel revenues) earned by them. A material decline in the revenues of the Managed Operators may materially reduce our revenues. There can also be no assurance that we will maintain the level of revenues we have earned in the past under our management agreements with our Client Companies or that the amount of fees we receive will increase. It is possible that the revenues we earn will fluctuate significantly or materially decline.\nRising market interest rates may significantly reduce our revenues.\nSince the most recent recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time. In December 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Market interest rates may continue to increase and the increase may materially and negatively affect us. One of the factors that investors typically consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell the common shares of the Managed REITs and which they may consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell our Class A Common Shares is the distribution rate with respect to such shares relative to prevailing market interest rates. If market interest rates go up, investors may expect a higher distribution rate before investing in our Class A Common Shares or in a Managed REIT or may sell our Class A Common Shares or the Managed REITs\u2019 common shares and seek alternate investments with a higher distribution rate. Sales of our Class A Common Shares may cause the market value of such shares to decline. Sales of common shares of the Managed REITs may cause a decline in the market prices of such shares which reduces the market capitalizations and total shareholder returns of the Managed REITs, which, in turn, may materially reduce the fees we earn under our business management agreements with them. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could raise borrowing costs for our Client Companies, negatively impact their access to capital to fund future growth and reduce their total shareholder returns, which may materially reduce the fees we earn under our business management agreements with them.\nOur management agreements with our Client Companies are subject to termination, and any such terminations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management agreements with our Client Companies may be terminated by a Client Company or by us in certain circumstances. Depending upon the circumstances of a termination, we may or may not be entitled to receive a termination fee. If any of our management agreements with a Client Company is terminated, we may be unable to replace the lost revenue. Even if we receive a termination fee upon the termination of a management agreement with a Client Company, we may be unable to invest the after tax proceeds of the termination fee we receive to replace the lost revenues. The termination of our management agreements with any of our Client Companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe commercial real estate industry has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the United States generally.\nOur business and operations are significantly dependent on the commercial real estate industry, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions in the United States. Commercial real estate markets in the United States were significantly negatively impacted during the recent recession. Although commercial real estate markets have improved, with valuations approaching, and in some cases exceeding, 2007 levels, new challenges have arisen, including uncertain U.S. Federal Reserve policy regarding the timing and amount of future increases in interest rates and increasing real estate development activities. Adverse conditions in the commercial real estate industry could harm our business and financial condition by limiting our and our Client Companies\u2019 access to debt and equity capital and our and their ability\nto grow our and their businesses. If we do not increase the number of clients to which we provide services or if our Client Companies do not grow their businesses, our income may not grow and it may decline.\nThe asset management business is highly competitive.\nOur business is highly competitive and our success will be determined by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7 other asset managers may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than our Client Companies and we do;\n\u00b7 our Client Companies may not perform as well as other companies, including companies managed by other asset managers;\n\u00b7 other asset managers and the companies that compete with our Client Companies may have access to more capital or access to capital at lower costs than our Client Companies and we do;\n\u00b7 other asset managers and the companies that compete with the Client Companies may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to acquire a wider variety of assets and a broader range of investments and as a result we and our Client Companies may grow our business less and slower than those competitors;\n\u00b7 there are few barriers to entry into the asset management business and new entrants will result in increased competition;\n\u00b7 other asset managers may have more scalable platforms and may operate more efficiently than we do;\n\u00b7 other asset managers may have better brand recognition than we have; and\n\u00b7 our competitors may from time to time recruit our employees away from us.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe and our clients are subject to the risk of litigation, derivative claims, securities class actions, regulatory and governmental investigations and other litigation including proceedings arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our clients and our clients\u2019 relationships with us and amongst themselves. If any claims were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, the finding could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously adversely impact our business. Allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, regardless of veracity, may harm our reputation and adversely impact the ability of our Client Companies\u2019 and us to grow our respective businesses.\nIf we cannot retain and motivate our key personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new key personnel, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends to a great extent on our ability to retain and motivate our Founders and other key personnel and strategically to recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel. However, we may not be successful in these efforts as the market for qualified employees in the asset management industry is extremely competitive. Historically we have not had employment agreements with our key employees and we have no present\nintention to enter into any. Our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our personnel is dependent on our ability to offer attractive compensation. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash available to continue to offer our employees attractive compensation. In addition, we or our Client Companies may be unwilling to grant our employees significant equity awards in our business, and the value of any equity awards they receive may be lower than anticipated. Also, in order to recruit and retain existing and future personnel, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them, which may cause a higher amount of our revenue to be paid out in the form of compensation, which may have an adverse impact on our profits.\nWe depend on our Founders and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our Founders and other key personnel. The extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and of the relationships they have with real estate professionals and financial institutions, although not a guarantee of positive results, are critical to the success of our business. The loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and cash flows and could impair our ability to maintain or grow assets under management in our Client Companies or otherwise maintain or grow our business.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and numerous contractual obligations and internal policies and failure to comply with these provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation and numerous contractual obligations and internal policies. We are subject to, or expect to be subject to, regulation by the SEC, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, and other federal, state and local or international governmental bodies and agencies or self regulatory organizations. We are also responsible for managing or assisting the regulatory aspects of our Client Companies, including compliance with applicable REIT rules and, in the case of RIF, the Investment Company Act. The level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. These regulations are extensive, complex and require substantial management time and attention. Our failure to comply with any of the regulations, contractual obligations or policies may subject us to extensive investigations, as well as substantial penalties, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur lack of compliance with applicable law could result in, among other things, our inability to enforce contracts, our default under contracts (including our management agreements with our Client Companies) and our ineligibility to contract with, and receive revenue from, governmental authorities and agencies, our Client Companies or other third parties. We have numerous contractual obligations with which we must comply on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have established internal policies designed to ensure that we manage our business in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in accordance with our contractual obligations. These internal policies may not be effective in all regards; and, if we fail to comply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of employees and tenants and lease data.\nWe rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant, customer and vendor information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we take various actions to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches,\nincluding physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.\nOne of our subsidiaries, RMR Advisors, is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to registered investment advisors is complex and RMR Advisors\u2019s failure to do so may adversely impact our business.\nOur subsidiary, RMR Advisors, is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous obligations, including compliance, record keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and limitations on certain activities. Investment advisers also owe fiduciary duties to their clients. These regulatory and fiduciary obligations may result in increased costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. If RMR Advisors fails to meet its compliance and fiduciary obligations under the Investment Advisers Act, it may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or it may be unable or no longer permitted to provide investment advisory services to RIF or other clients.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, reputational harm and loss of business.\nThere is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the companies and assets we manage. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees may adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees improperly use or disclose confidential information, we and the concerned client could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships, as well as face potentially significant litigation. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If any of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected, and such conduct might rise to the level of a default that would permit a Client Company to terminate its management agreements with us for cause and without paying us a termination fee, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRMR LLC\u2019s required quarterly tax distributions may limit our ability to implement our business or pursue growth opportunities.\nThe LLC Operating Agreement requires RMR LLC to make certain pro rata distributions to each member of RMR LLC, including RMR Inc., quarterly on the basis of the assumed tax liabilities of the members. From time to time, RMR LLC\u2019s cash flows from operations may be insufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax distributions to its members. RMR LLC may have to borrow funds or sell assets, and thereby materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Further, by making cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise. In such event, we may not be able to implement our business and growth strategy to the extent intended. In addition, we may have to borrow additional amounts to fund our operations or make capital expenditures, in which case our borrowing costs would increase and our liquidity would be negatively impacted.\nWe may incur costs in excess of our expectations as an independent public company.\nWe are a new public company. We may incur costs and expenses greater than those we anticipated as a result of becoming a publicly owned company. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting, costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Investment Advisers Act), tax administration, and legal and human resources related functions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient returns to pay our operating expenses and make satisfactory distributions to our shareholders or any distributions at all.\nRisks Related to the Businesses of our Client Companies\nRisks associated with our Client Companies\u2019 businesses generally could adversely affect their respective abilities to grow, generate revenue and pay management fees to us and, thereby, adversely affect our business.\nWe have presented in this annual report historical fees that we have earned from our clients. The historical fees earned from our clients, including those presented in this annual report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our Client Companies or of our future results. The risks associated with each of the Client Companies\u2019 businesses could adversely affect its ability to carry out its business plans and objectives, and, as a result, could adversely impact its ability to pay us our management fees or cause the amounts of those fees to decline. We may experience difficulty replacing the revenue we lost when our management agreements with EQC were terminated. For more information see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-OVERVIEW-REITs.\u201d\nRisks to our Client Companies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 the Managed REITs face competition for tenants at substantially all of their properties and competing properties may be more attractive to tenants;\n\u00b7 our Client Companies face significant competition for investment opportunities from other real estate investors, some of which have greater financial resources, including publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, banking firms, private institutional funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and other investors;\n\u00b7 rising interest rates may increase operating costs, reduce the value of properties and make raising capital difficult for our Client Companies;\n\u00b7 changing general economic and financial market conditions could significantly reduce the value of the real estate and other investments of our Client Companies and reduce the amounts earned on those investments;\n\u00b7 changes in investor preferences or market conditions could limit our Client Companies\u2019 ability to raise capital to properly maintain their properties and operations or make new investments;\n\u00b7 shareholder activism, complaints about management strategies and structures, corporate governance and other matters may divert management attention and be disruptive to the operation of our Client Companies;\n\u00b7 changes in tax laws, regulation or accounting rules may make certain types of investments by our Client Companies less valuable;\n\u00b7 our Client Companies are exposed to environmental, building and other laws, natural disasters and other factors beyond their control as a result of their ownership of real estate;\n\u00b7 our Client Companies have significant investments in certain types of assets, such as hotels, senior living communities, healthcare properties, travel centers and convenience stores, and market changes which impact these specific types of assets (e.g., new competition for short term accommodations, changes in Medicare and Medicaid rates and fuel efficiency improvements) may adversely impact certain of the Client Companies\u2019 ability to maintain or grow their business;\n\u00b7 a Managed REIT\u2019s failure to continue to qualify as a REIT would subject it to federal income tax and reduce cash available for distributions to its shareholders, adversely impacting its ability to raise capital and operate its business; and\n\u00b7 complying with REIT requirements may cause the Managed REITs to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nSome of our Client Companies are SEC registrants and file reports with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act. A discussion of the businesses and the risks associated with the businesses of our Client Companies that are SEC registrants is disclosed in the reports filed by our Client Companies, including in the section captioned \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in each of the Managed REITs\u2019, Five Star\u2019s and TA\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Copies of these reports are available at the SEC\u2019s website, www.sec.gov.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nA trading market that provides adequate liquidity may not develop or be sustained for our Class A Common Shares and the market price of our Class A Common Shares may fluctuate widely.\nThe majority of the securities representing the economic interest in our business are currently held by RMR Trust and the Managed REITs and have not been registered for public sale. Our public float represents only about 22.8% of the economic interest in RMR LLC, which may adversely impact trading in our Class A Common Shares. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Class A Common Shares will develop or be sustained in the future.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 a relatively thin trading market for our Class A Common Shares could cause trades of small blocks of shares to have a significant impact on the price of our Class A Common Shares;\n\u00b7 our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7 announcements by us, our Client Companies or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u00b7 the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A Common Shares;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u00b7 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7 overall market fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nStock markets in general often experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Shares. Our shareholders may not be able to resell their Class A Common Shares following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility.\nSubstantial sales of the Class A Common Shares may occur following the Distribution which could cause the market price of our Class A Common Shares to decline.\nIt is possible that many of the Managed REITs\u2019 shareholders will sell the Class A Common Shares they received in the Distribution in the public market because our business profile or market capitalization does not fit their investment objectives, because our Class A Common Shares are not included in certain indices or for other reasons. The sales of significant amounts of the Class A Common Shares or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our Class A Common Shares. We can offer no assurance that the Managed REITs\u2019 shareholders will continue to hold the Class A Common Shares they receive.\nThe reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d may make our Class A Common Shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements of public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, an exemption from complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may remain an emerging growth company until to September 30, 2021. If some investors find our Class A Common Shares less attractive as a result of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A Common Shares and the trading price of our Class A Common Shares may be more volatile than that of an otherwise comparable company that does not avail itself of the same or similar exemptions. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A Common Shares less attractive because we rely on the JOBS Act exemptions.\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. We have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period, which means that when a financial accounting standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, as an emerging growth company, we can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This transition period may make comparison of our financial statements with those of another public company which either is not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAs a public company, we incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are a new public company. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the listing requirements of NASDAQ and other applicable securities rules and regulations. These rules and regulations increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly, particularly after we cease to be an emerging growth company. For example,\nthese rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers. Our management team and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these and other compliance initiatives and we may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to becoming a public company. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff, which would require us to incur additional expenses and harm our results of operations. In addition, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. We may also need to hire more employees in the future in order to comply with these requirements, which may increase our costs and expenses.\nOur shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nOur shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of our future issuance of equity or equity linked securities and our grant of equity awards to our directors, executive officers and employees.\nOur dividend policy is subject to change.\nSubject to applicable law, RMR Inc. currently plans to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend initially equal to $0.25 per share ($1.00 per share per year) to holders of its Class A Common Shares. We expect that our first dividend declared after the Distribution will be a dividend of $0.2993 per Class A Common Share, which represents a dividend of $0.25 per Class A Common Share for the quarter ending March 31, 2016 plus a pro rata dividend in respect of the period from and including the Distribution Date through and including December 31, 2015 and that this dividend will be paid in the second calendar quarter of 2016. Holders of our outstanding Class B-1 Common Shares are entitled to receive the same dividends per Class B-1 Common Share as may be declared per outstanding Class A Common Share.\nWe are a holding company and our only material assets are our membership interests in RMR LLC. We intend to cause RMR LLC to make distributions to us in an amount that will be sufficient to cover dividends, if any, we declare. When RMR LLC makes such distributions, each other holder of class A membership units of RMR LLC will be entitled to receive pro rata distributions from RMR LLC on its class A membership units.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends to our shareholders will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which may change the distribution policy or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Our Founders and Our Client Companies\nOur Founders control our voting power and our other shareholders will have less influence over our business than shareholders of most other publicly owned companies.\nSubstantially all of the voting power in RMR Inc. and a majority of the economic interest in RMR LLC is held by RMR Trust, an entity owned by our Founders. RMR Trust holds a combined 51.6% direct and indirect economic interest in RMR LLC and controls 91.4% of RMR Inc.\u2019s voting power through its beneficial ownership of all of our outstanding Class B-1 and Class B-2 Common Shares, which entitle holders to ten votes per share. See \u201cBusiness-Our Organizational Structure.\u201d RMR Inc. serves as the managing member of RMR LLC. Accordingly, our Founders, through RMR Trust, hold majority control of RMR Inc.\u2019s voting power and thereby control RMR LLC.\nAs a result of its voting control, RMR Trust is effectively able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including, but not limited to, election of our directors. RMR Trust is also able to cause or prevent a change of control of RMR Inc. and this voting control could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of RMR Inc. RMR Trust\u2019s voting control could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A Common Shares as part of a sale of us and may affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nOur management agreements with the Managed REITs may discourage our change of control.\nEach Managed REIT may terminate its management agreements with us if we experience a change of control, as defined in those agreements, without payment of any termination fee. We may be unable to duplicate the long term management arrangements we have with each of the Managed REITs. For these reasons, the management agreements may discourage a change of control of us, including a change of control which might result in payment of a premium for our Class A Common Shares.\nThe registration of one of our subsidiaries under the Investment Advisers Act may discourage our change of control.\nOur subsidiary, RMR Advisors, is registered as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act. Any change in control of RMR Advisors, as defined in and interpreted pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act, would trigger a shareholder approval right by RIF shareholders under that Act. The need for approval of RIF\u2019s shareholders may discourage a change of control of us, including a change of control which might result in payment of a premium for our Class A Common Shares.\nRMR Trust\u2019s and the Managed REITs\u2019 ability to sell their respective ownership stakes in us and speculation about such possible sales may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares.\nRMR Trust and the Managed REITs are not prohibited from selling some or all of our shares and may do so without approval by other shareholders of RMR Inc. RMR Trust also has the right to redeem its class A membership units for Class A Common Shares, for which we expect there will be a public market, or we may elect to pay cash instead of issuing more common shares. Speculation by the press, stock analysts, our shareholders or others regarding RMR Trust\u2019s or any Managed REIT\u2019s intention to dispose of our shares could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Shares. As long as a significant portion of our ownership is not trading in the public markets, the market price of our Class A Common Shares may be adversely impacted. Accordingly, our Class A Common Shares may be worth less than they would be if the Class A Common Shares owned by RMR Trust or the Managed REITs or which RMR Trust has a right to acquire were trading in the public markets.\nThe Up-C Transaction and the agreements entered into as part of the Up-C Transaction are among related parties, which increases the risk of allegations of conflicts of interest, and such allegations may impair our ability to realize the benefits we expect from the Up-C Transaction.\nBecause of the relationships among us, our Founders and the Managed REITs, including that our Founders are the managing trustees of each Managed REIT and are our controlling shareholders, the executive officers of the Managed REITs are our officers and employees and we provide management services to the Managed REITs, the Up-C Transaction and the agreements entered into as part of the Up-C Transaction, including the amendment and extension of the management agreements to 20 year terms, are among related parties. When our Founders presented a proposal to the respective boards of trustees of the Managed REITs for a transaction that led to the Up-C Transaction, the board of trustees of each Managed REIT formed a special committee comprised of its independent trustees and a joint special committee comprised of the independent trustees of the Managed REITs to evaluate and respond to the proposal. The joint special committee was advised by counsel and a financial advisor and the special committee of each Managed REIT was also advised by a separate financial advisor to assist in evaluating the proposal. The Up-C Transaction was unanimously recommended by the joint special committee and approved by the special committee of each Managed REIT. Nonetheless, the Up-C Transaction may not be on terms as favorable to us or the Managed REITs as it would have been if it was negotiated among unrelated parties. We are subject to the risk that our shareholders or the shareholders of the Managed REITs may challenge the Up-C Transaction and the agreements entered into as part of the Up-C Transaction. If such a challenge were to be successful, we might not realize the benefits we expect from the Up-C Transaction. Moreover, any such challenge could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and growth and could adversely affect our\nability to realize the benefits we expect from the Up-Transaction, whether or not the allegations have merit or are substantiated.\nOur management responsibilities to each of our Client Companies and any future companies we may manage may give rise to actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest.\nSome of our Client Companies have overlapping investment objectives. Additionally, some of our Client Companies have material business relationships with each other that could give rise to conflicting interests. We anticipate that our Client Companies will acquire assets consistent with their investment objectives and that we identify for them. In so doing, we expect that our Client Companies may rely primarily on information we provide to them. While we and our Client Companies have policies and procedures in place that are intended to mitigate the risks of conflicts of interest, our allocation of investment opportunities, advice and commitments of our management team across our Client Companies might be perceived to favor one Client Company at the expense of another.\nIn addition to serving on our Board of Directors and executive team, at least one of our Founders also serves on the boards of each of our Client Companies. Many of the executive officers of our Client Companies are also our officers. These individuals may also hold equity positions in, or other positions with, us and our Client Companies. In addition, RMR Trust and some of our Client Companies participate in a combined insurance program through AIC and we and the Managed REITs, Five Star and TA participate in a combined directors and officers insurance program. These multiple responsibilities and varying interests could create competition for the time and efforts of RMR LLC and our Founders and actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest may arise.\nIn the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholder litigation, dissident shareholder director nominations and dissident shareholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. Our relationships with our Founders and our Client Companies and the relationships among our Client Companies may precipitate such activities; and these activities, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention regardless of merit.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nThe historical consolidated financial information in this annual report may not permit current or prospective investors to predict our future results of operations.\nWe are a recently formed company and a new public company. Our historical consolidated financial information is comprised of the accounts of RMR LLC, RMR Advisors and RMR Intl and are presented as if these entities were wholly owned, operated and consolidated within a single legal entity. Accordingly, this financial information may not be representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nIn addition, the historical consolidated financial information in this annual report does not reflect all the added costs we will incur as a public company, including costs related to public company reporting, investor relations and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of these matters, among others, it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business. For more information on our historical financial information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nOur Founders, through their ownership of RMR Trust, hold more than 50.0% of the voting power of our shares eligible to vote. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50.0% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain listed company governance requirements, including the requirements that the board of directors be majority comprised of independent directors and that we have a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. These exemptions do not modify the independence requirements for our audit committee, and we intend to comply with the applicable requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ with respect to our audit committee. Nonetheless, the fact that we intend to avail ourselves of some or all of these exceptions may cause our Class A Common Shares to trade at a lower price than if these protections were provided.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and the market price of our Class A Common Shares may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and therefore we currently may avail ourselves of certain exemptions from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, we will eventually be required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial results and the market price of our Class A Common Shares may decline.\nOur rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nOur governing documents limit the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our shareholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u00b7 actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u00b7 active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nAdditionally, our governing documents require us to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, any of our present or former directors or executive officers who is made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. We also entered into separate agreements with our directors and executive officers providing for indemnification and advancement of expenses in addition to any rights such person may have under our governing documents.\nAs a result of these limitations on liability and indemnification obligations, we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our present and former directors and officers than might exist with other companies, which could limit shareholder recourse in the event of actions which some shareholders may not believe are not in our best interest.\nOur governing documents currently designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or, if that court does not have jurisdiction the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur governing documents currently provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or if that court does not have jurisdiction the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a duty owed by any director, officer, manager or employee of ours to us or our shareholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, manager or employee of ours arising pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a shareholder; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, manager or employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our Class A Common Shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our governing documents described above, as they may be amended from time to time.\nDisputes with our Founders and our Client Companies, and shareholder litigation against us or our directors and officers, may be referred to binding arbitration.\nA number of our contracts with our Founders, RMR Trust and our Client Companies provide that any dispute arising under those contracts may be referred to binding arbitration. As a result, we and our shareholders may not be able to pursue litigation for these disputes in courts against our Founders, Client Companies, directors or officers. In addition, the ability to collect attorneys\u2019 fees or other damages may be limited in the arbitration, which may discourage attorneys from agreeing to represent parties wishing to commence such a proceeding.\nRMR Inc. is required to pay RMR Trust for certain tax benefits it claims as a result of the tax basis step up we receive as part of the Up-C Transaction and future redemptions by RMR Trust for Class A Common Shares or for cash. In certain circumstances, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual tax benefits RMR Inc. realizes.\nIn the Up-C Transaction, RMR Inc. purchased class A membership units from RMR Trust. In the future, additional class A membership units may be redeemed by RMR Trust for Class A Common Shares or cash. See \u201cBusiness-Our Organizational Structure-The LLC Operating Agreement-Redemption rights of holders of class A membership units.\u201d Both the initial purchase and these additional redemptions may result in increases in our tax basis of our assets that otherwise would not have been available. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we otherwise would be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. The IRS may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases, and a court might sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with RMR Trust that provides for the payment by RMR Inc. to RMR Trust of 85.0% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that RMR Inc. actually realizes as a result of (a) the increases in tax basis attributable to its dealings with RMR Trust and (b) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. See \u201cBusiness-Organizational Structure-Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions, the price of our Class A Common Shares at the time of the redemption, the\nextent to which such redemptions are taxable, and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that, as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of RMR LLC attributable to RMR Inc.\u2019s interests in RMR LLC, during the expected term of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the payments that RMR Inc. makes to RMR Trust may be substantial.\nRMR Trust generally will not reimburse RMR Inc. for any payments that may have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances RMR Inc. could make payments to RMR Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of cash tax savings. Our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing and amount of our future income.\nIn addition, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain changes of control and certain breaches of the agreement that we fail to cure in accordance with the terms of the agreement, our obligations with respect to class A membership units will be accelerated. In those circumstances, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits described in the Tax Receivable Agreement, and that any class A membership units that have not been redeemed will be deemed redeemed for the market value of the Class A Common Shares at the time of the change of control or breach, as applicable. Consequently, it is possible, in these circumstances, that the actual cash tax savings realized by RMR Inc. may be significantly less than the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments.\nOur governing documents permit our directors and officers, our Client Companies and RMR Trust to retain corporate opportunities for their own benefit.\nUnder RMR Inc.\u2019s governing documents and RMR LLC\u2019s operating agreement, no director or officer of ours who is also serving as an officer, employee or agent of a Client Company, RMR Trust or any of RMR Trust\u2019s affiliates is required to present, communicate or offer any business opportunity to us, and that such person shall have the right to hold any business opportunity for themselves or transfer it to any other person to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. If any of these persons fail to present an opportunity to us or takes the opportunity for themselves, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law they will not be liable to us. We have renounced all potential interest or expectation in certain business opportunities which may fit our growth objectives in the future or otherwise have value to us. These opportunities may be directed to the Client Companies or other persons or entities with which we have no relationship. Additionally, under our governing documents, our directors, officers, employees and agents are permitted to engage in other business activities that are similar to, or even competitive with, our own. If such persons engage in competitive business activities, we may have no remedy under our governing documents in these circumstances.\nOur governing documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses and doing so may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nOur governing documents do not limit our business to the management of commercial real estate assets or businesses related thereto. Accordingly, we may pursue other business initiatives. To the extent we enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with: (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities competently or profitably; (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls; and (iv) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures or partnerships, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nOur only material asset is our interest in RMR LLC and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from RMR LLC to pay our taxes and expenses.\nRMR Inc. is organized as a holding company of RMR LLC and its only material assets are its limited liability company membership units of RMR LLC. RMR Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Pursuant to the agreements RMR Inc. entered into with RMR LLC in the Up-C Transaction, RMR Inc., as the managing member of RMR LLC, intends to cause RMR LLC to make distributions in an amount that is at least sufficient to cover applicable taxes payable by its members, other expenses and dividends, if any, declared by us.\nDeterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of RMR LLC for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay such distributions to us. Additionally, to the extent that RMR Inc. requires funds and RMR LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of financing or other arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 15853, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "RMR"}
