RISK FACTORS\nAll of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could, in the future, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Reportable Segments\nChanges in capital markets, M&A activity and legal or regulatory requirements, general economic conditions, and monetary or political disruptions, as well as other factors beyond our control, could reduce demand for practice offerings or services, in which case our revenues and profitability could decline.\nA number of factors outside of our control affect demand for our services. These include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in U.S. and global economies in general and the strength and rate of any general economic recovery from the economic recessions experienced by the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. or global financial markets and the availability, costs and terms of credit;\n\u2022\nthe level of leverage incurred by countries or businesses;\n\u2022\nM&A activity;\n\u2022\nover-expansion by businesses causing financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nbusiness and management crises;\n\u2022\nnew and complex laws and regulations or changes of enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nother economic and geographic factors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral business conditions.\nOur Corporate Finance/Restructuring segment provides various restructuring and restructuring-related services to companies in financial distress or their creditors or other stakeholders. Our Corporate Finance/Restructuring segment has experienced declines of revenues derived from restructuring (including bankruptcy) engagements. Reductions in M&A and capital markets transactions also negatively affect certain practice offerings of our Corporate Finance/Restructuring segment.\nFactors outside of our control also drive demand for the services of our other reportable segments. For example, decreases in litigation filings, class-action suits and regulatory investigations and settlements of proceedings adversely affect our Forensic and Litigation Consulting, Economic Consulting and Technology segments. Our Strategic Communications segment continues to be negatively impacted by fewer M&A transactions, capital markets transactions and public stock offerings, and client decisions to reduce, postpone or curtail discretionary spending, resulting in fewer or lower fee retainer engagements and competitors with lower pricing models.\nWe are not able to predict the positive or negative effects that future events or changes to the U.S. or global economies. Fluctuations, changes and disruptions in financial, credit, M&A and other markets, political instability, and general business factors will impact our operations. Changes to any of the factors described above, as well as other events, including by way of example, contractions of world economies, and monetary systems, banking, real estate and retail or other industries, credit defaults by businesses and countries; new or changes to legislation laws and regulations, including changes to the bankruptcy code; tort reform; banking reform; or a decline in government enforcement, litigation or monetary damages or remedies that are sought, and political instability may have adverse effects on one or more of our segments, industries or practices.\nOur revenues, operating income and cash flows are likely to fluctuate.\nWe experience fluctuations in our revenues, cost structure and the resulting operating income and cash flows and expect that this will continue to occur in the future. We experience fluctuations in our annual or quarterly financial results, including revenues, operating income and earnings per share for reasons that include the number, size, timing and duration of client assignments, utilization of revenue-generating professionals, the types of assignments we are working on at different times, the geographic locations of our clients or where the services are rendered, billing rates and other fee arrangements, the length of billing and collection cycles, new hiring, business and asset acquisitions, and economic factors beyond our control. Our profitability is likely to decline if we experience declines in the number, size or duration or delays to the timing of client assignments, the utilization rates of our professionals or less profitable fee arrangements or discounting of fees. Our results are subject to seasonal and similar factors, especially during the fourth quarter when substantial numbers of our professionals and our clients take vacations. We may also experience fluctuations in our operating income and related cash flows because of increases in employee compensation, including changes to our incentive compensation structure and the timing of incentive payments, which we generally pay during the first quarter of each year, or hiring or retention payments which are paid throughout the year. Also, the timing of future acquisitions and investments and the cost of integrating them may cause fluctuations in our operating income and cash flows.\nWe may not have sufficient shares of our common stock available under our stockholder-approved equity compensation plans to fund our current equity compensation obligations to our SMDs under the ICP, our voluntary deferred bonus plan, our executive officers under the our annual incentive and long-term incentive compensation programs, future compensation arrangements with our officers and employees, or our outside directors through their annual equity compensation awards. We also may not have sufficient shares available for awards to our employees and individual service providers for hiring and retention purposes. We may not receive the approval of our stockholders to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for equity compensation awards. If we fail to obtain stockholder approval, our ICP and other key professional incentive programs, executive officer and outside director compensation programs, and voluntary deferred bonus plan for our SMDs provide that the value of the awards will be paid out in cash or forgivable loans. In such case, we would use a greater percentage of our cash flow for incentive, retention and hiring payments, which would reduce the cash flow available for other purposes.\nIf we do not effectively manage the utilization of our professionals or billable rates our financial results could decline.\nOur failure to manage the utilization of our professionals who bill on an hourly basis or maintain or increase the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services, could result in adverse consequences, such as non- or lower-revenue-generating professionals, increased employee turn-over, fixed compensation expenses in periods of declining revenues, the inability to appropriately staff engagements, or special charges associated with reductions in staff or operations. Reductions in workforce or increases of billable rates will not necessarily lead to savings. In such event, our financial results may decline or be adversely impacted. A number of factors affect the utilization of our professionals. Some of these factors we cannot predict with certainty, including general economic and financial market conditions, the number, type, size and timing of client engagements, the level of demand for our services, appropriate professional staffing levels in light of changing client demands, utilization of professionals across segments and geographic regions, acquisitions, and staff vacations.\nOur segments may enter into engagements on a fixed-fee basis. Failure to effectively manage professional hours and other aspects of fixed-fee engagements may result in the costs of providing such services exceeding the fees collected by the Company. Failure to successfully complete or reach milestones with respect to contingent fee or success fee assignments may also lead to less revenue or the costs of providing services under those types of arrangements exceeding the fees collected by the Company.\nFactors that could negatively affect utilization in our Corporate Finance/Restructuring segment include the completion of bankruptcy proceedings, the timing of the completion of engagements, fewer and smaller restructuring (including bankruptcy) cases, a recovering or strong economy, easy credit availability, low interest rates and fewer, smaller and less complex M&A or less capital markets activity. Factors that could negatively affect utilization in our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment include the settlement of litigation, fewer and less complex legal disputes, fewer class action suits, the timing of the completion of engagements, less government regulation or fewer regulatory investigations and the timing of government investigations and litigation. Factors that could adversely affect utilization in our Economic Consulting segment include fewer or smaller M&A or less capital markets activity or fewer complex transactions, a reduced number of regulatory filings and less litigation, reduced antitrust and competition regulation or enforcement, fewer government investigations and proceedings and timing of client utilization of our services. Our global expansion into or within locations where we are not well known or where demand for our services is not well developed could also contribute to low or lower utilization rates in certain locations. Our Technology segment derives revenue from consulting services, e-discovery services, licensing fees and the amount of data hosted for a client. Factors that could adversely affect our Technology segment\u2019s utilization include the settlement of litigation and a decline in and less complex litigation proceedings and governmental investigations. Our Strategic Communications segment derives revenues from fixed fee and retainer based contracts. Factors that could adversely affect our Strategic Communications segment\u2019s utilization include a decline in M&A or capital markets activity, fewer event driven crises affecting businesses, fewer public securities offerings and general economic decline that may reduce certain discretionary spending by clients.\nOur segments may face risks of fee non-payment, clients may seek to renegotiate existing fees and contract arrangements, and clients may not accept billable rate or price increases, which could result in loss of clients, fee write-offs, reduced revenues and less profitable business.\nOur segments are engaged by certain clients who are experiencing or anticipate experiencing financial distress or are facing complex challenges that could result in financial liabilities. This may be true in light of general economic conditions, or lingering effects of past economic slowdowns or recession. Such clients may not have sufficient funds to continue operations or to pay for our services. We typically do not receive retainers before we begin performing services on a client\u2019s behalf in connection with a significant number of engagements in our segments. In the cases where we have received retainers, we cannot assure the retainers will adequately cover our fees for the services we perform on behalf of these clients. With respect to bankruptcy cases, bankruptcy courts have the discretion to require us to return all, or a portion of, our fees.\nWe have received requests to discount our fees or to negotiate lower rates for our services and to agree to contract terms relative to the scope of services and other terms that may limit the size of an engagement or our ability to pass through costs. We consider these requests on a case-by-case basis. We have been receiving these types of requests and negotiations more frequently and expect this to continue in the future. In addition, our clients and prospective clients may not accept rate increases that we put into effect or plan to implement in the future. Fee discounts, pressure to not increase or even decrease our rates and less advantageous contract terms, could result in the loss of clients, lower revenues and operating income, higher costs and less profitable engagements. More discounts or write-offs than we expect in any period would have a negative impact on our results of operations. There is no assurance that significant client engagements will be renewed or replaced in a timely manner or if at all, or that client engagements will generate the same volume of work or revenues, and be as profitable as past engagements. In addition, certain of our segments have been experiencing more competitive downward fee pressures.\nThe clients of certain of our sub-practices prefer fixed and other alternative fee arrangements that place cost ceilings or other limitations on our fee structure or may shift more of our revenue generating potential to back end \u201csuccess fee\u201d or contingent arrangements. With respect to such alternative arrangements, we may discount our rates initially, which could mean that the cost of providing services exceeds the fees collected by the Company during the term of the engagement. In such cases, the Company\u2019s failure to manage the engagement\nefficiently or collect the success or performance fees could expose the Company to a greater risk of loss on such engagement than other fee arrangements, or may cause variations in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance-based criteria, if achieved at all. Our segment\u2019s ability to service clients with these fee arrangements at a cost that does not directly correlate to time and materials may negatively impact or result in a loss of the profitability of such engagement, adversely affecting the financial results of the segment. In addition, our Technology segment has experienced competition from larger companies providing similar services and other competitors who offer competing services at lower costs.\nOur Technology segment faces certain risks, including the risk that (i) its proprietary software products may be subject to technological changes and obsolescence, which would make it more difficult for us to compete or make our products obsolete and (ii) we may not effectively protect the intellectual property used by that segment.\nThe success of our technology business and its ability to compete depends, in part, upon our technology and other intellectual property, including our proprietary Ringtail\u00ae software, Acuity\u00ae e-discovery offering and other proprietary information and intellectual property rights. The software and products of our Technology segment are subject to rapid technological innovation. There is no assurance that we will successfully develop new versions of our Ringtail\u00ae software or other products. Our software may not keep pace with industry changes and innovation. There is no assurance that new, innovative or improved software or products will be developed, compete effectively with the software and technology developed and offered by competitors, or be accepted by our clients or the marketplace. If our Technology segment is unable to develop and offer competitive software and products or is otherwise unable to capitalize on market opportunities, the revenues, net income and other financial results and growth of the Technology segment and the Company could decline.\nWe rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our assets. Our Ringtail\u00ae software and related documentation are protected principally under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection, and the laws of some foreign jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the U.S. Certain aspects of our Technology segment software are protected by patents granted in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the legal remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use.\nWe may not manage our growth effectively and our profitability may suffer.\nWe experience fluctuations in growth of various operating segments with periods of rapid or declining growth. Periods of rapid expansion of our business may strain our management team, or human resources and information systems. To manage growth successfully, we may need to add qualified managers and employees and periodically update our operating, financial and other systems, as well as our internal procedures and controls. We also must effectively motivate, train and manage a larger professional staff. We cannot assure that we can successfully manage the integration of the companies and assets we acquire or that they will result in the financial, operational and other benefits that we anticipate. Some acquisitions may not be immediately accretive to earnings and some expansion may result in significant expenditures, which may adversely affect profitability in the near term. If we fail to add qualified managers, employees and contractors, estimate costs or manage our growth effectively, our business, financial results and financial condition may be harmed.\nIn periods of declining growth, underutilized employees and contractors may result in expenses and costs being a greater percentage of revenues. In such situations, we will have to weigh the benefits of decreasing our workforce or limiting our service offerings and saving costs against the detriment that the Company could experience from losing valued professionals and their industry expertise and clients.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur international operations involve special risks.\nPrimarily as a result of acquisitions, we operate in 25 countries in addition to the U.S. We expect to continue our international expansion, and our international revenues are expected to account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2014, operations outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 28% of our total revenues, 60% of revenue generated by our Strategic Communications segment, 34% of revenue generated by our Corporate Finance/Restructuring segment, 26% of revenue generated by our Economic Consulting segment, 22% of revenue generated by our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment, and 15% of revenue generated by our Technology consulting segment.\nOur international operations involve financial and business risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our U.S. operations, including:\n\u2022\ncultural and language differences;\n\u2022\nlimited \u201cbrand\u201d recognition;\n\u2022\ndifferent employment laws and rules, employment or service contracts, compensation methods, and social and cultural factors that could result in employee turnover, lower utilization rates, higher costs, and cyclical fluctuations in utilization, that could adversely affect financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nforeign currency disruptions and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies that could adversely affect financial and operating results;\n\u2022\ndifferent legal and regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties in resolving the collection of receivables when legal proceedings are necessary;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties in managing our non-U.S. operations, including client relationships, in certain locations;\n\u2022\ndisparate systems, policies, procedures and processes;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the FCPA and anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nhigher operating costs;\n\u2022\nlonger sales and/or payment cycles;\n\u2022\nrestrictions or adverse tax consequences for the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, such as trapped foreign losses and importation or withholding taxes;\n\u2022\ndifferent or less stable political and/or economic environments; and\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity.\nIf we are not able to quickly adapt to or effectively manage our operations in geographic markets outside of the U.S., our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFailure to comply with governmental, regulatory and legal requirements or with our company-wide Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy, Policy on Inside Information and Insider Trading, and other policies could lead to governmental or legal proceedings that could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe have a robust Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy and Policy on Inside Information and Insider Trading and other policies and procedures that are designed to educate and establish the standards of conduct that we expect from our executive officers, outside directors, employees and independent\ncontractors. These policies require strict compliance with U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those laws and regulations prohibiting improper payments to government officials. In addition, as a corporation whose securities are registered under the Securities Act and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, our executive officers, outside directors, employees and independent contractors are required to comply with the prohibitions against insider trading of our securities. In addition, we impose restrictions on the trading of securities of our clients. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our policies, procedures and related training programs will ensure full compliance with all applicable legal requirements. Illegal or improper conduct by our executive officers, directors, employees, independent contractors or others who are subject to our policies could damage our reputation in the U.S. and internationally or lead to litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary awards, fines and penalties, as well as disgorgement of profits.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. We caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates.\nWe may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges, which could materially affect our financial results.\nWe assess our goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets as well as our other long-lived assets as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, to record appropriate impairment charges. Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. In the fourth quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2013, we recorded impairment charges to the carrying value of goodwill of our Strategic Communications segment of $110.4 million and $83.8 million, respectively. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future relating to that or other segments. Such charges have had and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our People\nOur failure to recruit and retain qualified professionals could negatively affect our financial results and our ability to staff client engagements, maintain relationships with clients and drive future growth.\nWe deliver sophisticated professional services to our clients. To attract and retain clients, we need to demonstrate professional acumen and build trust and strong relationships. Our professionals have highly specialized skills. They also develop strong bonds with the clients they serve. Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professionals who have expertise, reputations and client relationships critical to maintaining and developing our business. We face intense competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals to drive our organic growth and support expansion of our services and geographic footprint. We cannot assure that we will be able to attract and retain qualified professionals to maintain or expand our business. Moreover, competition has caused our costs of retaining and hiring qualified professionals to increase, a trend which could continue and could adversely affect our operating margins and financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had written employment arrangements with substantially all of our 444 SMDs, 255 of which are employment agreements with fixed terms ending between 2014 and 2024 while the other 189 contracts are of an at-will nature with no fixed term. Of the 255 written agreements with a fixed term, 245 provide that at the end of the initial term they automatically renew for successive year-to-year terms, unless either party provides advance written notice of non-renewal prior to commencement of the renewal term.\nDespite the renewal provisions, we could face retention issues at the end of the terms of those agreements and large compensation expenses to secure extensions. There is no assurance we will enter into new or extend employment agreements with SMDs, although that is our intention. We monitor contract expirations carefully to commence dialogues with professionals regarding their employment in advance of the actual contract expiration dates. Our goal is to renew employment agreements when advisable and to stagger the expirations of the agreements if possible. Because of the concentration of contract expirations in certain years, we may experience high turnover or other adverse consequences, such as higher costs, loss of clients and engagements or difficulty staffing engagements, if we are unable to renegotiate employment arrangements or the costs of retaining qualified professionals become higher. The adoption or new compensation arrangements may result in the concentration of potential turnover in future years.\nWe incur substantial costs to hire and retain our professionals and we expect these costs to continue and grow.\nWe provide unsecured general recourse forgivable loans and grant stock option, restricted stock, cash-based stock appreciation rights and other equity- and cash-based awards to attract and retain our professional employees. We make forgivable loans to ICP participants and may provide forgivable or other types of loans to new hires and professionals who join us in connection with acquisitions as well as to select current employees and other professionals on a case-by-case basis. The amounts of loans are significant. Some or all of the principal amount and accrued interest of the loans we make to employees will be forgiven by us upon the passage of time, provided that the professional is an employee on the forgiveness date, and upon other specified events, such as death, disability, termination by us without cause, termination by the employee with good reason or retirement or contract non-renewal, as may be applicable to the relevant employment agreement or loan grant. We expect to continue issuing significant amounts of unsecured general recourse forgivable loans.\nWe also provide significant additional payments under the ICP and other compensation programs in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock- or cash-based awards or, alternatively, cash or forgivable loans if we do not have adequate equity securities available under stockholder-approved equity plans. Our ICP, other compensation programs and certain employment agreements contemplate recurring annual payments, loans or equity- or cash-based awards.\nIn addition, our Economic Consulting segment has contracts with select economists or professionals that provide for compensation equal to such individual\u2019s annual collected client fees plus a percentage of the annual fees generated by junior professionals working on engagements managed by such professionals, which results in compensation expense for that segment being a higher percentage of revenues and EBITDA than the compensation paid by other segments. We expect that these arrangements will continue and that the Company may enter into similar arrangements with other economists and professionals hired by the Company.\nWe rely heavily on our executive officers and the heads of our operating segments and industry leaders for the success of our business.\nWe rely heavily on our executive officers, the heads of our operating segments and our industry leaders to manage our operations. Given the highly specialized nature of our services and the scale of our operations, our executive officers and the heads of our operating segments and industry leaders must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization in diverse geographic locations. We are unable to predict with certainty the impact that leadership transitions may have on our business operations, prospects, financial results, client relationships or employee retention or morale.\nProfessionals may leave our company to form or join competitors and we may not have, or may choose not to pursue, legal recourse against such professionals.\nOur professionals typically have close relationships with the clients they serve, based on their expertise and bonds of personal trust and confidence. Therefore, the barriers to our professionals pursuing independent\nbusiness opportunities or joining our competitors should be considered low. Although our clients generally contract for services with us as a company, and not with individual professionals, in the event that professionals leave, such clients may decide that they prefer to continue working with a professional rather than with our Company. Substantially all of our written employment arrangements with our SMDs include non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. These restrictions have generally been drafted to comply with state \u201creasonableness\u201d standards. However, states generally interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees. Therefore, a state may hold certain restrictions on competition to be unenforceable. In the case of employees outside of the U.S., we draft non-competition provisions in an effort to comply with applicable foreign law. In the event an employee departs and acts in a way that we believe violates his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement, we will consider any legal remedies we may have against such person on a case-by-case basis. We may decide that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with the former employee or client, or other concerns, outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recourse. We may also decide that the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy. Therefore, we may decide not to pursue legal action, even if it is available to us.\nRisks Related to Our Client Relationships\nIf we are unable to accept client engagements due to real or perceived relationship issues, our revenues, growth, client engagements and prospects may be negatively affected.\nOur inability to accept engagements from existing or prospective clients, represent multiple clients in connection with the same or competitive engagements, or any requirement that we resign from a client engagement may negatively impact our revenues, growth and financial results. While we follow internal practices to assess real and potential issues in the relationships between and among our clients, engagements, practices and professionals, such concerns cannot always be avoided. For example, we generally will not represent parties adverse to each other in the same matter. Under federal bankruptcy rules, we generally may not represent both a debtor and its creditors in the same proceeding, and we are required to notify the U.S. Trustee of real or potential conflicts. Even if we begin a bankruptcy-related engagement, the U.S. Trustee could find that we no longer meet the disinterestedness standard because of real or potential changes in our status as a disinterested party, and order us to resign, which could result in disgorgement of fees. Acquisitions may require us to resign from a client engagement because of relationship issues that are not currently identifiable. In addition, businesses that we acquire or employees who join us may not be free to accept engagements they could have accepted prior to our acquisition or hire because of relationship issues.\nClaims involving our services could harm our overall professional reputation and our ability to compete and attract business or hire or retain qualified professionals.\nOur engagements involve matters that may result in a severe impact on a client\u2019s business, cause the client a substantial monetary loss or prevent the client from pursuing business opportunities. Our ability to attract new clients and generate new and repeat engagements or hire professionals depends upon our ability to maintain a high degree of client satisfaction as well as our reputation among industry professionals. As a result, any claims against us involving the quality of our services may be more damaging than similar claims against businesses in other industries.\nWe may incur significant costs and may lose engagements as a result of claims by our clients regarding our services.\nMany of our engagements involve complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment, including litigation and governmental investigatory matters where we act as experts. Therefore, we are subject to the risk of professional liability. Although we believe we maintain an appropriate amount of liability insurance, it is limited. Damages and/or expenses resulting from any successful claims against us, for indemnity or otherwise, in excess of the amount of insurance coverage we maintain, would have to be borne directly by us and could harm our\nprofitability and financial resources. Any claim by a client or a third party against us could expose us to professional or other liabilities in excess of the amount of our insurance limits as well as reputational issues that adversely affect our ability to attract new or maintain existing engagements or clients or qualified professionals or other employees or contractors.\nOur clients may terminate our engagements with little or no notice and without penalty, which may result in unexpected declines in our utilization and revenues.\nOur engagements center on transactions, disputes, litigation and other event-driven occurrences that require independent analysis or expert services. Transactions may be postponed or cancelled, litigation may be settled or be dismissed, and disputes may be resolved, in each case with little or no prior notice to us. If we cannot manage our backlog, our professionals may be underutilized until we can reassign them or obtain new engagements, which can adversely affect financial results.\nThe engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services. Typically, our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time without penalties. In addition, our business involves large client engagements that we staff with a substantial number of professionals. At any time, one or more client engagements may represent a significant portion of a segment\u2019s revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, one client of our Technology segment accounted for approximately 25% of that segment\u2019s annual revenues. If we are unable to replace clients or revenues as engagements end, clients unexpectedly cancel engagements with us or curtail the scope of our engagements, and we are unable to replace the revenues from those engagements, eliminate the costs associated with those engagements or find other engagements to utilize our professionals, the financial results and profitability of a segment or the Company could be adversely affected.\nWe may not have, or may choose not to pursue, legal remedies against clients who terminate their engagements.\nThe engagement letters that we typically have with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services and permit them to terminate the engagement without penalty at any time. Even if the termination of an ongoing engagement by a client could constitute a breach of the client\u2019s engagement agreement, we may decide that preserving the overall client relationship is more important than seeking damages for the breach, and for that or other reasons, decide not to pursue any legal remedies against a client, even though such remedies may be available to us. We make the determination whether to pursue any legal actions against a client on a case-by-case basis.\nFailures of our internal information technology systems controls or compromise of confidential client or company information could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur reputation for providing secure information storage and maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential and trade secret information is critical to the success of our businesses, especially our Technology segment which hosts client information as a service. We routinely face cyber-based attacks and attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to or corrupt our information technology systems, which so far have been unsuccessful. Such attacks could disrupt our business operations, cause us to incur unanticipated losses and result in unauthorized disclosures of confidential or proprietary information. We expect to continue to face such attempts. Although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these network security incidents and have taken steps to mitigate the likelihood of network security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security measures will be effective.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s own confidential and proprietary information and that of our clients could be compromised, whether intentionally or unintentionally, by our employees, consultants or vendors. A successful\nbreach and compromise of the security of our information technology systems leading to theft or misuse of our own or our clients\u2019 proprietary or confidential information, or the public disclosure or use of such information by others, could result in losses, third party claims against us and reputational harm, including the loss of clients.\nIf our reputation is damaged due to a data security breach or theft or compromise of confidential or proprietary information, our ability to attract new engagements and clients may be impaired or we may be subjected to damages or penalties, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernmental focus on data privacy and security could increase our costs of operations.\nIn reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored personal and other information has been lost, accessed or stolen, or transmitted by or to third parties without permission, many states and federal governmental authorities have adopted, proposed or are considering adopting or proposing, data security and/or data privacy statutes or regulations. In addition, many non-U.S. jurisdictions have data privacy and data access laws applicable to personal and other information. Continued governmental focus on data security and privacy may lead to additional legislative and regulatory action, which could increase the complexity of doing business. The increased emphasis on information security and the requirements to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign data security and privacy laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business and negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Competition\nIf we fail to compete effectively, we may miss new business opportunities or lose existing clients and our revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe market for some of our consulting services is highly competitive. We do not compete against the same companies across all of our segments, practices, services, industries or geographic regions. Instead we compete with different companies or businesses of companies depending on the particular nature of a proposed engagement and the types of requested service(s) and the location of the client or delivery of the service(s). Our operations are highly competitive. Our competitors include large organizations, such as the global accounting firms and the large management and financial consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services, investment banking firms, IT consulting and software companies, which offer niche services that are the same or similar to services or products offered by one or more of our segments, and small firms and independent contractors that focus on specialized services. Some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources, a larger national or international presence, larger professional staffs and greater brand recognition than we do. Some have lower overhead and other costs and can compete through lower cost service offerings. Since our business depends in large part on professional relationships, our business has low barriers of entry for professionals electing to start their own firms or work independently. In addition, it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers. If we cannot compete effectively with our competitors or if the costs of competing, including the costs of retaining and hiring professionals, become too expensive, our revenue growth and financial results may differ materially from our expectations.\nWe may face competition from parties who sell us their businesses and from professionals who cease working for us.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we generally obtain non-solicitation agreements from the professionals we hire, as well as non-competition agreements from senior managers and professionals. The agreements prohibit such individuals from competing with us during the term of their employment and for a fixed period afterwards and seeking to solicit our employees or clients. In some cases, but not all, we may obtain non-competition or non-solicitation agreements from parties who sell us their business or assets. The duration of post-employment\nnon-competition and non-solicitation agreements typically range from six- to 12-months. Non-competition agreements with the sellers of businesses or assets that we acquire typically continue longer than 12-months. Certain activities may be carved out of or otherwise may not be prohibited by these arrangements. We cannot assure that one or more of the parties from whom we acquire assets or a business or who do not join us or leave our employment will not compete with us or solicit our employees or clients in the future. States and foreign jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees. Therefore, certain restrictions on competition or solicitation may be unenforceable. In addition, we may not pursue legal remedies if we determine that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with the former employee or his clients, or other concerns, outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recourse or the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy. Such persons, because they have worked for our Company or a business that we acquire, may be able to compete more effectively with us, or be more successful in soliciting our employees and clients, than unaffiliated third parties.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions\nWe may have difficulty integrating our acquisitions or convincing clients to allow assignment of their engagements to us, which can reduce the benefits we receive from acquisitions.\nA substantial amount of our growth has resulted from acquisitions. The process of managing and integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial, operational and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the operation, development and organic expansion of our existing operations. To the extent that we misjudge our ability to integrate and properly manage acquisitions, we may have difficulty achieving our operating, strategic and financial objectives.\nAcquisitions also may involve a number of special financial, business and operational risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures and management styles;\n\u2022\ndisparate policies and practices;\n\u2022\nclient relationship issues;\n\u2022\ndecreased utilization during the integration process;\n\u2022\nloss of key existing or acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial and administrative systems;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of equity securities, including convertible debt securities, to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of legal liabilities;\n\u2022\nfuture earn-out payments or other price adjustments; and\n\u2022\npotential future write-offs relating to the impairment of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition to the integration challenges mentioned above, our acquisitions of non-U.S. companies offer distinct integration challenges relating to foreign laws and governmental regulations, including tax and employee benefit laws, and other factors relating to operating in countries other than the U.S., which have been discussed above in the discussion regarding the difficulties we may face operating globally.\nAsset transactions may require us to seek client consents to the assignment of their engagements to us or a subsidiary. All clients may not consent to an assignment. In certain cases, such as government contracts and bankruptcy engagements, the consents of clients cannot be solicited until after the acquisition has closed. Further, such engagements may be subject to security clearance requirements or bidding provisions with which we might not be able to comply. There is no assurance that clients of the acquired entity or local, state, federal or foreign governments will agree to novate or assign their contracts to us.\nAn acquisition may not be accretive in the near term or at all.\nTo compete for acquisitions, competitive market conditions may require us to pay prices that represent a higher multiple of revenues or profits. As a result of these competitive dynamics costs of the acquisition or other factors certain acquisitions may not be accretive to our overall financial results.\nWe may have a different system of governance and management from the companies we acquire or their parents, which could cause professionals who join us from acquired companies to leave us.\nOur governance and management practices and policies do not mirror the policies and practices of acquired companies or their parents. In some cases, different management practices and policies may lead to workplace dissatisfaction on the part of professionals who join our Company. Some professionals may choose not to join our Company or leave after joining us. Existing professionals may leave us as well. The loss of key professionals may harm our business and results of operations and cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nDue to fluctuations in our stock price, acquisition candidates may be reluctant to accept shares of our common stock as purchase price consideration, use of our shares as purchase price consideration may be more dilutive, or the owners of certain companies we seek to acquire may insist on stock price guarantees.\nWe may structure acquisitions to pay a portion of the purchase price in shares of our common stock. The number of shares issued as consideration is typically based on an average closing price per share of our common stock for a number of days prior to the closing of such acquisition. We believe that payment in the form of shares of common stock of FTI Consulting, Inc. provides the acquired entity and its principals with a vested interest in the future success of the acquisition and the Company. Stock market volatility, generally, or FTI Consulting, Inc.\u2019s stock price volatility, specifically, may result in acquisition candidates being reluctant to accept our shares as consideration. In such cases, we may have to issue more shares, if stock constitutes part of the consideration, pay the entire purchase price in cash, or negotiate an alternative price structure. The result may be an increase in the cost of an acquisition.\nCertain past acquisition related agreements have contained stock price guarantees that resulted in cash payments in the future if the price per share of FTI Consulting, Inc. common stock fell below a specified per share market value on the date restrictions lapse. There is no assurance that an acquisition candidate will not negotiate stock price guarantees, with respect to a future acquisition, which may increase the costs of such acquisition.\nIf we are unable to take advantage of opportunistic acquisition situations, our ability to expand our business may be slowed or curtailed.\nIf the competition for acquisitions increases, or if the cost of acquiring businesses or assets becomes too expensive, the number of suitable acquisition opportunities may decline, the cost of making an acquisition may increase or we may be forced to agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire. Alternatively, at the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself, internal and external pressures (including, but not limited to, borrowing capacity under our senior secured bank credit facility or the availability of alternative financing), may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition. Our ability to grow our business, particularly through acquisitions, may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to grow our business or expand our client offerings as quickly as we have in the past or as we currently plan.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur leverage could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding Notes, Senior Bank Credit Facility and other outstanding indebtedness.\nOur total consolidated long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $711.0 million under our senior notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) and senior notes due 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes,\u201d together with the 2020 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d) and we have $348.6 million of undrawn availability under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility entered into in November 2012 (our \u201cSenior Bank Credit Facility\u201d).\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the notes or our other outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the indenture governing the notes and our other outstanding debt agreements, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under our Senior Bank Credit Facility to foreclose on the assets securing such debt;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the Senior Bank Credit Facility;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under our Senior Bank Credit Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the indentures governing Notes and our Senior Bank Credit Facility, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness. In addition, the indentures that govern the Notes will allow us to issue additional indebtedness under certain circumstances which may also be guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes and the Senior Bank Credit Facility. The indentures for the Notes also allow us to incur certain other additional secured debt, which would be effectively senior to the Notes. In addition, the indentures for the Notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness may have the effect of reducing the amounts available to pay amounts due with respect to our indebtedness, including the Notes. If we incur new debt or other liabilities, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our payment obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on the future performance of FTI Consulting, Inc. and the performance of its subsidiaries, which will be affected by financial,\nbusiness and economic conditions and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as the general economy, economic conditions in the industries in which we operate and competitive pressures. Our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and to meet our other obligations, including with respect to the Notes. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our Senior Bank Credit Facility and the indentures that govern the Notes, may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt before maturity or as it matures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase. Furthermore, if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook, our debt and equity securities could be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and will be required to be guaranteed by future domestic subsidiaries, including those that join us in connection with acquisitions.\nSubstantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under our Notes and Senior Bank Credit Facility. Future U.S. subsidiaries will be required to provide similar guarantees and, in the case of the Senior Bank Credit Facility, similar security. If we default on any guaranteed indebtedness, our U.S. subsidiaries could be required to make payments under their guarantees, and our senior secured creditors could foreclose on their assets to satisfy unpaid obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Senior Bank Credit Facility will be at variable rates of interest, which expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. An increase in debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could affect our ability to make payments required under the terms of the Senior Bank Credit Facility, Notes or our other indebtedness.\nThe covenants in our Senior Bank Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Senior Bank Credit Facility includes negative covenants that may, subject to exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume or suffer to exist liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume or suffer to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, sale-leasebacks and other asset sales and dispositions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we and our subsidiaries conduct;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmodify the terms of certain indebtedness, including the indentures governing the Notes;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, including the Notes; and\n\u2022\nmake material changes to accounting and reporting practices.\nIn addition, the Senior Bank Credit Facility includes financial covenants that require us (i) not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, (ii) not to exceed a maximum senior secured leverage ratio, and (iii) to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nThe indentures governing the Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions to us from our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in certain sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any restricted subsidiary or enter into merger or consolidation transactions with third parties; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nOperating results below a certain level or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in us being unable to comply with certain debt covenants. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the debt thereunder. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the Notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repurchase Notes upon a change of control.\nThe terms of the Notes will require us to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined under the applicable indentures), in some cases at a premium in excess of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued interest to the date of the purchase. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of Notes and will be required to obtain third party financing to do so. We may not be able to obtain this financing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the occurrence of certain change of control events may constitute an event of default under the terms of our Senior Bank Credit Facility. Such an event of default would entitle the lenders under our Senior Bank Credit Facility to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt to become due and payable.", "PERMNO": 83509, "SIC": 8721, "TIC": "FCN"}
