{"cik": "890926", "company": "RADIAN GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRadian Guaranty may be unable to comply with applicable GSE eligibility requirements, including the final PMIERs, which if adopted in their current proposed form, could negatively impact Radian Guaranty\u2019s expected return on equity, decrease Radian Guaranty\u2019s NIW, and subject Radian Guaranty to extensive and more stringent operational requirements.\nIn order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements. If we are unable to satisfy one or more of these requirements, Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae could restrict Radian Guaranty from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.\nThe current GSE eligibility requirements, which are in the process of being revised, impose financial and capital requirements as well as limitations on the type of risk that may be insured, standards for the diversification of risk, procedures for claims handling, standards for acceptable underwriting practices, and standards for certain reinsurance cessions, among other things. In addition, under the existing GSE eligibility requirements, in order to maintain the highest level of eligibility, mortgage insurers are required to maintain certain specified financial strength ratings from at least two of the rating agencies. Because Radian Guaranty does not meet the financial strength rating requirements specified in the GSEs\u2019 existing eligibility guidelines, Radian Guaranty currently is operating as an eligible insurer under remediation plans with the GSEs that describe how we intend to achieve consistent levels of operating profitability and ultimately regain higher financial strength ratings for Radian Guaranty. We cannot be certain whether, or for how long, either of the GSEs will continue to allow Radian Guaranty to operate as an eligible insurer under our remediation plans.\nThe GSEs are in the process of revising their eligibility requirements for private mortgage insurers. In September 2014, Fannie Mae notified us (and other private mortgage insurers operating under remediation plans), that for the period until the new eligibility requirements are finalized, Fannie Mae would be imposing additional terms and conditions for Radian Guaranty to maintain eligibility as a Fannie Mae approved mortgage insurer. In the event that Radian Guaranty fails to comply with the additional requirements, Fannie Mae may impose further conditions on Radian Guaranty, or may suspend or terminate its status as an eligible insurer. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation - Direct Federal Regulation - GSE Requirements.\u201d\nOn July 10, 2014, the FHFA released proposed PMIERs for public comment. The PMIERs, when finalized and effective, will establish the revised requirements that the GSEs will impose on private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, to remain eligible insurers of mortgage loans purchased by the GSEs. The proposed PMIERs include the PMIERs Financial Requirements that are expected to replace the capital adequacy standards under the current GSE eligibility requirements. The proposed PMIERs Financial Requirements require a mortgage insurer\u2019s Available Assets to meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets, which is an amount that is calculated based on net RIF and a variety of measures designed to evaluate credit quality. Among other things, the proposed PMIERs exclude from Available Assets: (i) an amount equal to Unearned Premium Reserves; and (ii) certain subsidiary capital, including Radian Guaranty\u2019s capital that is attributable to its ownership of Radian Asset Assurance.\nThe public comment period for the proposed PMIERs ended on September 8, 2014. The FHFA is currently reviewing and considering input before adopting the final PMIERs. All aspects of the final PMIERs are expected to become effective 180 days after their final publication. Approved mortgage insurers that fail to meet the PMIERs Financial Requirements when they become effective may, at the GSE\u2019s discretion, operate under a transition plan during an extended transition period of up to two years from the final publication date, and would continue to be eligible insurers during that period. We expect the final PMIERs to be published in the first half of 2015 and to become effective by the end of 2015. Based on an assumed final publication date of June 30, 2015, with an effective date of December 31, 2015, Radian Guaranty\u2019s estimated net shortfall in Available Assets would be approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2015, after giving consideration to existing holding company cash balances of $670 million and approximately $790 million in anticipated proceeds from the pending sale of Radian Asset Assurance. We have derived these estimates independently and without verification from the GSEs. It is possible that the GSEs may apply the PMIERs differently than we have, which could change the size of our projected net shortfall in Available Assets. In order for Radian Guaranty to comply with the PMIERs Financial Requirements as proposed, we expect to contribute a substantial portion of our holding company cash and investments to Radian Guaranty, and also that we will be successful in: (1) completing the pending sale of Radian Asset Assurance to Assured pursuant to the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement; and (2) leveraging other options such as commutations of existing risk or external reinsurance for a portion of our mortgage insurance RIF in a manner that provides capital relief and is compliant with the PMIERs. In the event we are unable to successfully execute these or similar transactions or strategies, or such transactions are not available on terms that are attractive to us, we may seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity, or by selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe amount of capital or capital relief that may be required to comply with the PMIERs also may be impacted by: (1) the performance of our mortgage insurance business, including our level of defaults, the losses we incur on new or existing defaults and the amount and credit characteristics of new business we write, among other factors; and (2) changes in the final PMIERs Financial Requirements from their proposed form that affect the amount of Radian Guaranty\u2019s Minimum Required Assets or its Available Assets.\nAlthough we expect to be able to retain Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs and to be able to comply with the final PMIERs, we cannot provide any assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs would likely have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects and a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAbsent a change in our mortgage insurance pricing, the more onerous financial requirements in the proposed PMIERs for NIW would likely have a negative impact on our returns on equity. Any potential change in our mortgage insurance pricing likely will depend on competition and our evaluation of projected risk-adjusted returns on the business we write, among other factors. An increase in pricing may not be feasible for a number of reasons, including competition from other private mortgage insurers, the FHA or other credit enhancement products.\nThe PMIERs Financial Requirements are most pronounced for delinquent loans, loans written between 2005 and 2008 that have not been refinanced through HARP and loans with higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. As a result, there is a possibility that we may choose to limit the type of business we are willing to write to avoid the increased financial requirements and the higher likelihood of default that are associated with loans with higher LTVs and lower FICO scores. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our revenues.\nThe proposed PMIERs contain requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive and more stringent operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. The requirements in the proposed PMIERs, if adopted in their current form, could require changes to our business practices that may result in substantial additional costs in order to achieve and maintain compliance with the PMIERs.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, including capital adequacy measures, which if we fail to satisfy, could limit our ability to write new insurance and increase restrictions and requirements placed on our insurance subsidiaries.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance departments in each of the states where they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business.\nThe state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries. These include risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that potentially may limit the amount of insurance that our insurance subsidiaries may write. State insurance regulators also possess significant discretion with respect to our insurance subsidiaries. Our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital, among other things, could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition.\nUnder state insurance regulations, Radian Guaranty is required to maintain minimum surplus levels and, in certain states, a minimum ratio of statutory capital relative to the level of net RIF, or \u201crisk-to-capital.\u201d The sixteen RBC States currently impose a Statutory RBC Requirement. The most common Statutory RBC Requirement is that a mortgage insurer\u2019s Risk-to-capital may not exceed 25 to 1. In certain of the RBC States, there is a Statutory RBC Requirement that the mortgage insurer must satisfy a MPP Requirement. The statutory capital requirements for the non-RBC States are de minimis (ranging from $1 million to $5 million); however, the insurance laws of these states generally grant broad supervisory powers to state agencies or officials to enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business. Unless an RBC State grants a waiver or other form of relief, if a mortgage insurer is not in compliance with the Statutory RBC Requirement of such state, that mortgage insurer may be prohibited from writing new mortgage insurance business in that state. Radian Guaranty\u2019s domiciliary state, Pennsylvania, is not one of the RBC States. As of December 31, 2014, Radian Guaranty\u2019s Risk-to-capital, after giving effect to a $100 million capital contribution from Radian Group in February 2015, was 17.9 to 1 and Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements.\nAbsent an increase in capital, including through statutory income, Radian Guaranty\u2019s Risk-to-capital generally increases if we increase our net RIF or if we incur operating losses. With respect to incurred losses, the ultimate amount and timing of any future incurred losses will depend, in part, on general economic conditions and other factors, including the health of credit markets, home prices and unemployment rates, all of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. Our mortgage insurance incurred losses are driven primarily by new mortgage insurance defaults and changes in the assumptions used to determine our loss reserves. Establishing loss reserves in our businesses requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of anticipated losses. If the actual losses we ultimately realize are in excess of the loss estimates we use in establishing loss reserves, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect Radian Guaranty\u2019s statutory capital position.\nWe use reinsurance from affiliated companies to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s risk-to-capital ratio. Certain of these affiliated reinsurance companies have required, and may in the future require, additional capital contributions from Radian Group. If we are limited in, or prohibited from, using these reinsurance arrangements to reduce Radian Guaranty\u2019s risk, including as a result of any new eligibility requirements adopted by the GSEs, it would adversely affect Radian Guaranty\u2019s risk-to-capital position.\nIn addition to the proposed new GSE eligibility guidelines, the NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. While the outcome of this process is not known, it is possible that among other changes, the NAIC will recommend and adopt more stringent capital requirements that could increase the capital requirements for Radian Guaranty in states that adopt the new Model Act.\nIf Radian Guaranty is not in compliance with a state\u2019s applicable Statutory RBC Requirement, it may be prohibited from writing new business in that state until it is back in compliance or it receives a waiver of, or similar relief from, the requirement. In those states that do not have a Statutory RBC Requirement, it is not clear what actions the applicable state regulators would take if a mortgage insurer fails to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement established by another state. Accordingly, if Radian Guaranty were to fail to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement in one or more states, it could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which it does business. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty while its capital position remained at such levels. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business would likely be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states.\nOur existing capital resources may not be sufficient to successfully manage Radian Guaranty\u2019s regulatory capital requirements. See \u201cRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\u201d\nFailure to complete the sale of Radian Asset Assurance pursuant to the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement could negatively impact our business and our financial condition, and could adversely impact Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to comply with the PMIERs Financial Requirements.\nOn December 22, 2014, Radian Guaranty entered into the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement to sell 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Radian Asset Assurance to Assured, for a purchase price of approximately $810 million, subject to certain adjustments. After closing costs and other adjustments, we expect net cash proceeds of approximately $790 million from the sale. The completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval from the state insurance departments of Maryland, New York and California. The Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement also may be terminated by either party, subject to certain conditions, if the sale has not been completed by September 22, 2015. Although we currently expect to complete the sale of Radian Asset Assurance during the first half of 2015, we can provide no assurance that the closing conditions will be satisfied, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, or whether the transaction otherwise will be completed.\nThe sale of Radian Asset Assurance is a critical component of our strategy to accelerate Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to comply with the proposed PMIERs Financial Requirements. Although we expect that the conditions to closing will be satisfied and that the sale of Radian Asset Assurance will be completed pursuant to the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement, there can be no assurance that this will occur. If we are unable to complete the sale of Radian Asset Assurance in time to satisfy the PMIERs Financial Requirements once they become effective, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement an alternative transaction to successfully monetize Radian Asset Assurance or to otherwise utilize the capital in Radian Asset Assurance such that we are provided credit for such capital under the PMIERs Financial Requirements. If we are able to implement an alternative transaction, there can be no assurance that we would receive the same or greater value for Radian Asset Assurance than is provided for under the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement. If we are unable to complete the transaction under the terms of the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement or an alternative transaction, in order to comply with the PMIERs Financial Requirements, we may be required to seek additional capital or capital relief by increasing the amount of reinsurance we are planning to utilize or by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity, or by selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nIn the past, the assets and liabilities associated with the financial guaranty business have been a source of significant volatility to our results of operations due to various factors, including fluctuations in fair value and credit risk. As a result of the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement, we have reclassified the operating results related to the pending disposition of Radian Asset Assurance as discontinued operations. In addition, due to the pending disposition, we are no longer reporting a financial guaranty business segment and we do not expect the financial results of Radian Asset Assurance to have an impact on Radian\u2019s consolidated net income after December 31, 2014. In the event that the sale is not completed and Radian Asset Assurance is no longer classified as held for sale, we would not realize a loss on the sale of Radian Asset Assurance and the financial results of Radian Asset Assurance would have an impact on Radian Group\u2019s consolidated net income. In addition, failure to complete the sale of Radian Asset Assurance pursuant to the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement would likely make it more difficult, and potentially more costly, for Radian Guaranty to comply with the PMIERs Financial Requirements and could negatively impact the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business.\nThe credit performance of our insured portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to satisfy mortgage obligations.\nAs a seller of credit protection, our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the credit performance of our underlying insured assets. Many of these conditions are beyond our control, including national and regional economic conditions, housing prices, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other factors. In general, favorable economic conditions increase the likelihood that borrowers will be able to satisfy their mortgage obligations and also have a positive impact on the value of homes. Conversely, a deterioration in economic conditions generally decreases the likelihood that borrowers will have sufficient income to satisfy their mortgage obligations and can also adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so.\nMortgage defaults also can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, increases in the interest rates of adjustable rate mortgages, changes in regional economic conditions, and housing value changes that cause the outstanding mortgage amount to exceed the value of a home or other events.\nThe financial crisis and the downturn in the U.S. housing and related credit markets that began in 2007 had a significant negative impact on the operating environment and results of operations for our mortgage insurance business. Although there has been continued improvement in the U.S. economy and the operating environment for our mortgage insurance business, the U.S. economy and certain housing markets are still recovering and, in many areas, are still weak compared to historical standards. As a result, it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate loss performance on our insured portfolio. While we expect the economy and housing market will continue to recover and strengthen in 2015 and that our mortgage insurance incurred losses will continue to improve, these expectations are based on factors that are beyond our control, and therefore, we can provide no assurance whether our projections will prove to be accurate.\nIn addition to the factors cited above, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by natural disasters or other catastrophic events, acts of terrorism, war or other severe conflicts, event-specific economic depressions or other harmful events in the regions, including in foreign countries, where we do business or have insured exposure.\nThe length of time that our policies remain in force could decline and result in a decrease in our actual versus projected revenue.\nIn each year, most of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in force, which is also generally referred to as persistency, is a significant determinant of our revenues. The factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:\n\u2022\nthe mortgage interest rates being offered in the market compared to the mortgage rates on our insurance in force, which affects the vulnerability of our insurance in force to refinancings (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);\n\u2022\napplicable policies for mortgage insurance cancellation, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in our insurance in force;\n\u2022\nthe credit policies of lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that can affect a borrower\u2019s decision to pay-off a mortgage earlier than required.\nCurrent mortgage interest rates are at or near historic lows, and therefore, the risk of refinancing remains elevated in today\u2019s mortgage market. Our revenues might be negatively impacted if the length of time that our policies remain in force declines as a result of any of the factors highlighted above.\nOur loss mitigation strategies are less effective during poor economic environments and in weaker housing markets.\nThe amount of mortgage insurance loss we suffer depends in part on the extent to which the home of a borrower who has defaulted on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover the unpaid principal and interest on the mortgage and the expenses of the sale. In the event of a claim under our Master Policies, we generally have the option of paying the entire loss amount and taking title to a mortgaged property or paying our coverage percentage. In the past, during strong housing markets, we were able to take title to properties underlying certain defaulted loans and sell the properties at prices that allowed us to recover some or all of our losses. However, in more recent years, our ability to mitigate our losses in this manner has been significantly reduced. Further, in certain cases and subject to certain conditions, we consent to a sale of the property by the borrower for less than the amount needed to cover the borrower\u2019s mortgage obligation (a \u201cshort sale\u201d), which often has the effect of reducing our ultimate claim payment obligation. Under our Master Policies, we retain the right to consent prior to the consummation of any short sales. However, we have entered into agreements with each of the GSEs (with respect to loans owned by the GSEs) and with certain loan servicers pursuant to which we have delegated to them our prior consent rights with respect to short sales, subject to certain conditions, and as a result, we do not review the transactions effected pursuant to this delegated authority prior to the short sale. If housing values decline on either a broad geographic basis or in the regions where our business is concentrated, the frequency of defaulted loans resulting in claims under our policies could increase and our ability to mitigate our losses on defaulted mortgages through short sales or through the resale of properties we acquire may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect a reduced level of Loss Mitigation Activity with respect to the claims we receive and further Loss Mitigation Activities may negatively impact our relationships with customers.\nFollowing the financial crisis, the amount of insurance we rescinded due to fraud, misrepresentation, underwriting negligence or other non-compliance with our insurance policies increased significantly. Likewise, the number of claims that we denied also increased, primarily due to the inability of our servicing customers to provide the loan origination file or other servicing records that are necessary for our review in order to perfect a claim. These rescissions and denials have materially mitigated our paid losses and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. More recently, our level of Loss Mitigation Activity has been decreasing, although it still remains elevated compared to historical levels.\nIn addition, as part of our claims review process, we assess whether defaulted loans were serviced appropriately in accordance with our insurance policies and servicing guidelines. To the extent a servicer has failed to satisfy its servicing obligations, our policies provide that we may curtail the claim payment for such default, and in some circumstances, cancel coverage or deny the claim. Since 2011, claim curtailments have increased both in frequency and in size, which has contributed to a reduction in the severity of our claim payments during this period. We cannot give assurance regarding the extent or level at which such claim curtailments will continue.\nAs our Legacy Portfolio has become a smaller percentage of our overall insured portfolio, there has been a decrease in the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity with respect to the claims we receive, and we expect this trend to continue. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as in prior years.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities have resulted in disputes with our customers, which has heightened the risk of litigation and in some cases, damaged our relationships with certain customers. While we have resolved many of our disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities could have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers, including the potential loss of business. Further, if ongoing disputes continue and are not resolved, it could result in arbitration or judicial proceedings.\nBecause most of the mortgage loans that we insure are sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, changes in their charters or business practices could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.\nThe GSEs are the beneficiaries of the majority of our mortgage insurance policies. The GSEs\u2019 federal charters generally prohibit them from purchasing any mortgage with a loan amount that exceeds 80% of a home\u2019s value, unless that mortgage is insured by a qualified mortgage insurer, the mortgage seller retains at least a 10% participation in the loan or the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the loan in the event of a default. As a result, high-LTV mortgages purchased by the GSEs generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. Changes in the charters or business practices of either of the GSEs, including as a result of developments in the regulatory environment in which they operate, could reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish our franchise value.\nThe GSEs\u2019 business practices may be impacted by their results of operations, as well as by legislative or regulatory changes governing their operations. In July 2008, an overhaul of regulatory oversight of the GSEs was enacted, and in September 2008, the FHFA was appointed as the conservator of the GSEs to control and direct the operations of the GSEs. The FHFA annually releases a strategic plan for the next phase of the conservatorship. The strategic plan announced for 2015 includes development of a single platform infrastructure for the mortgage market, planned regulations for the treatment of long-delinquent non-performing loans, the PMIERs, review of LLPAs and guarantee fees, efforts to increase the size and diversity of risk share transactions to reduce the role of the GSEs, increasing private sector participation and maintaining liquidity in the mortgage market and general mortgage credit availability. The continued role of the conservator may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs will be changed, and potentially in ways that may have an adverse effect on us.\nWith respect to loans purchased by the GSEs, changes in the business practices of the GSEs which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our mortgage insurance business and financial performance, including:\n\u2022\nimplementation of new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers, including more onerous capital standards (see \u201cRadian Guaranty may be unable to comply with applicable GSE eligibility requirements, including the final PMIERs, which if adopted in their current proposed form, could negatively impact Radian Guaranty\u2019s expected return on equity, decrease Radian Guaranty\u2019s NIW, and subject Radian Guaranty to extensive and more stringent operational requirements.\u201d);\n\u2022\nchanging the underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase;\n\u2022\nestablishing policies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\naltering the national conforming loan limit for mortgages acquired by them;\n\u2022\naltering the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u2022\nchanging the terms required to be included in mortgage insurance policies they acquire;\n\u2022\nrequiring private mortgage insurers to perform specified activities intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are in default;\n\u2022\nchanging the amount of LLPAs or guarantee fees (which may result in a higher cost to borrowers) that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance (see \u201cOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\u201d);\n\u2022\nintervening in mortgage insurers\u2019 rescission practices or settlements with servicers; and\n\u2022\ninfluencing a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nCertain of the GSEs\u2019 programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required, and they have the ability to further reduce coverage requirements, which could reduce the amount of mortgage insurance they purchase from us, and consequently could adversely affect our results of operations. For a number of years, the GSEs have had programs under which lenders could choose, for certain loans, a mortgage insurance coverage percentage that was the minimum required by the GSEs\u2019 charters, with the GSEs paying a lower price for these loans (\u201ccharter coverage\u201d). In 2010, Fannie Mae broadly expanded the types of loans eligible for charter coverage. To the extent lenders selling loans to Fannie Mae choose charter coverage for loans that we insure, our revenues would likely be reduced.\nThe future structure of the residential housing finance system remains uncertain, including the impact of any changes on our business. In February 2011, the Obama Administration released a proposal to reform the U.S. housing finance market. In its proposal, the Obama Administration sought to gradually reduce the federal government\u2019s role in housing finance, including the ultimate wind-down of the GSEs, and to increase the role of private capital. The Obama Administration\u2019s proposal has shaped the debate in Congress as the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee have each introduced and considered legislation to reform the housing finance market. The placement of the GSEs into the conservatorship of the FHFA increases the likelihood that Congress will address the role and purpose of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market, however, it remains unclear whether housing finance reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what form it will ultimately take.\nAlthough we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, new federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminate the requirement, which would reduce our available market and could adversely affect our mortgage insurance business.\nA decrease in the volume of home mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new insurance business and reduce our NIW.\nThe amount of new business we write depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that require our mortgage insurance. Factors that affect the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mortgage credit due to more stringent lender underwriting standards, more restrictive regulatory requirements such as the required ability-to-pay determination prior to extending credit and liquidity issues affecting lenders;\n\u2022\nthe level of home mortgage interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe health of the domestic economy as well as conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nhousing affordability;\n\u2022\npopulation trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u2022\nthe rate of home price appreciation, which can affect whether refinance loans have loan-to-value ratios that require private mortgage insurance;\n\u2022\ngovernment housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the guaranty fees, LLPAs, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect lenders\u2019 willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nIn addition, losses from the financial crisis and housing downturn caused lenders to substantially reduce the availability of these low down payment loans and to significantly tighten their underwriting standards. Fewer loan products and more restrictive loan qualifications, while improving the overall quality of new mortgage originations, have in turn reduced the number of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult for buyers (in particular first-time buyers) to obtain mortgage financing or to refinance their existing mortgages. In addition, the significant disruption in the housing and related credit markets that began in 2007 led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and MBS in the secondary market, which historically has been a source of funding for many mortgage lenders. This significantly reduced liquidity in the mortgage funding marketplace has forced many lenders to retain a larger portion of their mortgage loans and MBS and has left them with less capacity to continue to originate new mortgages.\nTotal domestic mortgage originations have decreased significantly from the $2.7 trillion in 2006 (pre-dating the housing downturn) to approximately $1.2 trillion. If the volume of new mortgage originations continues to remain at low levels for a prolonged period, we will likely experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and will be subject to increased competition with respect to that opportunity, which could reduce the size of our mortgage insurance business and have a significant negative effect on our returns on new business, our ability to execute our business plans and our overall franchise value. See \u201cOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\u201d Further, the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s reforms to strengthen lending standards, improve underwriting standards and increase accountability in the loan origination and securitization processes could further reduce the total number of mortgage originations in the future, in particular with respect to the high-LTV market.\nOur NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers, and in particular, our relationships with our largest lending customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans that they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they do with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.\nDuring 2014, our top 10 mortgage insurance customers (measured by NIW) were generally responsible for 22.9% of our primary NIW in that year. For the past several years we have been focused on expanding and diversifying our customer base. While we have been successful in this initiative, maintaining our business relationships and business volumes with our largest lending customers remains critical to the success of our business.\nIn response to the financial crisis and the related deterioration in housing markets, we tightened our underwriting guidelines, and as a result, we declined to insure some of the loans originated by our larger customers. We also increased our Loss Mitigation Activities to enforce our rights under our mortgage insurance policies with respect to loans originated during a period of historically poor underwriting and a subsequent period of servicing problems that increased our risk of loss. Our more restrictive underwriting guidelines and increased level of Loss Mitigation Activity have negatively affected our relationships with certain of our customers and in some cases have resulted in customers choosing to limit the amount of business they conduct with us or ceasing to do business with us entirely. While we have taken steps to resolve our past disputes with many of our customers, a risk remains that customers will choose to reduce the amount of business they do with us due to our past Loss Mitigation Activities or actions we may take in the future. See \u201cWe expect a reduced level of Loss Mitigation Activity with respect to the claims we receive and further Loss Mitigation Activities may negatively impact our relationships with customers.\u201d\nAlthough we have taken steps to significantly expand and diversify our customer base in recent years, we cannot be certain that any loss of business from significant customers, or any single lender, would be replaced by other customers, existing or new. As a result of current market conditions and increased regulatory requirements, our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Alternatively, in light of the increased number of participants in the private mortgage insurance industry, certain of our customers have chosen for risk management purposes to diversify and expand the number of mortgage insurers with which they do business, which has negatively affected our level of NIW and market share with such customers. Given the amount of business we currently do with many of our customers, it is possible that further diversification could continue, which could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\nThe U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other private mortgage insurers and federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA.\nWe compete with other private mortgage insurers on the basis of price, terms and conditions, customer relationships, reputation, perceived ability to comply with applicable capital and other financial strength requirements (including projected compliance with the PMIERs) and overall service. The improvement in the credit quality of new loans being insured in the current market, combined with the deterioration of the financial positions of many existing private mortgage insurance companies during the financial crisis (which led insurance regulators to take action with respect to certain companies) has brought new entrants to our industry and could encourage additional new competitors. Radian Guaranty currently competes with six other private mortgage insurers eligible to write business for the GSEs. Certain of our private mortgage insurance competitors have stronger financial strength ratings than Radian Guaranty and are subsidiaries of larger corporations that may have greater access to capital and financial resources than we do. In addition, three of our competitors who are new entrants to the industry are not burdened by legacy credit risks. If we are unable to compete with other providers, including new entrants that are not burdened by legacy credit risks or by Loss Mitigation Activities on legacy insurance portfolios, it could have a material adverse effect on our business position, financial condition and operating results.\nWe also compete with governmental and quasi-governmental entities that typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In the event that a government-owned entity in one of our markets decides to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBeginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its share of the mortgage insurance market, including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines, sometimes at a lower monthly cost to the borrower than a loan that carries our mortgage insurance. Since 2010, the private mortgage insurance industry has been recapturing market share from the FHA, primarily due to increases in the financial strength of private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, the development of new products and marketing efforts directed at competing with the FHA, increases in the FHA\u2019s pricing, the Department of Justice\u2019s pursuit of legal remedies against lenders doing business with the FHA, as well as various policy changes at the FHA, such as reversing a past FHA policy that cancelled premiums for mortgage insurance coverage on certain loans once the loans had been paid down below a certain percentage. More recently, in January 2015, the FHA announced a 50 basis point reduction to its annual mortgage insurance premium which may adversely impact our competitiveness on certain high LTV loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 720.\nAlthough the FHA\u2019s market share has been gradually declining, the FHA may continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market position again in the future. Factors that could cause the FHA to maintain or increase its share of the mortgage insurance market include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental policy, including further decreases in the pricing of FHA insurance or changes in the terms of such insurance;\n\u2022\npast and potential future capital constraints of the private mortgage insurance industry;\n\u2022\nthe tightening by private mortgage insurers of underwriting guidelines based on past loan performance or other risk concerns;\n\u2022\nthe increased levels of Loss Mitigation Activity by private mortgage insurers on older vintage portfolios compared to the FHA\u2019s historical practice of engaging in limited Loss Mitigation Activities;\n\u2022\na decrease in the Department of Justice\u2019s pursuit of remedies against lenders doing business with the FHA;\n\u2022\nincreases in the LLPAs charged by the GSEs on loans that require mortgage insurance and changes in the amount of guarantee fees for the loans that the GSEs acquire (which may result in higher cost to borrowers);\n\u2022\nthe perceived operational ease of using FHA insurance compared to the products of private mortgage insurers; and\n\u2022\nthe implementation of new regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III guidelines that may be more favorable to the FHA compared to private mortgage insurers (see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Other Federal Regulation-The Dodd-Frank Act.\u201d and \u201cThe implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance\u201d).\nOne or more private mortgage insurers may seek to regain market share from the FHA or other mortgage insurers by reducing pricing, loosening their underwriting guidelines, or relaxing their loss mitigation practices, which could, in turn, improve their competitive position in the industry and negatively impact our level of NIW. A decline in industry NIW might result in increased competition as certain private mortgage insurance companies may seek to maintain their NIW levels within a smaller market overall. In addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance may develop which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance.\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on reliable, consistent third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing generally ensures timely billing and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans.\nChallenging economic and market conditions following the financial crisis negatively affected the ability of many of our servicers to effectively maintain their servicing operations. In addition, the financial crisis and economic downturn led to a significant increase in the number of delinquent mortgage loans. These increases strained the resources of servicers, reducing their ability to undertake loss mitigation efforts in a timely manner, including the processing of potential loan modifications, which could help limit our losses. Further, due to the strain on the resources of servicers, delinquent loan servicing is increasingly being transferred to specialty servicers. The transfer of servicing can cause a disruption in the servicing of delinquent loans. Additionally, specialty servicers may not have sufficient resources to effectively handle the substantially higher volume of delinquent loans.\nRecent state and federal inquiries and investigations into whether servicers have acted improperly in foreclosure proceedings, including the cost of and conditions imposed in settlements of such inquiries or investigations, have further strained the resources of servicers. In January 2014, the CFPB\u2019s rules establishing national servicing standards for servicing residential mortgage loans became effective. These rules impose new and more burdensome requirements, procedures and standards and complying with the new rules may impact the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies.\nIf a disruption occurs in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies, this, in turn, could contribute to a rise in delinquencies and/or claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLoan modification, refinancing and other similar programs may not continue to provide us with a material benefit.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), the GSEs and various lenders have adopted programs to modify loans to make them more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan to restructure or refinance mortgages to avoid foreclosures through: (1) refinancing mortgage loans through HARP; (2) modifying First- and Second-lien mortgage loans through HAMP and the Second Lien Modification Program; and (3) offering other alternatives to foreclosure through HAFA. For additional information about these loan modification programs and other initiatives, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Direct Federal Regulation.\u201d These programs have benefited the composition and credit quality of our Legacy Portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 10% of our total primary mortgage insurance RIF had successfully completed a HARP refinance.\nWhile modifications continue to be made under these programs, we expect the number of loans remaining in our mortgage insurance portfolio that will successfully complete a HARP refinance or other loan modification to decline. In addition, it is unclear how many successful loan modifications will result from these programs, in particular in light of the high level of re-default rates for loans that have been modified through these programs. To the extent modifications cure previously defaulted loans, our loss reserves do not account for potential re-defaults unless at the time the reserve is established, the re-default has already occurred. The expiration, termination or temporary cessation of any of these programs could result in an increased number of claims in our mortgage insurance business and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe cannot ascertain the total benefits we may derive from these loan modification programs, particularly given the uncertainty around the re-default rates for loans that have been modified through these programs. Re-defaults can result in losses that could be greater than we would have paid had the loan not been modified. If a mortgage balance is reduced as a result of a loan modification program, we may still be responsible under our Master Policies to pay the original balance if the borrower re-defaults on that mortgage after its balance has been reduced.\nThe extended period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory may increase the severity of claims we ultimately are required to pay.\nForeclosure backlogs may delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory, and may increase the severity of claims that we are ultimately required to pay. Over the past several years, the average time it takes to receive a claim associated with a defaulted loan has increased. This is, in part, due to new loss mitigation protocols established by servicers and to a significant backlog of foreclosure proceedings in many states, and especially in those states that impose a judicial process for foreclosures. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the severity of claims we ultimately are required to pay.\nOur success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks.\nThe estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Mortgage Insurance-Premium Rates.\u201d Our mortgage insurance premiums are based on, among other items, the amount of capital we are required to hold against such risks and our long-term expected risk of claims on insured loans and take into account, among other factors, each loan\u2019s LTV, type (e.g., prime vs. non-prime or fixed vs. variable payments), premium structure (e.g., single lump sum, monthly or other variations), term, coverage percentage and whether there is a deductible in front of our loss position. These assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. In particular, the predictive value of historical data may be less reliable during periods of greater economic stress and, accordingly, our ability to correctly estimate our premium requirements may be impaired during periods of economic uncertainty such as we have recently experienced.\nWe generally cannot cancel or elect not to renew the mortgage insurance we provide, and because we generally fix premium rates for the life of a policy when issued, we cannot adjust renewal premiums or otherwise adjust premiums during the life of a policy. Therefore, if the risk underlying many of the mortgage loans we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, including as a result of the ongoing weakness in many parts of the economy and in certain housing markets, and the premiums our customers are currently paying for similar coverage on new business from us and others has increased, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written, as we expect generally will be the case when the PMIERs Financial Requirements become effective, we cannot adjust the premiums to compensate for this, and, as a result, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on increased capital that may be required. See \u201cThe credit performance of our insured portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to satisfy mortgage obligations.\u201d\nOur delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we enter into agreements with our mortgage lender customers that commit us to insure loans made by them using pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a loan originated by that lender even if the lender has not followed our specified underwriting guidelines. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender\u2019s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.\nWe face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.\nWe provide contract underwriting services for certain of our mortgage lender customers, including on loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance. Our contract underwriting program offers a limited indemnification in the event of a material underwriting error. We offer limited indemnification rights for underwriting errors with respect to those loans that we simultaneously underwrite for both secondary market compliance and for potential mortgage insurance eligibility and may, in certain circumstances, offer limited indemnification when we underwrite a loan only for secondary market compliance. See \u201cLegislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\u201d\nOur current credit ratings and the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position.\nRecently, the credit ratings of Radian Group and the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries have been subject to upgrades, reflecting the improvement in our overall financial condition and the operating environment for our business. Notwithstanding these upgrades, however, our ratings remain below investment grade and may be downgraded in the future. The current financial strength ratings for Radian Guaranty are Ba2 by Moody\u2019s and BB- by S&P.\nHistorically, our ratings were critical to our ability to market our products and to maintain our competitive position and customer confidence in our products. In addition, in order to maintain the highest level of eligibility with the GSEs, mortgage insurers historically had to maintain an insurance financial strength rating of AA- or Aa3 from at least two of the three rating agencies by which they are customarily rated. Although Radian Guaranty\u2019s ratings are substantially below those required ratings, the GSEs have allowed Radian Guaranty to operate under business and financial remediation plans and retain its eligibility status. In July 2014, the FHFA issued the proposed PMIERs, which do not include a specific ratings requirement.\nRadian Guaranty\u2019s financial strength ratings currently are below the ratings assigned to certain other private mortgage insurers, some of which have been assigned investment grade ratings. Despite this, we have been successful in competing in the private mortgage insurance market, and we do not believe our current ratings have had a material adverse affect on our relationships with customers. To the extent this changes, however, and financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings.\nWe believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-QM loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis, we view this market as an area of potential future growth and our ability to participate in this market could depend on our ability to secure investment grade ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operated in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.\nWe expect to incur future losses beyond what we have recorded in our financial statements.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists. As a result, future losses beyond what we have recorded in our financial statements may have a material impact on future results as defaults occur.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our capital position.\nWe establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims. Because our reserves represent only our best estimate of claims to be paid in the future, these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty, such as we have recently experienced.\nMany of the programs and initiatives that have been implemented to prevent or forestall mortgage foreclosures, as well as the significant backlog of foreclosure proceedings in many states that impose a judicial process on such proceedings, have resulted in fewer defaulted loans moving to claim, and consequently, an increase in the aging of our inventory of defaulted loans. As a result, the number of our defaulted loans that have been in default for an extended period of time currently represent a much larger portion of our default inventory than has historically been the case. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be significantly less than historical rates, and therefore, less than our current estimates of cures for this inventory of defaults. Further, the foreclosure moratoriums and other delays have resulted in further aging of our defaulted loan portfolio, which has created additional uncertainty regarding the likelihood, magnitude and timing of anticipated losses. If our estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, capital position and operating results.\nIn addition to establishing mortgage insurance loss reserves for defaulted loans, under GAAP, we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve, or PDR, for our mortgage insurance products if the amount by which the net present value of expected future losses for a particular product and the expenses for such product exceeds the net present value of expected future premiums and existing reserves for such product. We evaluate whether a premium deficiency exists at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2014, a PDR of approximately $2.2 million existed for our Second-lien insurance business. Our evaluation of premium deficiency is based on our best estimate of future losses, expenses and premiums. This evaluation depends upon many significant assumptions, including assumptions regarding future macroeconomic conditions, and therefore, is inherently uncertain and may prove to be inaccurate. Although no premium deficiency existed on our First-lien insurance business at December 31, 2014, there can be no assurance that a PDR will not be required for this product or our other mortgage insurance products in future periods.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain an investment policy to manage our investments and those of our insurance subsidiaries. We may be forced to change our investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions and our existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements, including the tax position, of our business segments. In addition, if we underestimate our policy liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet those liabilities, we could have unexpected losses, including losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity.\nOur investment objectives may not be achieved. Although our portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated investments, the success of our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of our fixed-income securities. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we hold positions has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, and if this worsens substantially it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nCompared to historical averages, interest rates and investment yields on our investments generally have declined in recent years, which has reduced the investment income we generate. In addition, we have kept a larger portion of our investment portfolio in shorter maturity investments in order to meet the expected liquidity needs of our operating subsidiaries. This, in turn, has further reduced our investment income, as interest rates on short-term investments have been minimal. We depend on our investments as a source of revenue and a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could potentially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\nRadian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. Radian Group\u2019s principal liquidity demands are expected to include funds for: (i) additional capital support for Radian Guaranty; (ii) the payment of corporate expenses; (iii) interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt; (iv) the repayment of our outstanding long-term debt, including $195.5 million principal amount of outstanding debt due in June 2017, $450 million principal amount of convertible debt due in November 2017, and, at our option, any related conversion premium that we elect to settle in cash, potentially $400 million of convertible debt due in March 2019 for which the principal amount and any conversion premium may, at our option, be settled in cash, and $300 million principal amount of outstanding debt due in June 2019; (v) potential payments to the U.S. Treasury resulting from our dispute with the IRS relating to the examination of our 2000 through 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns by the IRS ( See \u201cResolution of our dispute with the IRS could adversely affect us..\u201d); (vi) potential investments to support our long-term strategy of growing our fee-based businesses and diversifying our sources of revenues; and (vii) the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAt December 31, 2014, Radian Group had immediately available, either directly or through an unregulated subsidiary, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of approximately $670 million, after giving effect to the $100 million capital contribution from Radian Guaranty in February 2015. The approximately $670 million of available cash and liquid investments as of December 31, 2014 excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced from our subsidiaries for corporate expenses and interest payments. Substantially all of Radian Group\u2019s obligations to pay corporate expenses and interest payments on outstanding debt are reimbursed to Radian Group through the expense-sharing arrangements currently in place with its subsidiaries.\nWe expect the PMIERs Financial Requirements to be effective by the end of 2015. We currently expect that Radian Guaranty\u2019s compliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements as proposed will require Radian Group to contribute a substantial portion of its cash and investments to Radian Guaranty. The amount that we ultimately decide to contribute to Radian Guaranty will depend on, among other things, the amount of cash and investments that we plan to maintain at Radian Group to carry out our business strategy, and whether we are successful in: (1) completing the pending sale of Radian Asset Assurance to Assured pursuant to the Radian Asset Assurance Stock Purchase Agreement; and (2) leveraging other options such as commutations of existing risk or external reinsurance for a portion of our mortgage insurance RIF in a manner that provides capital relief and is compliant with the PMIERs. In the event we are unable to successfully execute these or similar transactions or strategies, or such transactions are not available on terms that are attractive to us, we may seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity, or by selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nAssuming that Radian Group contributes a substantial portion of its cash and investments to Radian Guaranty, our financial flexibility may be significantly reduced, leaving us with limited funds to satisfy our financial obligations, including our long-term debt that is scheduled to mature in June and November of 2017. In this case, we would expect to seek to refinance this long-term debt, which we may not be able to do on attractive terms, if at all.\nRadian Group also could be required to provide capital support for Radian Guaranty and our other mortgage insurance subsidiaries if additional capital is required pursuant to insurance laws and regulations. The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. These changes could include more stringent capital requirements for Radian Guaranty, which, if adopted, could increase the capital requirements for Radian Guaranty in states that adopt the new Model Act. In addition, certain of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries that provide reinsurance to Radian Guaranty have required, and in the future may again require, additional capital contributions from Radian Group.\nCash flows from our investment portfolio, dividends from Clayton and Radian Guaranty and permitted payments to Radian Group under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are Radian Group\u2019s principal sources of cash. Radian Group expects to receive a modest amount of dividend payments over the next 12 months from positive cash flows generated by Clayton and these potential dividend payments would be adversely impacted if unanticipated events and circumstances were to result in lower earnings than expected. See \u201cWe face risks associated with our acquisition of Clayton and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition.\u201d We do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to issue dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future in light of Radian Guaranty\u2019s periods of operating losses. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by applicable state insurance departments, but such approval may be revoked at any time.\nIn light of Radian Group\u2019s long- and short-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations and could exceed currently available holding company funds. If this were to occur, we may need or otherwise may decide to increase our available liquidity by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity or by selling assets, any of which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our trading securities and short-term investments that require us to adjust their fair market value and changes in our stock price impacting the fair value of certain stock-based compensation awards.\nWe have significant assets that we carry at fair value, with changes in fair market value recorded on our statements of operations each period. These assets include our trading securities and short-term investments. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations, they have the potential to affect our reported earnings and create earnings volatility. Economic conditions, as well as adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses.\nUnder our long-term incentive compensation program, we currently have outstanding stock-based performance awards that are settled in cash. These awards mainly consist of performance-based RSU awards that were granted in 2012 and which vest in June 2015. For more information regarding these awards, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Because these awards are cash-settled, we are required to determine their fair value as of the end of each reporting period and to record any changes in their fair value within other operating expenses. As a result, any change in the fair value of these awards, which is highly correlated to changes in our stock price, can result in volatility in our results of operations during the periods that these awards remain outstanding.\nOur information technology systems may fail or we may experience an interruption in their operation.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion. We rely on our information technology systems for many enterprise-critical functions and a prolonged failure or interruption of these systems for any reason could cause significant disruption to our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may lose business if we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 technological demands.\nOur ability to meet the needs of our customers is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. Participants in the mortgage insurance industry rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide their products and services. Our customers generally require that we provide aspects of our products and services electronically and the percentage of our NIW and claims processing that we deliver electronically has continued to increase. We expect this trend to continue and, accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or otherwise are unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. This may result in a decrease in the business we receive, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems may become outdated and we may not be able to make timely modifications to support our products and services.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems. Many of our information technology systems have been in place for a number of years. When we make changes to our existing products and services, or as new products with new features emerge, our systems require modification in order to support these products and process transactions appropriately. Making appropriate modifications to our systems involves inherent time lags and may require us to incur significant expenses. If we are unable to make necessary modifications to our systems in a timely and cost-effective manner or successfully upgrade our systems to avoid obsolescence of our information technology platform, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nWe are in the process of implementing a major technology project to improve our operating systems, including a new platform for our mortgage insurance underwriting, policy administration, claims management and billing processes. The project is intended to enhance our business and technological capabilities by increasing operational efficiencies and reducing complexity. The implementation of these technological improvements is complex, expensive, time consuming and, in certain respects, depends on the ability of third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner. If we fail to timely and successfully implement the new technology systems and business processes, or if the systems do not operate as expected, it could have an adverse impact on our business, business prospects and results of operations.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks. As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on consumers and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our reputation. While we believe we have appropriate information security policies and systems in place in order to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, damage our reputation and customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that inherently pose a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. We currently are a party to material litigation and are subject to certain regulatory proceedings. The cost to defend these actions and the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and other matters may also arise in the future.\nWe and other private mortgage insurers currently are defendants in a series of putative class action lawsuits under RESPA with respect to our captive reinsurance agreements. In addition, we and other mortgage insurers have been, and with respect to the Minnesota Department of Commerce we currently are, subject to inquiries and investigative demands from state and federal governmental agencies requesting information relating to our captive reinsurance arrangements. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Various regulators, including the CFPB, state insurance commissioners or state attorneys general may bring additional actions or proceedings regarding our compliance with RESPA or other laws applicable to our businesses. We cannot predict whether additional actions or proceedings will be brought against us or the outcome of any such actions or proceedings.\nDuring the period following the financial crisis, the amount of insurance we rescinded due to fraud, misrepresentation, underwriting negligence or other non-compliance with our insurance policies increased significantly and we denied a significant number of claims for failing to satisfy the claim perfection requirements under our Prior Master Policy. In more recent years, we have curtailed a significant number of claims as a result of servicers failing to satisfy the standards set forth in our Prior Master Policy and servicing guidelines, thereby increasing our risk of loss.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities and claim payment practices have resulted in disputes with our customers, which has heightened the risk of litigation and in some cases, damaged our relationships with certain customers. While we have resolved many of our remaining disputes, if we do not successfully resolve our continuing disputes, it could result in arbitration or judicial proceedings.\nSee also \u201cLegislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses\u201d and \u201cResolution of our dispute with the IRS could adversely affect us..\u201d\nResolution of our dispute with the IRS could adversely affect us.\nWe are currently contesting proposed adjustments resulting from the examination by the IRS of our 2000 through 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns. The IRS opposes the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through RGRI\u2019s investment in a portfolio of non-economic REMIC residual interests and has proposed adjustments denying the associated tax benefits of these items. We appealed these proposed adjustments to Appeals and made \u201cqualified deposits\u201d with the U.S. Treasury in the amount of approximately $85 million in June 2008 relating to the 2000 through 2004 tax years and approximately $4 million in May 2010 relating to the 2005 through 2007 tax years to avoid the accrual of above-market-rate interest with respect to the proposed adjustments.\nAlthough we made several attempts to reach a compromised settlement with Appeals, on September 4, 2014, we received Notices of Deficiency covering the 2000 through 2007 tax years. The Notices of Deficiency exclude any potential benefit related to our NOL carryback ability and assert unpaid taxes and penalties related to the REMIC matters of approximately $157 million. As of December 31, 2014, there also would be interest of approximately $115 million related to these matters. Depending on the outcome, additional state income taxes, penalties and interest (in the aggregate estimated to be approximately $30 million) also may become due when a final resolution is reached. The Notices of Deficiency also reflected additional amounts due of approximately $105 million, which are primarily associated with the disallowance of the previously filed carryback of our 2008 NOL to the 2006 and 2007 tax years. We currently believe that the disallowance of our 2008 NOL carryback is a precautionary position by the IRS and that we will ultimately maintain the benefit of this NOL carryback claim.\nOn December 3, 2014, we petitioned the U.S. Tax Court to litigate the Deficiency Amount. The litigation could take several years to resolve and may result in substantial legal expenses. We can provide no assurance regarding the outcome of any such litigation or whether a compromised settlement with the IRS will ultimately be reached. If the ultimate resolution of this matter produces a result that differs materially from our current expectations, there could be a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and cash flows.\nRadian Group has assumed the obligation to pay RGRI\u2019s portion of the liabilities associated with these tax matters by indemnifying RGRI for such liabilities, including any portion of the \u201cqualified deposits\u201d that is used to satisfy such liabilities. See \u201cRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\u201d\nOur ability to recognize tax benefits on future U.S. tax losses and our existing U.S. loss positions may be limited under applicable tax laws.\nWe have generated substantial NOLs, loss carryforwards and other tax attributes for U.S. tax purposes that can be used to reduce our future federal income tax obligations. Our ability to fully utilize these tax assets (including NOLs of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2014) on a timely basis (i.e. to offset operating income as generated) will be adversely affected if we have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point increase in equity ownership by \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Section 382) in any three-year period. We may experience an \u201cownership change\u201d in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership.\nOn October 8, 2009, our Board adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which, as amended, was approved by our stockholders at our 2010 and 2013 annual meetings. We also adopted certain amendments to our amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaw Amendment\u201d) and at our 2010 and 2013 annual meetings, our stockholders approved certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cCharter Amendment\u201d). The Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment were implemented in order to protect our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax assets and prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d under U.S. federal income tax rules by restricting or discouraging certain transfers of our common stock that would: (i) create or result in a person becoming a five-percent shareholder under Section 382; or (ii) increase the stock ownership of any existing five-percent shareholder under Section 382. The continued effectiveness of the Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment are subject to the reapproval of the Plan and the Charter Amendment by our stockholders every three years and there can be no assurance that if we elect to present them to our stockholders for reapproval in the future, our stockholders will reapprove them.\nThere is no guarantee that our tax benefit preservation strategy will be effective in protecting our NOLs and other tax assets. The amount of our NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of our NOLs and other tax assets, which could result in an increase in our liability in the future for income taxes. In addition, determining whether an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, even though we currently have several measures in place to protect our NOLs (such as the Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment), we cannot provide any assurance that the IRS or other taxing authority will not claim that we have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d and attempt to reduce the benefit of our tax assets.\nLegislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to or may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations and may be affected by changes in these laws and regulations. In particular, our businesses may be significantly impacted by the following:\n\u2022\nLegislation or regulatory action impacting the charters or business practices of the GSEs;\n\u2022\nLegislative reform of the U.S. housing finance system;\n\u2022\nLegislation and regulation impacting the FHA and its competitive position versus private mortgage insurers. See \u201cOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\u201d;\n\u2022\nState insurance laws and regulations that address, among other items, licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates, policy forms offered to customers and requirements for Risk-to-capital, minimum policyholder positions, reserves (including contingency reserves), surplus, reinsurance and payment of dividends. See \u201cOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, including capital adequacy measures, which if we fail to satisfy, could limit our ability to write new insurance and increase restrictions and requirements placed on our insurance subsidiaries.\u201d;\n\u2022\nThe application of state, federal or private sector programs aimed at supporting borrowers and the housing market;\n\u2022\nThe application of RESPA, the FCRA and other laws to mortgage insurers, including with respect to captive reinsurance arrangements. See \u201cWe are subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings.\u201d;\n\u2022\nThe amendments to Regulation AB (commonly referred to as Regulation AB II) that were adopted by the SEC in August 2014 to introduce several new requirements related to public offerings of ABS, including public offerings of RMBS for which our MRES business traditionally has provided due diligence and servicer surveillance services and new credit rating agency reform rules (the \u201cNRSRO Rules\u201d) adopted by the SEC in August 2014, including new requirements applicable to providers of third-party due diligence services, such as our MRES business, for both publicly and privately issued ABS;\n\u2022\nNew federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers, including as a result of the Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Treasury having published a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the U.S. that, among other things, calls for federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers to be developed and implemented. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Other Federal Regulation-The Dodd-Frank Act.\u201d;\n\u2022\nThe implementation of new regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Other Federal Regulation-The Dodd-Frank Act.\u201d; and\n\u2022\nThe implementation in the U.S. of the Basel II capital adequacy requirements and the Basel III guidelines. See \u201cThe implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance.\u201d\nAny of the items discussed above could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our mortgage insurance business could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, as well as changes to existing legislation or regulations, that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time.\nThe implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance.\nIn 1988, the BCBS developed Basel I, which established international benchmarks for assessing banks\u2019 capital adequacy requirements. In June 2005, the BCBS issued Basel II which, among other things, governs the capital treatment for mortgage insurance purchased by domestic and international banks in both their origination and securitization activities. Basel II was implemented by many banks in the U.S. and in many other countries in 2009 and 2010.\nIn September 2010, the BCBS released Basel III guidelines, which increased the capital requirements for certain banking organizations. In December 2010, the BCBS released a new bank capital framework, which we refer to as the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines, that raised minimum capital requirements for banks. Implementation of Basel III and the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines in the U.S. required formal regulations to be adopted by the three U.S. federal banking regulators.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulators published rules to implement the Basel III guidelines. As published, these rules would have made extensive changes to the capital requirements for residential mortgages. In addition, the published rules would have eliminated existing capital recognition for certain low down payment mortgages if covered by mortgage insurance. After consideration of extensive comments on the published rules, the federal regulators revised the Basel III rules to retain the current treatment for residential mortgages under the general risk-based capital rules for U.S. banking institutions.\nIf implementation of the Basel III Rules increases the capital requirements of banking institutions with respect to the residential mortgages we insure, it could reduce the demand for our mortgage insurance. If the federal bank regulators revise their rules to implement Basel III to reduce or eliminate the capital benefit banks receive from insuring low down payment loans with private mortgage insurance, our business and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with our acquisition of Clayton and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Clayton and our entry into the businesses of our MRES segment, we are exposed to certain risks that may negatively affect our financial results, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nOur MRES revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our MRES total revenues. Radian Guaranty also does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWhile Clayton is not a defendant in litigation arising out of the financial crisis involving the issuance of RMBS in connection with which it has provided services, it has been in the past, and may again be in the future, subpoenaed by various parties to provide documents and information related to such litigation, and there can be no assurance that Clayton will not be subject to future claims against it, whether in connection with such litigation or otherwise. It is possible that our exposure to potential liabilities resulting from our MRES business, some of which may be material or unknown, could exceed amounts we can recover through indemnification claims.\n\u2022\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets were established primarily in connection with our acquisition of Clayton. Goodwill represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from the assets we have acquired that did not qualify to be identified and recognized individually, and includes the value of expected future cash flows of Clayton, Clayton\u2019s workforce, expected synergies with our other affiliates and other unidentifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is subject to review for impairment annually, or more frequently, whenever circumstances indicate potential impairment. The value of goodwill is supported by revenue, which is driven primarily by transaction volume. Intangible assets other than goodwill primarily consist of customer relationships, client backlog, trade name and trademarks, software and non-competition agreements; and\n\u2022\nThe calculation of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangibles requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective in nature, such as attrition rates, discount rates, future expected cash flows and market conditions. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If actual results differ from our assumptions, we may not realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill.\nFor these and other reasons there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits from the transaction will be realized fully or at all. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition, we may not realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisition, in which case we may be required to write down or write off all such intangible assets or goodwill. Such an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "RDN"}
