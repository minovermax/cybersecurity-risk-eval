{"cik": "1509589", "company": "Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA substantial or extended decline in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations or targets and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, access to capital, present value and quality of our reserves, the nature and scale of our operations and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Because approximately 65% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 were oil and NGLs, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. During fourth quarter 2014, a significant decline in crude oil prices occurred. As a result, we experienced decreases in crude oil revenues and recorded asset impairment charges due to commodity price declines. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $107.26 per Bbl to a low of $53.27 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas HH spot price ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu to a low of $2.89 per MMBtu. As of February 23, 2015, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price and NYMEX natural gas HH spot price was $49.56 per Bbl and $3.22 per MMBtu, respectively.\nThe prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe actions from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of competitors' supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure; and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under short-term (less than 12-month) contracts at market based prices. Declines in commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n\u00b7\nreduction of our revenues, profit margins, operating income and cash flows;\n\u00b7\nreduction in the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically;\n\u00b7\ncertain properties in our portfolio becoming economically unviable;\n\u00b7\ndelay or postponement of some of our capital projects;\n\u00b7\nfurther reduction of our 2015 capital program, or significant reductions in future capital programs, resulting in a reduced ability to develop our reserves;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our financial condition, liquidity and/or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations;\n\u00b7\nreduction to the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility or limitations in our access to sources of capital, such as equity or debt;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in our stock price;\n\u00b7\nasset impairment charges resulting from reductions in the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties (particularly with respect to our Mid-Continent acreage) at the date of assessment;\n\u00b7\nadditional counterparty credit risk exposure on commodity hedges; and\n\u00b7\nreduction in the carrying value of goodwill.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the price of oil and may be affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil and natural gas.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had commodity price derivative agreements on approximately 9,985 Bbls/d and 5,500 Bbls/d of oil hedged with a combination of fixed price swaps and three-way collars during 2015 and 2016, respectively, and approximately 15,000 Mcf/d of natural gas hedged during 2015 with three-way collars. These commodity price derivatives represent approximately 60% of our anticipated production in 2015. These hedges may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil and natural gas. To the extent that the price of oil and natural gas remains at current levels or declines further, we will not be able to hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nIn 2015, we have 6,251 Bbls/d of oil hedged with three-way collars with an average ceiling of $95.52/Bbl, average floor of $84.43/Bbl and average short floor of $68.20/Bbl. In 2015, we have 15,000 Mcf/d of natural gas hedged with three-way collars with an average ceiling of $4.75/Mcf, average floor of $4.00/Mcf and average short floor of $3.50/Mcf. In 2016, we have 5,500 Bbls/d of oil hedged with three-way collars with an average ceiling of $96.83/Bbl, average floor of $85.00/Bbl and average short floor of $70.00/Bbl. Currently, oil and natural gas prices are trading below the average prices of our short floors associated with our three-way collars. To the extent that future monthly settlement prices are below our short floor prices, we will realize the settlement price plus the difference between our short floor and floor prices. Therefore, additional risk is associated with these three-way collar contracts in a declining commodity price environment relative to fixed price swaps and collars. See the Derivative Activity section in Part I, Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of our hedging activity.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see Our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors, including the following factors, may result in substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, penalties, damage or destruction of property and equipment, and curtailments, delays or cancellations of our scheduled drilling projects:\n\u00b7\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u00b7\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u00b7\nunexpected operational events;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated environmental liabilities;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions, such as blizzards, ice storms, tornadoes, floods, and fires;\n\u00b7\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements, such as permitting delays;\n\u00b7\nproximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\nsafety concerns, and\n\u00b7\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Estimated Proved Reserves under Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves and the PV-10 (a non-GAAP financial measure) as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of these data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Although the reserve information contained herein is reviewed by independent reserve engineers, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise particularly as they relate to state-of-the-art technologies being employed such as the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our impairment charges. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThere is a limited amount of production data from horizontal wells completed in the Wattenberg Field. As a result, reserve estimates associated with horizontal wells in this Field are subject to greater uncertainty than estimates associated with reserves attributable to vertical wells in the same Field.\nReserve engineers rely in part on the production history of nearby wells in establishing reserve estimates for a particular well or field. Horizontal drilling in the Wattenberg Field is a relatively recent development, whereas vertical drilling has been utilized by producers in this Field for over 50 years. As a result, the amount of production data from horizontal wells available to reserve engineers is relatively small. Until a greater number of horizontal wells have been completed in the Wattenberg Field, and a longer production history from these wells has been established, there may be a greater variance in our proved reserves on a year-over-year basis due to the transition from vertical to horizontal reserves in both the proved developed and proved undeveloped categories. We cannot assure you that any such variance would not be material and any such variance could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations. In addition, quantities of probable and possible reserves by definition are inherently more risky than proved reserves and are less likely to be recovered.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the regions where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region in both cases. In certain areas on federal lands, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities can only be conducted during limited times of the year. These restrictions limit our ability to operate in those areas and can potentially intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Similarly, hot weather during some recent periods adversely impacted the transportation services provided by midstream companies, and therefore our production. Similar events could occur in the future and could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices (after adjustment for location and quality differentials) for the preceding twelve months, without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas and hedging instruments;\n\u00b7\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of future development costs;\n\u00b7\nthe supply and demand of oil and natural gas; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor (the factor required by the SEC) used when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nBecause market prices for oil at the end of 2014 were significantly lower than the average price for the year determined under SEC rules, the actual future prices and costs will likely differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If oil and natural gas prices declined by 10% per Bbl and Mcf then our PV-10 as of December 31, 2014 would decrease by approximately 20% or $273.6 million. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to Estimated Proved Reserves under Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for management\u2019s discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nDepressed oil and natural gas prices could require us to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans,\nproduction data, economics and other factors, from time to time, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We recorded a $167.6 million impairment of oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to depressed commodity prices. Additionally, we may incur significant impairment charges in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nWe intend to pursue the further development of our properties in the Wattenberg Field through horizontal drilling. Horizontal drilling operations can be more operationally challenging and costly relative to our historic vertical drilling operations. Our limited operational history with drilling and completing horizontal wells may make us more susceptible to cost overruns and lower results.\nHorizontal drilling is generally more complex and more expensive on a per well basis than vertical drilling. As a result, there is greater risk associated with a horizontal well drilling program. Risks associated with our horizontal drilling program include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could materially and adversely impact the success of our horizontal drilling program and thus, our cash flows and results of operations:\n\u00b7\nlanding our well bore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u00b7\neffectively controlling the level of pressure flowing from particular wells;\n\u00b7\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u00b7\nrunning our casing the entire length of the well bore;\n\u00b7\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore;\n\u00b7\nbeing able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u00b7\npreventing downhole communications with other wells;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and\n\u00b7\ndesigning and maintaining efficient forms of artificial lift throughout the life of the well.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, such as horizontal drilling in the Niobrara formation, are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas or using technologies that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history, and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, limited takeaway capacity, or depressed natural gas and oil prices, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments, we could incur material write-downs of our oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur ability to produce natural gas and oil economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.\nThe hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. Compliance with environmental\nregulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to expiration of our leases or a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or anticipated production volumes.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation activities are capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Our cash flows used in investing activities, excluding derivative cash settlements, were $837.2 million, of which, $832.8 million (including $191.6 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties and contractual obligations for land acquisitions) related to capital and exploration expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our capital expenditure budget for 2015 is approximately $420 million, with approximately $380 million allocated for operated drilling and completion activities. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.\nA significant improvement in oil and gas prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of additional equity securities, debt securities or the strategic sale of assets. The issuance of additional debt may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. In addition, upon the issuance of certain debt securities (other than on a borrowing base redetermination date), our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility would be reduced. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock.\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7\nour proved reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas production;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe ability and willingness of our banks to lend; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nIf the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility or our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the\ncapital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or cash available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our drilling locations, which in turn could lead to a possible expiration of our leases and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nRecent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability, impacting our ability to finance our operations. Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe may experience difficulty in achieving and managing future growth.\nWe have experienced growth in the past primarily through the expansion of our drilling program and acquisitions. Our ability to grow depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain leases or options on properties, including those for which we have 3-D seismic data;\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop existing prospects;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our drilling program;\n\u00b7\noil and natural gas prices; and\n\u00b7\nour access to capital.\nFuture growth may place strains on our financial, technical, operational and administrative resources and cause us to rely more on project partners and independent contractors, possibly negatively affecting our financial position and results of operations. Our inability to achieve or manage growth may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur ability to pursue our growth strategy may be hindered if we are not able to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees. As a result, we are required to continue to invest in operational, financial and management information systems to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage our employees.\nConcentration of our operations in a few core areas may increase our risk of production loss.\nOur assets and operations are concentrated in two core areas: the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in southern Arkansas. These core areas currently provide approximately 99% of our current sales volumes and the vast majority of our development projects. Beginning in 2012, we initiated a non-core divestiture program to focus our portfolio through the sale of certain non-core assets in California. This program was completed in the first quarter of 2014 when we sold our last asset in California. As a result of these portfolio changes, our operations and production are more concentrated.\nThe Wattenberg and Dorcheat Macedonia Fields represent 75% and 24%, respectively, of our 2014 total sales volumes. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as some of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including: fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from wells in the area, accidents or natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations and curtailment of production or interruption in the availability of gathering, processing or transportation infrastructure and services, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells. For example, recent increases in activity in the Wattenberg Field have contributed to bottlenecks in processing and transportation that have negatively affected our results of operations, and these adverse effects may be disproportionately severe to us compared to our more geographically diverse competitors. Similarly, the concentration of our assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules, that could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the Wattenberg Field, we are subject to increasing competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages or delays. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nWe do not maintain business interruption (loss of production) insurance for our oil and gas producing properties. Loss of production or limited access to reserves in either of our core operating areas could have a significant negative impact on our cash flows and profitability.\nWe are dependent on third party pipeline, trucking and rail systems to transport our production and, in the Wattenberg Field, gathering and processing systems to prepare our production. These systems have limited capacity and at times have experienced service disruptions. Curtailments, disruptions or lack of availability in these systems interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce, and could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production getting to market. The marketability of our oil and natural gas and production, particularly from our wells located in the Wattenberg Field, depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing, pipeline, trucking and rail systems. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of accidents, excessive pressures, maintenance, weather, field labor issues or disruptions in service. Curtailments and disruptions in these systems may last from a few days to several months. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity. These risks are greater for us than for some of our competitors because our operations are focused on areas where there is currently a substantial amount of development activity, which increases the likelihood that there will be periods of time in which there is insufficient midstream capacity to accommodate the resulting increases in production. For example, in 2014, the principal third-party provider we use in the Wattenberg Field experienced periods of high line pressures and was forced to periodically shut down due to oxygen in the line and for other unscheduled repairs. The resulting capacity constrained our production and reduced our revenue from the affected wells. In addition, we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transport, would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas we produce, and could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations, and the expected results of our drilling program.\nCurrently, there are no natural gas pipeline systems that service wells in the North Park Basin, which is prospective for the Niobrara formation. In addition, we are not aware of any plans to construct a facility necessary to process natural gas produced from this basin. If neither we nor a third party constructs the required pipeline system and processing facility, we may not be able to fully develop our resources in the North Park Basin.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nApproximately 48% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of December 31, 2014. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our current proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced and, therefore, our level of production and cash flows will be affected adversely unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves. Thus, our future oil and natural gas production and, therefore, our cash flow and income are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. However, we cannot assure you that our future acquisition, development and exploration activities will result in any specific amount of additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.\nAccording to estimates included in our December 31, 2014 proved reserve report, if, on January 1, 2015, we had ceased all drilling and development, including recompletions, refracs and workovers, then our proved developed producing reserves base would decline at an annual effective rate of 45% during the first year. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling, our level of production and cash flows will be affected adversely.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks, including those related to our hydraulic fracturing operations.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including, but not limited to, the possibility of:\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as spills, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, natural gas, hazardous air pollutants or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u00b7\nreleases of natural gas and hazardous air pollutants or other substances into the atmosphere (including releases at our gas processing facilities);\n\u00b7\nhazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or other contaminants in natural gas we produce;\n\u00b7\nabnormally pressured formations resulting in well blowouts, fires or explosions;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u00b7\ncratering (catastrophic failure);\n\u00b7\ndownhole communication leading to migration of contaminants;\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries and death; and\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nrepair and remediation costs.\nThe presence of H2S, a toxic, flammable and colorless gas, is a common risk in the oil and gas industry and may be present in small amounts for brief periods from time to time at our well locations. Additionally, at two of our Arkansas properties, we produce a small amount of gas from seven operated wells where we have identified the presence of H2S at levels that would be hazardous in the event of an uncontrolled gas release or unprotected exposure. In addition, our operations in Arkansas and Colorado are susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as flooding, wildfires or tornados, which involve increased risks of personal injury, property damage and marketing interruptions. The occurrence of one of these operating hazards may result in injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, environmental damage and remediation and/or governmental investigations and penalties. The payment of any of these liabilities could reduce, or even eliminate, the funds available for exploration and development, or could result in a loss of our properties.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. Although we believe the coverage and amounts of insurance that we carry are consistent with industry practice, we do not have insurance protection against all risks that we face, because we choose not to insure certain risks, insurance is not available at a level that balances the costs of insurance and our desired rates of return, or actual losses exceed coverage limits. Insurance costs will likely continue to increase which could result in our determination to decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate those cost increases. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If we incur substantial liability, and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nBecause hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if the operator is unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the \u201coccurrence\u201d to the insurance company within the required time frame. Nor do we have coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events.\nUnder certain circumstances, we have agreed to indemnify third parties against losses resulting from our operations. Pursuant to our surface leases, we typically indemnify the surface owner for clean-up and remediation of the site. As owner and operator of oil and gas wells and associated gathering systems and pipelines, we typically indemnify the drilling contractor for pollution emanating from the well, while the contractor indemnifies us against pollution emanating from its equipment.\nDrilling locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nWe describe some of our drilling locations and our plans to explore those drilling locations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location that is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional evaluation. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and\ntesting whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Prior to drilling, the use of 2-D and 3-D seismic technologies, various other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. In addition, the use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data and other technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur greater drilling and testing expenses as a result of such expenditures which may result in a reduction in our returns or increase our losses. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill any dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive.\nOur potential drilling locations are scheduled to be developed over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our potential drilling locations.\nOur management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These potential drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty in the level of reserves, the availability of capital to us and other participants, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, availability of permits, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. Pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade to probable or possible any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame. These limitations may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nThe terms of our oil and gas leases stipulate that the lease will terminate if not held by production, rentals, or operations. As of the filing date of this report, the majority of our acreage in Arkansas was held by unitization, production, or drilling operations and therefore not subject to lease expiration. As of the filing date of this report, approximately 18,704 net acres of our properties in the Rocky Mountain region were not held by production. For these properties, if production in paying quantities is not established on units containing these leases during the next year, then approximately 12,717 net acres will expire in 2015, approximately 5,110 net acres will expire in 2016, and approximately 876 net acres will expire in 2017 and thereafter. While some expiring leases may contain predetermined renewal payments, other expiring leases will require us to negotiate new leases at the time of lease expiration. It is possible that market conditions at the time of negotiation could require us to agree to new leases on less favorable terms to us than the terms of the expired leases.If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.\nThe existence of a title deficiency can diminish the value of an acquired leasehold interest and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Title insurance covering mineral leasehold interests is not generally available. In certain situations, we may rely upon a land professional\u2019s careful examination of public records prior to purchasing or leasing a mineral interest. Once a specific mineral or leasehold interest has been acquired, we typically defer the expense of obtaining further title verification by a practicing title attorney until approval to drill the related drilling block is required. We do not always perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of\nthe title; however, we currently have compliance and control measures to ensure any associated business risk is approved by the appropriate Company authority. In cases involving more serious title deficiencies, all or part of a mineral or leasehold interest may be determined to be invalid or unleased, and, as a result, the target area may be deemed to be undrillable until owners can be contacted and curative measures performed to perfect title. In other cases, title deficiencies may result in our failure to have paid royalty owners correctly. Certain title deficiencies may also result in litigation from time to time. Additional title issues are present in our southern Arkansas operations where significant delays in the title examination process are possible due to, among other challenges, the large volume of instruments contained in abstracts, poor indexing at the county clerk and recorder\u2019s office, misfiling of instruments, instruments with missing or inadequate legal descriptions and unclear conveyance terms.\nAcquisitions of properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\nAcquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped properties have been an important part of our recent and historical growth. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, development potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, title issues and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform engineering, environmental, geological and geophysical reviews of the acquired properties, which we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, such reviews are not likely to permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well prior to an acquisition and our ability to evaluate undeveloped acreage is inherently imprecise. Even when we inspect a well, we may not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. In some cases, our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited. In addition, from time to time we also acquire acreage without any warranty of title except as to claims made by, through or under the transferor.\nWhen we acquire properties, we will generally have potential exposure to liabilities and costs for environmental and other problems existing on the acquired properties, and these liabilities may exceed our estimates. Often we are not entitled to contractual indemnification associated with acquired properties. In certain cases, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with no or limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. Therefore, we could incur significant unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, or losses due to title defects, in connection with acquisitions for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. In addition, the acquisition of undeveloped acreage is subject to many inherent risks and we may not be able to realize efficiently, or at all, the assumed or expected economic benefits of acreage that we acquire.\nFurthermore, significant acquisitions could change the nature of our operations depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or may be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. These factors can increase the risks associated with an acquisition. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price, and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nWe face various risks associated with the trend toward increased activism against oil and gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, environmental compliance and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as the development of oil or gas shale plays. For example, environmental activists continue to advocate for increased regulations or bans on shale drilling in the United States, even in jurisdictions that are among the most stringent in their regulation of the industry. In fact, New York State has just enacted a permanent moratorium on all hydraulic fracturing operations. Future activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u00b7\ndelay or denial of drilling permits;\n\u00b7\nshortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on installation or operation of production, gathering or processing facilities;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing, or the disposal of related waste materials, such as hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;\n\u00b7\nincreased severance and/or other taxes;\n\u00b7\ncyber-attacks;\n\u00b7\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity about us or the oil and gas industry in general;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs of doing business;\n\u00b7\nreduction in demand for our products; and\n\u00b7\nother adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.\nWe may need to incur significant costs associated with responding to these initiatives. Complying with any resulting additional legal or regulatory requirements that are substantial could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may impose on our operations numerous requirements, including the obligation to obtain a permit before conducting drilling or underground injection activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; limitations or prohibitions of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria to protect workers; and the responsibility for cleaning up any pollution resulting from operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations; the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations; delays in granting permits, or even the cancellation of leases.\nThere is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions into air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes, the use and disposition of hydraulic fracturing fluids, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the full cost of removing or remediating contamination, regardless of whether we were at fault, and even when multiple parties contributed to the release and the contaminants were released in compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, accidental spills or releases on our properties may expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Aside from government agencies, the owners of properties where our wells are located, the operators of facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal and other private parties may be able to sue us to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations, collect penalties for violations or obtain damages for any related personal injury or\nproperty damage. Some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that historic contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly material handling, emission, waste management or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nNew environmental legislation or regulatory initiatives, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Government authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing specifically, are receiving increasing regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.\nIn August 2012, the EPA issued final New Source Performance Standards (known as \u201cQuad O\u201d) that establish new air emission controls for natural gas processing operations, as well as for oil and natural gas production. Among other things, Quad O imposes reduced emission completion (or \u201cgreen completion\u201d) requirements and also imposes stringent control and other standards on certain storage tanks, compressors and associated equipment. After several parties challenged the Quad O regulations in court, the EPA administratively reconsidered certain requirements. As a result of such administrative reconsideration, the EPA issued final amendments to the Quad O regulations in September 2013 and December 2014, and is evaluating whether further reconsideration is warranted. At this point, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such air regulatory requirements.\nOn December 17, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise and lower the existing 75 ppb NAAQS for ozone under the federal Clean Air Act to a range within 65-70 ppb. The EPA is also taking public comment on whether the ozone NAAQS should be revised as low as 60 ppb. A lowered ozone NAAQS in a range of 60-70 ppb could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. In addition, in February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s Air Quality Control Commission finalized regulations imposing stringent new requirements relating to air emissions from oil and gas facilities in Colorado that are even more stringent than comparable federal rules. These new Colorado rules include storage tank control, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements as well as leak detection and repair requirements for both well production facilities and compressor stations and associated equipment. These new requirements, which represent the first time a state has directly regulated methane (a greenhouse gas) emissions from the upstream oil and gas sector, have and will continue to impose additional costs on our operations.\nSome activists have attempted to link hydraulic fracturing to various environmental problems, including potential adverse effects to drinking water supplies as well as migration of methane and other hydrocarbons. As a result, the federal government is studying the environmental risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and evaluating whether to adopt additional regulatory requirements. For example, the EPA has commenced a multi-year study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. A draft of this report is expected in 2015 and a final, peer reviewed report is expected in 2016. In addition, in 2011, the EPA announced its intention to propose regulations under the federal Clean Water Act to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production. Proposed rules are expected in early 2015. The EPA also has issued guidance for issuing underground injection permits for hydraulic fracturing operations that use diesel fuel under the agency\u2019s Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) authority. This guidance could encourage other regulatory authorities to adopt more stringent to permitting and other restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing. The U.S. Department of the Interior, moreover, has proposed new rules for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands that, in general, would cover disclosure of fracturing fluid components, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. The rule is in its final stages and the BLM is expected to issue a final rule in 2015. The BLM is also expected to consider implementing rules addressing venting and flaring on\nBLM land. And the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, which would apply to use of sand as a proppant for hydraulic fracturing.\nIn the United States Congress, bills have been introduced that would amend the SDWA to eliminate an existing exemption for certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of \u201cunderground injection,\u201d thereby requiring the oil and natural gas industry to obtain SDWA permits for fracturing not involving diesel fuels, and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the process. If adopted, such legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal level, but some form of chemical disclosure is already required by most oil and gas producing states. At this time, it is not clear what action, if any, the United States Congress will take on hydraulic fracturing.\nApart from these ongoing federal initiatives, state governments where we operate have moved to impose stricter requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of oil and gas production. Colorado, for example, comprehensively updated its oil and gas regulations in 2008 and adopted significant additional amendments in 2011 and 2014. Among other things, the updated and amended regulations require operators to reduce methane emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, compile and report additional information regarding well bore integrity, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, increase the minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, implement additional groundwater testing and incur increased monetary penalties for violations of the State\u2019s oil and gas conservation commission rules and regulations. Similarly, in February 2015, a task force created by the State of Colorado aimed at making recommendations for minimizing land use and other conflicts concerning the location of new oil and gas facilities agreed upon 9 consensus proposals which are being sent to Governor Hickenlooper for his review. Three of the proposals require further legislative action, while the other 6 proposals require rulemaking or other regulatory action. The proposals support (i) a senate bill that would postpone expiration of recently adopted regulations regarding air emissions; (ii) tasking the COGCC with crafting new rules related to siting of \u201clarge-scale\u201d pads and facilities; (iii) requiring the industry to provide advance information about development plans to local governments; (iv) improving the COGCC\u2019s local government liaison and designee programs; (v) adding 11 full-time staffers to the COGCC to improve inspections and field operations; (vi) bolstering the inspection staff and equipment for monitoring oil and gas facility air emissions and setting up a hotline for citizen health complaints at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; (vii) creating a statewide oil and gas information clearinghouse; (viii) studying ways to ameliorate the impact of oil and gas truck traffic and (ix) creating a compliance-assistance program at the COGCC to help operators comply with the state's changing rules and ensure consistent enforcement of rules by state inspectors. A number of additional proposals did not receive sufficient task force support to be included with the 9 consensus proposals, but may nevertheless be forwarded to the Governor as well.\nEven local governments are adopting new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Some counties in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. Voters in the cities of Fort Collins, Boulder and Lafayette, Colorado recently approved bans of varying length on hydraulic fracturing within their respective city limits. The bans in Longmont, Lafayette and Fort Collins were overturned by local district courts; the Boulder and Broomfield bans remain in place and the Boulder County moratorium was recently extended until 2018. The Longmont City Council has appealed the district court\u2019s decision to overturn the ban and Fort Collins is appealing that court decision as well. While these initiatives cover areas with little recent or ongoing oil and gas development, they could lead opponents of hydraulic fracturing to push for statewide referendums, especially in Colorado. For example, in the wake of successful local bans, the State of New York recently placed a permanent moratorium on all hydraulic fracturing operations within the state.\nThe adoption of future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products and services. We cannot assure you that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThere is a growing belief that human-caused (anthropogenic) emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services and the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to potential changes in both costs and weather patterns).\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and welfare, because such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Consistent with its findings, the EPA has proposed or adopted various regulations under the Clean Air Act to address GHGs. Among other things, the EPA began limiting emissions of GHGs from new cars and light duty trucks beginning with the 2012 model year. In addition, in 2010 the EPA published a final rule to address the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or \u201cPSD,\u201d and Title V permitting programs. Under this rule, the EPA imposed certain GHG permitting requirements on the largest major sources first. As noted above, in June 2014, the United States Supreme Court invalidated part of the EPA\u2019s stationary source GHG program in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, No. 12-1146. Specifically, the Supreme Court ruled that major sources subject to the PSD or Title V programs because of non-GHG emissions could potentially be still subject to certain \u201cbest available control technology\u201d requirements applicable to their GHG emissions. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, sources subject to the PSD or Title V programs due solely to their GHG emissions can no longer be subject to EPA\u2019s GHG permitting requirements. The EPA also adopted regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specific categories of higher GHG emitting sources in the United States, including certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which include certain of our operations, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. Information in such report may form the basis for further GHG regulation. Further, the EPA has announced a comprehensive strategy for further reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations, with a proposed rule expected in 2015 and a final rule in 2016. The EPA\u2019s GHG rules could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities.\nMoreover, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs or promote the use of renewable fuels. As an alternative, some proponents of GHG controls have advocated mandating a national \u201cclean energy\u201d standard. In 2011, for example, President Obama encouraged Congress to adopt a goal of generating 80% of U.S. electricity from \u201cclean energy\u201d by 2035 with credit for renewable and nuclear power and partial credit for clean coal and \u201cefficient natural gas.\u201d In the absence of such a comprehensive federal legislative program expressly addressing GHGs, the EPA recently proposed rules known as the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d designed to decrease GHG emissions, primarily from electric generating power plants. A final rule for both new and existing power plants under the Clean Power Plan is expected in 2015. We are unable to predict how, or if, the Clean Power Plan will affect our operations.\nIn the meantime, many states already have taken such measures, which have included renewable energy standards, development of GHG emission inventories or cap and trade programs. Cap and trade programs typically work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of available allowances reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms and floods. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. Our insurance may not cover some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional drilling locations and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory drilling locations or to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of unsuccessful drilling attempts, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to retain our existing senior management or technical personnel or attract qualified new personnel, such failure could adversely affect our operations.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management, technical personnel, or any of the vice presidents of the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, competition for experienced senior management, technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nWe recorded substantial stock-based compensation expense in 2014, and we are likely to incur additional stock-based compensation expense related to our future grants of stock, which may impact our operating results for the foreseeable future.\nWe incurred stock-based compensation expense in 2014 in the amount of $20.7 million, of which $7.6 million related to executive departures, compared to $12.6 million in 2013. Our compensation expenses are likely to increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our stock-based incentive plans. These additional expenses will adversely affect our net income. We cannot determine the actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses at this time, because applicable accounting practices generally require that they be based on the fair market value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant; however, we expect them to be significant. We will recognize expenses for restricted stock and stock option awards we grant generally over the vesting period of such awards.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including collars and fixed-price swaps. We have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u00b7\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u00b7\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations; or\n\u00b7\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received.\nIn addition, these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nCurrent or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, establishes, among other provisions, federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes margin requirements and certain transaction clearing and trade execution requirements. On October 18, 2011, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) approved regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets, which were successfully challenged in federal district court by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and largely vacated by the court. The CFTC has filed a notice of appeal with respect to this ruling. Under CFTC final rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act, we believe our derivatives activity will qualify for the non-financial, commercial end-user exception, which exempts derivatives intended to hedge or mitigate commercial risk from the mandatory swap clearing requirement. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require us to comply with margin requirements in our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivative as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may be more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, business prospects and our ability to make payment on our Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $500 million of outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (\u201c6.75% Senior Notes\u201d), $300 million of outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (\u201c5.75% Senior Notes\u201d and, together with the 6.75% Senior Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), $33 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $2.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, but may seek additional debt financing. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u00b7\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy generally;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to access capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nplace restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u00b7\nmake it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our indebtedness under any revolving credit facility may vary with prevailing interest rates;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes or other debt and increase the risks that we may default on our debt obligations.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.\nOur ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, including a minimum current ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nissue preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase or redeem our subordinated debt;\n\u00b7\nmake certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u00b7\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nengage in certain business activities.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. We would not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes. Our ability to comply with the financial ratios and financial condition tests under our revolving credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility are limited by our borrowing base, which is subject to periodic redetermination.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is redetermined at least semi-annually, and up to one additional time between scheduled determinations upon request of the Company or lenders holding 662/3% of the aggregate commitments. Redeterminations are based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition, our lenders have substantial flexibility to reduce our borrowing base due to subjective factors. Upon a redetermination, we could be required to repay a portion of our bank debt to the extent our outstanding borrowings at such time exceed the redetermined borrowing base. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments, which could result in a default under the terms of the facility and an acceleration of the loans thereunder requiring us to negotiate renewals, arrange new financing or sell significant assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies, refineries and affiliates. We had approximately $54.6 million in receivables from oil and gas sales at December 31, 2014.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. This concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk since these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales to Plains Marketing LP, Lion Oil Trading & Transport, Inc. and High Sierra Crude Oil & Marketing accounted for approximately 29%, 19% and 11%, respectively, of our total sales. We do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that may result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local taxes, and may become subject to new taxes and certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe federal, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell, and, for many of our wells, sales and use taxes on significant portions of our drilling and operating costs. Many states have raised state taxes on energy sources or state taxes associated with the extraction of hydrocarbons and additional increases may occur. In addition, there has been a significant amount of discussion by legislators and presidential administrations concerning a variety of energy tax proposals.\nThere have been proposals for legislative changes that, if enacted into law, would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. Any such changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions within the industry that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nChanges to federal tax deductions, as well as any changes to or the imposition of new state or local taxes (including production, severance or similar taxes) could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption or financial loss.\nThe oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing and distribution activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data. Pipelines, refineries, power stations and distribution points for both fuels and electricity are becoming more interconnected by computer systems. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. Our technologies, systems, networks and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Given the politically sensitive nature of hydraulic fracturing and the controversy generated by its opponents, our technologies, systems and networks may be of particular interest to certain groups with political agendas, which may seek to launch cyber-attacks as a method of promoting their message. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business parties, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct our oil and gas exploration and development activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe do not intend to pay, and we are currently prohibited from paying, dividends on our common stock and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment is if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we are currently prohibited from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility and our Senior Notes. Consequently, our stockholders\u2019 only opportunity to achieve a return on their investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates, which may not occur, and the stockholders sell their shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock will ever exceed the price that the stockholders paid.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and our stock price could decline.\nThe trading price of shares of our common stock has from time to time fluctuated widely and in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations. As an example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, the sales price of our common stock ranged from a low of $16.36 per share to a high of $62.94 per share. The trading price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, our operating results, changes in our earnings estimates, additions or departures of key personnel, our financial condition, drilling activities, legislative and regulatory changes, general conditions in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, general economic conditions, and general conditions in the securities markets. In particular, a significant or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect our sales price of our common stock. Other risks described in this annual report could also materially and adversely affect our share price.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock. If an active public market for our common stock does not continue, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or \"float\" for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock\nmarket as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership in us.\nIf our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock, regardless of the actual plans of our existing stockholders. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Alberta, in her own capacity and as trustee/nominee for certain Alberta pension clients (\u201cHMQ\u201d), owns 7,587,859 shares, or approximately 15% of our total outstanding shares. HMQ is party to a registration rights agreement with us (the \u201cHMQ Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the HMQ Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to effect the registration of shares held by HMQ if it so requests or if we conduct other registrations of our common stock. In addition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock or substantially similar securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, our stockholders may be further diluted by future issuances under our equity incentive plans.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, even if such acquisition or merger may be in our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors, so that only approximately one- third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.\nAlberta Investment Management Corporation (\u201cAIMCO\u201d) may be deemed to beneficially own or control 15% of our common stock, potentially giving it influence over corporate transactions and other matters. Its interests and the interests of the parties on whose behalf it invests may conflict with our other stockholders, and the concentration of ownership of our common stock by such stockholders will limit the influence of other public stockholders.\nAIMCo, a Canadian corporation and investment manager to HMQ and certain Alberta pension funds, may be deemed to beneficially own, control or have influence over approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock. West Face Capital and AIMCo, on behalf of HMQ and certain Alberta pension funds, have entered into an investment management agreement pursuant to which West Face Capital has the right to vote the shares of our common stock held by HMQ. Accordingly, West Face may attempt to exert influence over our board of directors and the outcome of stockholder votes. Even if the investment management agreement between West Face Capital and AIMCo were to be terminated, AIMCo, on behalf of HMQ, could have the ability to exert influence over the Company. Other than the HMQ Registration Rights Agreement, there are no contractual relationships or other understanding between the Company and HMQ or AIMCo.\nA concentration of beneficial ownership in AIMCo or West Face Capital could allow such stockholders to influence, directly or indirectly and subject to applicable law, significant matters affecting us, including the following:\n\u00b7\nestablishment of business strategy and policies;\n\u00b7\namendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u00b7\nnomination and election of directors;\n\u00b7\nappointment and removal of officers;\n\u00b7\nour capital structure; and\n\u00b7\ncompensation of directors, officers and employees and other employee- related matters.\nSuch a concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control, a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination, and could discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which could in turn have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13116, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BCEI"}
