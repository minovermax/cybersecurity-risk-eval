RISK FACTORS\nOur investors should consider the following risks that could affect us and our business. Although we have tried to identify key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Investors should consider carefully the following discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d which are included in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected adversely, and could further affect adversely, our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to global and regional economic disruption, volatility in the financial markets and a weakened commodity price environment. The outbreak and government measures taken in response, including extended quarantines, closures and reduced operations of businesses had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our business and the economy.\nUncertainty remains regarding the duration of global impacts due to COVID-19. This uncertainty, and the occurrence of these events and measures taken in response, could further affect adversely our results of operations by, among other things, reducing demand for the services we provide, impacting our supply chains and the availability and efficiency of our workforce, creating operational challenges and impacting our ability to access capital markets. The degree to which the pandemic further impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the success of vaccination efforts and the effectiveness of such vaccines against future mutations of the COVID-19 virus, how quickly and to what extent economic and operating conditions resume to pre-COVID-19 levels, and the severity and duration of reduced global and regional economic activity resulting from the pandemic.\nIf the level of drilling in the regions in which we operate declines substantially near our assets, our volumes and revenues could decline.\nOur gathering and transportation pipeline systems are dependent upon production from natural gas and crude oil wells, which naturally declines over time. As a result, our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and the asset utilization rates at our processing and fractionation facilities, we must continually obtain new supplies. Our ability to maintain or expand our businesses depends largely on the level of drilling and production by third parties in the regions in which we operate. Our natural gas and NGL supply volumes may be impacted if producers curtail or redirect drilling and production activities. Drilling and production are impacted by factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022demand and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022producers\u2019 access to capital;\n\u2022producers\u2019 finding and development costs of reserves;\n\u2022producers\u2019 desire and ability to obtain necessary permits, drilling rights and surface access in a timely manner and on reasonable terms;\n\u2022crude oil and associated natural gas field characteristics and production performance; and\n\u2022capacity constraints and/or shut downs on the pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from producing areas and our facilities.\nCommodity prices have experienced significant volatility. Drilling and production activity levels may vary across our geographic areas; however, a prolonged period of low commodity prices may reduce drilling and production activities across all areas. If we are not able to obtain new supplies to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition, throughput on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and the utilization rates of our processing and fractionation facilities would decline, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our ability to pay cash dividends.\nOur operating results may be affected adversely by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nIn addition to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, an adverse change in economic conditions worldwide or in the economic regions in which we operate could negatively affect the crude oil and natural gas markets, as well as in the specific segments in which we operate, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our services and products. Our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region. Volatility in commodity prices may have an impact on many of our suppliers and customers, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us. Periods of severe volatility in equity and credit markets may disrupt our access to such markets, make it difficult to obtain financing necessary to expand facilities or acquire assets, increase financing costs and result in the imposition of restrictive financial covenants. If adverse global or regional economic and market conditions remain uncertain or persist, spread or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe volatility of natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices could affect adversely our earnings and cash flows.\nLower commodity prices could reduce crude oil, natural gas and NGL production which could decrease the demand for our services. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of commodities that are received in conjunction with natural gas gathering and processing services, the transportation and storage of natural gas, and from the purchase and sale of NGLs and NGL products. As commodity prices decline, we could be paid less for our commodities thereby reducing our cash flows. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and can change quickly. For example, in March 2020, unsuccessful negotiations between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia regarding crude oil production cuts resulted in a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. As a result, the global supply of crude oil significantly exceeded demand and led to a collapse in crude oil prices. It is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe prices we receive for our commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022overall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u2022relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, domestic and foreign energy;\n\u2022market uncertainty;\n\u2022geopolitical conditions impacting supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022production decisions by other countries, such as the failure of countries to abide by recent agreements to reduce production volumes;\n\u2022the availability and cost of third-party transportation, natural gas processing and fractionation capacity;\n\u2022the level of consumer product demand and storage inventory levels;\n\u2022ethane rejection;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022speculation in the commodity futures markets;\n\u2022the effects of imports and exports on the price of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022the effect of worldwide energy-conservation measures;\n\u2022the impact of new supplies, new pipelines, processing and fractionation facilities on location price differentials; and\n\u2022technology and improved efficiency impacting supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil.\nThese external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of commodities and the impact commodity price fluctuations have on our customers and their need for our services, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters, including climate change, may impact our business.\nThere are increasing expectations that companies across all industries address ESG matters, including climate change. Changes in regulatory policies, public sentiment or widespread adoption of technologies that aim to address climate change through reducing GHG emissions may result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products, restrictions on their use or increased use of renewable energy. These changes could reduce the demand for our services, impacting our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn addition, increasing attention to climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental regulations, investigations, shareholder activism and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise affect adversely our business. For example, there are plans to propose new climate change disclosure requirements this year. While we do not know what form those requirements may take, we may face increased costs associated with complying with any new climate disclosure requirements.\nCertain investors are increasingly focused on ESG matters, including climate change. Further, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have also increased their focus on ESG matters and have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on various ESG initiatives. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us. Due to climate change concerns, some investors may choose to either not invest, or to reduce their investment, in companies that gather, process, fractionate, transport, store or market products derived from hydrocarbons. If this negative investor sentiment increases, we may see reduced demand for our securities, which could impact our liquidity or the value of our securities. Additionally, certain large institutional lenders have begun to announce their own policies to meet publicly announced climate commitments, which often involve commitments to shift lending activities in\nthe energy sector to meet GHG emissions goals. As a result, certain institutional lenders may impose additional requirements on us, or decide not to lend to us, based on ESG concerns, which could adversely affect our access to capital on reasonable terms or at all and, as a result, our financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of GHGs as a financial risk, this could also negatively affect our ability to access capital or cause us to receive less favorable terms and conditions in future financings.\nIn September 2021, we announced a 30% absolute GHG reduction target, or 2.2 million metric tons, of our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030, compared with 2019 base-year levels. To the extent that the potential pathways we have identified to achieve this emissions reduction target are not available to us, or to the extent we otherwise are unable to make progress toward other ESG-related targets we may establish, we may face additional costs to meet these targets, or we may fail to meet them entirely, which could negatively impact our business and reputation.\nWe may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.\nThe threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. Some of our customers\u2019 energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition, through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. Severe weather impacts our operating territories primarily through hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados, freezing temperatures and snow or ice storms. To the extent the severity or frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing services, including the cost of insurance, and decrease the availability of certain insurance coverages. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, which could affect adversely our business and for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the operation of natural gas and NGL gathering, transportation and distribution pipelines, storage facilities and processing and fractionation facilities, which include, but are not limited to, leaks, pipeline ruptures, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and the performance of facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency. Other operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions include adverse weather conditions, infectious disease including a pandemic, cybersecurity attacks, geopolitical reactions, accidents, explosions, fires, the collision of equipment with our pipeline facilities (for example, this may occur if a third party were to perform excavation or construction work near our facilities) and catastrophic events such as tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other similar events beyond our control. Extreme cold weather can result in supply reductions from producer wellhead freeze-offs, as well as power curtailments or outages, any of which can negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Further, the United States government warned that energy assets, specifically the nation\u2019s pipeline infrastructure, may be targets of terrorist attacks. An act of terrorism could target our facilities, those of our suppliers or customers or those of other pipelines. A casualty occurrence may result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Liabilities incurred and interruptions to the operations of our pipeline or other facilities caused by such an event could reduce our revenues and increase expenses, thereby impairing our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consequently, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or purchase other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost, and we are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Further, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner.\nContinued development of supply sources outside of our operating regions could impact demand for our services.\nProduction areas outside of our operating regions may compete with natural gas and NGL supply originating in production areas connected to our systems, which may cause natural gas and NGLs in supply areas connected to our systems to be diverted to markets other than our traditional market areas and may affect capacity utilization adversely on our pipeline systems and our ability to renew or replace existing contracts. In our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, the development of\nreserves could move drilling rigs from our current service areas to other areas, which may reduce demand for our services. In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, the displacement of natural gas originating in supply areas connected to our pipeline systems by supply sources that are closer to the end-use markets could reduce demand for our services. Either of these possibilities could result in lower revenues, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe do not hedge fully against commodity price risk or interest rate risk, including commodity price changes, seasonal price differentials, product price differentials or location price differentials. This could result in decreased revenues, increased costs and lower margins, affecting adversely our results of operations.\nCertain of our businesses are exposed to market risk and the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss of future cash flows and earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity prices. Our primary commodity price exposures arise from:\n\u2022the value of the commodities sold under fee with POP contracts of which we retain a portion of the sales proceeds;\n\u2022the price differentials between the individual NGL products with respect to our NGL transportation and fractionation agreements;\n\u2022the location price differentials in the price of natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the seasonal price differentials in natural gas and NGLs related to our storage operations;\n\u2022the price risk related to electric costs to operate our facilities; and\n\u2022the fuel costs and the value of the retained fuel in-kind in our natural gas pipelines and storage operations.\nTo manage the risk from market price fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and electricity prices, we may use derivative instruments such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. However, we do not hedge fully against commodity price changes, and we therefore retain some exposure to market risk. Further, hedging instruments that are used to reduce our exposure to interest-rate fluctuations could expose us to risk of financial loss where we may contract for fixed-rate swap instruments to hedge variable-rate instruments and the fixed rate exceeds the variable rate. Finally, hedging arrangements for forecasted sales and purchases are used to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive if market prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs differ from the stated price in the hedge instrument for these commodities.\nA breach of information security, including a cybersecurity attack, or failure of one or more key information technology or operational systems, or those of third parties, may affect adversely our operations, financial results or reputation.\nOur businesses are dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. The various uses of these information technology systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022controlling our plants and pipelines with industrial control systems including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition;\n\u2022collecting and storing customer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and data;\n\u2022processing transactions;\n\u2022summarizing and reporting results of operations;\n\u2022hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;\n\u2022complying with regulatory, legal, financial or tax requirements;\n\u2022providing data security; and\n\u2022other processes necessary to manage our business.\nIf any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could affect adversely our business and results of operations. Our financial results could also be affected adversely if an individual causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nDue to increased technology advances and an increase in remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. We use software to help manage and operate our businesses, and this may subject us to increased risks. According to experts, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a rise in the number and sophistication of cyberattacks on companies\u2019 network and information systems by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations, and as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to\nincrease. A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption in our systems, or those of our vendors, could result in a disruption of our operations, physical or environmental damages, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues. If any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in our information systems and networks or those of our vendors, including personnel, customer and vendor information, we could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. Efforts by us and our vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in anticipating, detecting or preventing these events from occurring, and any network and information systems-related events could require us to expend significant resources to identify, assess and remedy such events. Cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access and to identify and appropriately report cyberattacks, remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, including sufficient insurance, as cyberthreats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nCyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations or contractual obligations. Current efforts by the federal government, such as the Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity executive order, and the TSA security directives issued in May and July 2021, have utilized significant internal and external resources, and any potential future statutes, regulations or orders could lead to further increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage costs or capital expenditures. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business resulting from additional regulations.\nGrowing our business by constructing new pipelines and facilities or making modifications to our existing facilities subjects us to construction risk and supply risks, should adequate natural gas or NGL supply be unavailable upon completion of the facilities.\nTo expand our business, we regularly construct new and modify or expand existing pipelines and gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities. The construction and modification of these facilities may involve the following risks:\n\u2022projects may require significant capital expenditures, which may exceed our estimates, and involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and weather-related uncertainties;\n\u2022projects may increase demand for labor, materials and rights of way, which may, in turn, affect our costs and schedule;\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain new rights of way to connect new natural gas or NGL supplies to our existing gathering or transportation pipelines;\n\u2022if we undertake these projects, we may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the budgeted cost;\n\u2022our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project;\n\u2022we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize;\n\u2022opposition from environmental and social groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates could result in organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our construction activities or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the construction or operation of our assets; and\n\u2022we may be required to rely on third parties downstream of our facilities to have available capacity for our delivered natural gas or NGLs, which may not yet be operational.\nAs a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas or NGLs to achieve our expected investment return, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nEstimates of hydrocarbon reserves may be inaccurate, which could result in lower than anticipated volumes.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate hydrocarbon reserves and production volumes expected to be delivered to us for a variety of reasons, including the unavailability of sufficiently detailed information and unanticipated changes in producers\u2019 expected drilling schedules. Accordingly, we may not have accurate estimates of total reserves committed to our assets, the anticipated life of such reserves or the expected volumes to be produced from those reserves. In such event, if we are unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes that we gather, process, fractionate and transport in the future could be less than anticipated. A decline in such volumes could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, and we lease certain facilities and equipment, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of our pipelines and facilities are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the risk of increased costs to maintain necessary land use. We obtain the rights to construct and operate certain of our pipelines and related facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts on acceptable terms or increased costs to renew such rights, could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nMeasurement adjustments on our pipeline system may be impacted materially by changes in estimation, type of commodity and other factors.\nNatural gas and NGL measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our assets. The quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments are complicated by several factors including: (i) the significant quantities (i.e., thousands) of measurement equipment that we use across our natural gas and NGL systems, primarily around our gathering and processing assets; (ii) varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems and the mixed nature of NGLs gathered and fractionated; and (iii) variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies and standards. Each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that may occur on our systems, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn the competition for supply, we may have significant levels of excess capacity on our natural gas and NGL pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets.\nOur natural gas and NGL pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets compete with other pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage assets for natural gas and NGL supply delivered to the markets we serve. As a result of competition, we may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted capacity on our assets, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nMany of our assets have been in service for several decades.\nMany of our pipeline and storage assets are designed as long-lived assets. Over time the age of these assets could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures and an increased risk of product releases and associated costs and liabilities. Any significant increase in these expenditures, costs or liabilities could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay cash dividends.\nOur operating cash flows are derived partially from cash distributions we receive from our unconsolidated affiliates.\nOur operating cash flows are derived partially from cash distributions we receive from our unconsolidated affiliates, as discussed in Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. The amount of cash that our unconsolidated affiliates can distribute principally depends upon the amount of cash flows these affiliates generate from their respective operations, which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We do not have any direct control over the cash distribution policies of our unconsolidated affiliates. This lack of control may contribute to us not having sufficient available cash each quarter to continue paying dividends at the current levels.\nAdditionally, the amount of cash that we have available for cash dividends depends primarily upon our cash flows, including working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by noncash items such as depreciation, amortization and provisions for asset impairments. As a result, we may be able to pay cash dividends during periods when we record losses and may not be able to pay cash dividends during periods when we record net income.\nWe may be unable to cause our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of our joint-venture participants agree.\nWe participate in several joint ventures. Due to the nature of some of these arrangements, each participant in these joint ventures has made substantial investments in the joint venture and, accordingly, has required that the relevant charter documents contain certain features designed to provide each participant with the opportunity to participate in the management of the joint venture and to protect its investment, as well as any other assets that may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of that joint venture. These participation and protective features customarily include a corporate governance structure that requires at least a majority-in-interest vote to authorize many basic activities and requires a greater voting interest (sometimes up to 100%) to authorize more significant activities. Examples of these more significant activities\nare large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets, borrowing money or otherwise raising capital, transactions with affiliates of a joint-venture participant, litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business, among others. Thus, without the concurrence of joint-venture participants with enough voting interests, we may be unable to cause any of our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of us or the particular joint venture.\nMoreover, subject to contractual restrictions, any joint-venture owner generally may sell, transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture, whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint-venture owners. Any such transaction could result in us being required to partner with different or additional parties who may have business interests different from ours.\nWe do not operate all of our joint-venture assets nor do we employ directly all of the persons responsible for providing administrative, operating and management services. This reliance on others to operate joint-venture assets and to provide other services could affect adversely our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on others to provide administrative, operating and management services for certain of our joint-venture assets. We have a limited ability to control the operations and the associated costs of such operations. The success of these operations depends on a number of factors that are outside our control, including the competence and financial resources of the operator or an outsourced service provider. We may have to contract elsewhere for outsourced services, which may cost more than we are currently paying. In addition, we may not be able to obtain the same level or kind of service or retain or receive the services in a timely manner, which may impact our ability to perform under our contracts and affect adversely our business and results of operations.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO REGULATION\nIncreased regulation of exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, well setbacks and disposal of wastewater, could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new crude oil and natural gas wells.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is relying increasingly on supplies from nonconventional sources, such as shale and tight sands. Natural gas extracted from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing, which involves the pressurized injection of water, sand and chemicals into a geologic formation to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. Legislation or regulations placing restrictions on exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing and disposal of wastewater, could result in operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators. Any of these factors could reduce their production of unprocessed natural gas and, in turn, affect adversely our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas and NGLs gathered, treated, processed, fractionated and transported on our or our joint ventures\u2019 assets.\nOur business is subject to regulatory oversight and potential penalties.\nThe energy industry historically has been subject to heavy state and federal regulation that extends to many aspects of our businesses and operations, including:\n\u2022change to federal, state and local taxation;\n\u2022regulatory approval and review of certain of our rates, operating terms and conditions of service;\n\u2022the types of services we may offer our counterparties;\n\u2022construction and operation of new facilities;\n\u2022the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations;\n\u2022acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;\n\u2022reporting and information posting requirements;\n\u2022maintenance of accounts and records; and\n\u2022relationships with affiliate companies involved in all aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses.\nCompliance with these requirements can be costly and burdensome. Future changes to laws, regulations and policies in these areas may impair our ability to compete for business or to recover costs and may increase the cost and burden of our operations. We cannot guarantee that state or federal regulators will not challenge our safety practices or will authorize any projects or acquisitions that we may propose in the future. Moreover, there can be no guarantee that, if granted, any such authorizations will be made in a timely manner or will be free from potentially burdensome conditions.\nUnder the Natural Gas Act, which is applicable to our interstate natural gas pipelines, and the Interstate Commerce Act, which is applicable to our NGL pipelines, our interstate transportation rates are regulated by the FERC and many changes to our pipeline tariffs must be approved in a regulatory proceeding. Additionally, shippers, the FERC and/or state regulatory agencies may investigate our tariff rates which could result in, among other things, being ordered to reduce rates or make refunds to shippers.\nFailure to comply with all applicable state or federal statutes, rules and regulations and orders could bring substantial penalties and fines.\nWe may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of GHG emissions.\nGHG emissions originate primarily from combustion engine exhaust, heater exhaust and fugitive methane gas emissions. International, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit GHG emissions, including initiatives directed at issues associated with climate change. Various federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of GHGs, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation by the EPA. In addition, there have been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs.\nWe believe it is likely that future governmental legislation and/or regulation on the federal, state or regional level may require us either to limit GHG emissions associated with our operations, pay additional taxes or to purchase allowances for certain emissions. These legislative and/or regulatory initiatives could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations will take, the stringency of the regulations, when they will become effective or the impact on our capital expenditures, competitive position and results of operations. In addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. Further, we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to complying with GHG regulatory requirements. Our future results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be affected adversely if such costs are not recovered or otherwise passed on to our customers.\nOur operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. Increased litigation challenging oil and gas development and changes to laws, regulations and policies could impact adversely our business.\nThe risk of incurring substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our business. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into, or otherwise relating to the protection of, the environment. Examples of these laws include:\n\u2022the Clean Air Act and analogous state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions;\n\u2022the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws that regulate discharge of wastewater from our facilities into state and federal waters;\n\u2022the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and analogous state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent waste for disposal; and\n\u2022the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and analogous state laws that impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities.\nRecently, the EPA has proposed updating the New Source Performance Standards Subpart OOOO regulations to further reduce methane emissions, which includes increased monitoring frequency and more stringent repair requirements for new and modified oil and gas facilities. In addition, the EPA is proposing new nationwide emission guidelines for states to limit methane emissions from existing facilities. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business resulting from these additional regulations and guidelines.\nVarious federal and state governmental authorities, including the EPA, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under the CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas.\nThere is an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in our business due to our handling of the products we gather, transport, process and store, air emissions related to our operations, past industry operations and waste disposal\npractices, some of which may be material. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline systems pass, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing operations, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could increase significantly our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, some of which may be material. Additional information is included under Item 1, Business, under \u201cRegulatory, Environmental and Safety Matters\u201d and in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nIncreased litigation challenging oil and gas development, changes to laws, regulations and policies, as well as changes in regulators\u2019 interpretation or application of such laws, regulations and policies could impact our business. These actions could, among other things, impact our customers\u2019 activities, our existing permits and our ability to obtain permits for new development projects, which could affect adversely our business, financial position, or results of operations.\nOur insurance may not cover all environmental risks and has limits on coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us. Our business may be affected adversely by increased costs due to stricter pollution-control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New or revised environmental regulations might also affect adversely our products and activities, and federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, all of which could affect adversely our profitability.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO FINANCING OUR BUSINESS\nChanges in interest rates could affect adversely our business.\nWe use both fixed and variable rate debt, and we are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our short-term borrowings. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be affected adversely by significant fluctuations in interest rates from current levels.\nIn July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. However, in March 2021, the administrator of LIBOR, the ICE Benchmark Administration, announced all U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will continue to be published through June 2023, with the exception of one-week and two-month tenors, which ceased at the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Actions by the British Bankers Association, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority or other regulators or law enforcement agencies as a result of these or future events, may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR.\nAt this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although on July 29, 2021, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a U.S.-based steering committee composed of large US financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, formally recommended SOFR Term rates. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that is established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including how this will impact the cost of our variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments, or whether the COVID-19 pandemic will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. In addition, although financial institutions are increasingly utilizing SOFR in credit facilities, it is unknown whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR.\nOur $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement includes provisions that grant the administrative agent discretion to establish a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary, which could increase our short-term borrowing costs for amounts issued under this facility.\nAny reduction in our credit ratings could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur long-term debt has been assigned an investment-grade credit rating of \u201cBaa3\u201d by Moody\u2019s and \u201cBBB\u201d by both S&P and Fitch. Our commercial paper program has been assigned an investment-grade credit rating of Prime-3, A-2 and by Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch, respectively. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by these credit rating agencies. If these agencies were to downgrade our long-term debt or our commercial paper rating, particularly below investment grade, our\nborrowing costs could increase, which would affect adversely our financial results, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. Ratings from these agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nOur indebtedness and guarantee obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $13.6 billion. Our indebtedness and guarantee obligations could have significant consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to senior notes and other indebtedness due to the increased debt-service obligations, which could, in turn, result in an event of default on such other indebtedness or the senior notes;\n\u2022impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general business purposes;\n\u2022diminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to debt-service payments, reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have proportionately less debt and fewer guarantee obligations.\nWe are not prohibited under the indentures governing the senior notes from incurring additional indebtedness, but our debt agreements do subject us to certain operational limitations summarized in the next paragraph. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, it could worsen the negative consequences mentioned above and could affect adversely our ability to repay our other indebtedness.\nOur $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement contains provisions that, among other things, limit our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our business, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens or make negative pledges. It also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios, which limit the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur, as described in the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report. These restrictions could result in higher costs of borrowing and impair our ability to generate additional cash. Future financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt-service obligations or comply with financial covenants, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nAn event of default may require us to offer to repurchase certain of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 senior notes or may impair our ability to access capital.\nThe indentures governing certain of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 senior notes include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $15 million or more for certain of our senior notes or $100 million or more for certain of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 senior notes. Such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 outstanding senior notes to declare those senior notes immediately due and payable in full. We may not have sufficient cash on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause us to borrow money under our credit facility or seek alternative financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment. We could also face difficulties accessing capital or our borrowing costs could increase, impacting our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill our debt obligations.\nThe right to receive payments on our outstanding debt securities and subsidiary guarantees is unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness as well as to any existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes.\nAlthough ONEOK Partners and the Intermediate Partnership have guaranteed our debt securities, the guarantees are subject to release under certain circumstances, and we have subsidiaries that are not guarantors. In those cases, the debt securities effectively are subordinated to the claims of all creditors, including trade creditors and tort claimants, of our subsidiaries that\nare not guarantors. In the event of the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or winding up of the business of a subsidiary that is not a guarantor, creditors of that subsidiary would generally have the right to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us or the holders of the debt securities.\nA court may use fraudulent conveyance considerations to avoid or subordinate the cross guarantees of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 indebtedness.\nONEOK, ONEOK Partners and the Intermediate Partnership have cross guarantees in place for our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 indebtedness. A court may use fraudulent conveyance laws to subordinate or avoid the cross guarantees of certain of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 indebtedness. It is also possible that under certain circumstances, a court could avoid or subordinate the guarantor\u2019s guarantee of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 indebtedness in favor of the guarantor\u2019s other debts or liabilities to the extent that the court determined either of the following were true at the time the guarantor issued the guarantee:\n\u2022the guarantor incurred the guarantee with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its present or future creditors or the guarantor contemplated insolvency with a design to favor one or more creditors to the total or partial exclusion of others; or\n\u2022the guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonable equivalent value for issuing the guarantee and, at the time it issued the guarantee, the guarantor:\n- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the guarantee;\n- was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or\n- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing will vary depending upon the law of the relevant jurisdiction. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if:\n\u2022the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets at a fair valuation;\n\u2022the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u2022it could not pay its debts as they become due.\nAmong other things, a legal challenge of the cross guarantees of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 indebtedness on fraudulent conveyance grounds may focus on the benefits, if any, realized by the guarantor as a result of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 issuance of such debt. To the extent the guarantor\u2019s guarantee of our and ONEOK Partners\u2019 indebtedness is avoided as a result of fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of such debt would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nHolders of our common stock may receive dividends that vary from anticipated amounts, or no dividends at all.\nWe may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. The actual amount of cash we pay in the form of dividends may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our working capital needs, our ability to borrow, the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility, our debt service requirements and the cost of acquisitions, if any. A failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage and a decrease in the value of our stock price.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers or counterparties, and our credit-risk management may not be adequate to protect against such risk.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties. Our customers or counterparties may experience rapid deterioration of their financial condition as a result of changing market conditions, commodity prices or financial difficulties that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay us for our services. We assess the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and obtain collateral or contractual terms as we deem appropriate. We cannot, however, predict to what extent our business may be impacted by deteriorating market or financial conditions, including possible declines in our customers\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness. Our customers and counterparties may not perform or adhere to our existing or future contractual arrangements. To the extent our customers and counterparties are in financial distress or commence bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with them may be subject to\nrenegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. If our risk-management policies and procedures fail to assess adequately the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties, any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are connected to market areas located in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain, Permian Basin, Midwest markets, including Chicago, Illinois, and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. Our counterparties are primarily major integrated and independent exploration and production, pipeline, marketing and petrochemical companies and natural gas and electric utilities. Therefore, our counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other factors that may affect our overall credit risk.\nA shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs.\nOur operations require skilled and experienced workers with proficiency in multiple tasks. In recent years, a shortage of workers trained in various skills associated with the midstream energy business has, at times, caused us to conduct certain operations without full staff, thus hiring outside resources, which may decrease productivity and increase costs. This shortage of trained workers is the result of experienced workers reaching retirement age and increased competition for workers in certain areas, combined with the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry. This shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, it could affect adversely our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand operations in the event there is an increase in the demand for our services and products, which could affect adversely our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur employees or directors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nAs with all companies, we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Our Board of Directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers (including our principal executive and financial officers, principal accounting officer, controllers and other persons performing similar functions) and all other employees. We require all directors, officers and employees to adhere to our code of business conduct and ethics in addressing the legal and ethical issues encountered in conducting their work for our company. Our code of business conduct and ethics requires, among other things, that our directors, officers and employees avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all applicable laws and other legal requirements, conduct business in an honest and ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in our company\u2019s best interest. All directors, officers and employees are required to report any conduct that they believe to be an actual or apparent violation of our code of business conduct and ethics. However, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could affect adversely our reputation, business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAn impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity-method investments could reduce our earnings.\nGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. GAAP requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if a low commodity price environment persisted for a prolonged period, it could result in lower volumes delivered to our systems and impairments of our assets or equity-method investments. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by consolidated debt to total capitalization.\nFor further discussion of impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity-method investments, see Notes A, E, D and M, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nAcquisitions that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce our cash from operations on a per-share basis.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks that may include, among other things:\n\u2022inaccurate assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including potential synergies;\n\u2022an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022decrease in our liquidity as a result of our using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition;\n\u2022a significant increase in our interest expense and/or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance the acquisition;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified, our indemnity is inadequate or our insurance policies may exclude from coverage;\n\u2022an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets;\n\u2022limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas;\n\u2022increased regulatory burdens;\n\u2022customer or key employee losses at an acquired business; and\n\u2022increased regulatory requirements.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our resources to future acquisitions.\nThe cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits to eligible employees and qualified retirees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics and may increase.\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and former employees, which closed to new participants in 2005, and postretirement welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees hired prior to 2017 who retire with at least five years of full-time service. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of plan participants and their beneficiaries and changes in health care costs. For further discussion of our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement welfare plans, see Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nAny sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields may affect adversely the value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets. In these circumstances, additional cash contributions to our pension plans may be required, which could affect adversely our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report accurately our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential holders of our equity and debt securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We cannot be certain that our efforts to maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to continue to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our equity, our access to capital markets and the cost of capital.", "PERMNO": 25232, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "OKE"}
