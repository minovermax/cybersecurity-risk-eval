{"cik": "1429764", "company": "Car Charging Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business as they may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRelating to Our Business\nOur Revenue Growth Depends on Consumers\u2019 Willingness to Adopt Electric Vehicles.\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of electric vehicles (\u201cEV\u201d), and we are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for EVs. If the market for EVs does not gain broad market acceptance or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements, long development cycles for EV original equipment manufacturers, and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the purchase and use of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically EVs, include:\n\u25cf perceptions about EV quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of EVs;\n\u25cf the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge and concerns about running out of power while in use;\n\u25cf improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;\n\u25cf the environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u25cf volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the U.S. on oil from unstable or hostile countries and the impact of international conflicts;\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u25cf access to charging stations, standardization of EV charging systems and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an EV; and\n\u25cf the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles\nThe influence of any of the factors described above may negatively impact the widespread consumer adoption of EVs, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe Need Additional Capital to Fund Our Growing Operations and Cannot Assure You That We Will Be Able to Obtain Sufficient Capital on Reasonable Terms or at All, and We May Be Faced to Limit the Scope of Our Operations.\nWe need additional capital to fund our growing operations and if adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms or available at all, we may not be able to undertake expansion or continue our marketing efforts and we would have to modify our business plans accordingly. The extent of our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products and/or services by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in research and development; (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions; and (v) our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nEven if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are acceptable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.\nThe Report of Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Contains an Explanatory Paragraph That Expresses Substantial Doubt About Our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and for the year then ended indicates that our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The report states that, since we have incurred net losses since inception and we need to raise additional funds to meet our obligations and sustain our operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years then ended. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe Have a History of Significant Losses, and If We Do Not Achieve and Sustain Profitability, Our Financial Condition Could Suffer.\nWe have experienced significant net losses, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $7.7 million and $8.2 million the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and as of December 31, 2016 our accumulated deficit was $81.1 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability and our financial condition could suffer. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Whether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted. Unless such cash flow levels are achieved, we may need to borrow additional funds or sell debt or equity securities, or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe Have Applied To List Our Common Stock And Warrants on NASDAQ. We Can Provide No Assurance That Our Common Stock And Warrants Qualify to Be Listed, And if Listed, That Our Securities Will Continue to Meet The NASDAQ Listing Requirements. If We Fail to Comply With The Continuing Listing Standards of NASDAQ, Our Securities Could Be Delisted.\nOur ability to have our securities become listed on NASDAQ will require us to, among other items, improve our balance sheet, which we may be unable to accomplish. As of December 31, 2016, we had accumulated stockholders\u2019 deficiency of approximately $20.8 million, and our stockholders\u2019 deficiency may increase as a result of additional net losses in subsequent quarterly periods.\nWe can provide no assurance that our listing application will be approved, and that an active trading market for our common stock will develop and continue. If, after listing, we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, such as the corporate governance requirements, stockholder equity requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase common stock underlying the units when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nTo meet the requirements of NASDAQ, we may be required to restructure certain of our equity securities or satisfy certain liabilities through the issuance of additional equity securities. Our ability to restructure certain of our equity securities may require us to enter into new agreements with the applicable security holders, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms or at all. Any such agreement may result in the issuance of new securities or the modification of the rights of existing securities in a manner that may be dilutive to our common stock holders. In addition, NASDAQ has certain requirements that are beyond our control, such as financial requirements that are based on the trading price of our stock. If we are unable to meet the minimum financial eligibility of NASDAQ, we may be unable to list our stock. Moreover, it would prevent us from increasing liquidity in our shares of common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe Unavailability, Reduction or Elimination of Government Incentives Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition, Operating Results and Prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2016, government grants accounted for 10% of our revenues. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in diminished revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. This could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies for EV charging equipment. In the event such subsidies discontinue, our business outlook and financial conditions could be negatively impacted.\nIf We Are Unable to Keep Up With Advances in EV Technology, We May Suffer a Decline in Our Competitive Position.\nThe EV industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we are unable to keep up with changes in EV technology, our competitive position may deteriorate which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our EV charging stations and Blink Network software in order to continue to provide EV charging services with the latest technology. However, due to our limited cash resources, our efforts to do so may be limited. For example, the EV charging network that we acquired from ECOtality was originally funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d), which funding is no longer available to us. As a result, we may be unable to grow, maintain and enhance the network of charging stations that we acquired from ECOtality at the same rate and scale as ECOtality did prior to the acquisition or at levels comparable our current competitors. Any failure of our charging stations to compete effectively with other manufacturers\u2019 charging stations will harm our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe Need to Manage Growth in Operations to Realize Our Growth Potential and Achieve Our Expected Revenues, and Our Failure to Manage Growth Will Cause a Disruption of Our Operations Resulting in the Failure to Generate Revenue and an Impairment of Our Long-Lived Assets.\nIn order to take advantage of the growth that we anticipate in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand our marketing operations. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.\nIn order to achieve the above-mentioned targets, the general strategies of our Company are to maintain and search for hard-working employees who have innovative initiatives, as well as to keep a close eye on expansion opportunities through merger and/or acquisition.\nIf Our Estimates or Judgments Relating to Our Critical Accounting Policies Prove to Be Incorrect, Our Financial Condition And Results of Operations Could Be Adversely Affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our consolidated financial statements included herein. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets, pension and other post-retirement benefits, product warranty, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, valuation of common stock warrants, and share-based compensation. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe Face Risks Arising From Acquisitions.\nIn 2012 and 2013, we acquired certain assets from 350 Green and Beam Charging. We may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing clients of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions and other strategic transactions. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of 50% of the interests of the ECOtality Estate in April 2015, we issued certain shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which we believe constitute an exempt issuance as intended under agreements with certain of our investors as such shares (i) were issued to effectuate the strategic acquisition of ECOtality, and (ii) permit us, in our sole control, to settle these shares for cash at stated optional redemption dates, as opposed to a variable number of shares. However, there can be no assurance that our investors agree with our interpretation of our investment documents and won\u2019t pursue any of the potential remedies that may be available to them.\nWe Have Limited Insurance Coverage, and Any Claims Beyond Our Insurance Coverage May Result in Our Incurring Substantial Costs and a Diversion of Resources.\nWe hold employer\u2019s liability insurance generally covering death or work-related injury of employees. We hold public liability insurance covering certain incidents involving third parties that occur on or in the premises of our Company. We hold directors and officers liability insurance. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our senior management or key personnel, or business interruption insurance. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any claim for product liability, damage to our fixed assets or employee injuries. Any liability or damage to, or caused by, our facilities or our personnel beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nOur Future Success Depends, in Part, on the Performance and Continued Service of Our Officers.\nWe presently depend to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of our management team, which consists of Michael Calise (our CEO), Michael D. Farkas (our Executive Chairman), Andy Kinard (our President) and Ira Feintuch (our Chief Operating Officer). The loss of services of Mr. Calise, Mr. Farkas, Mr. Kinard or Mr. Feintuch could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Failure to maintain our management team could prove disruptive to our daily operations, require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Future Success Depends, in Part, on Our Ability to Attract and Retain Highly Qualified Personnel.\nOur future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We are in the process of building our management team. Among other positions, we need to hire a Chief Financial Officer with public company experience. Although Mr. Calise currently acts as our interim principal financial officer and our interim principal accounting officer, in November 2016 we hired a financial reporting consultant with public company experience. Although we intend to hire a permanent Chief Financial Officer soon, there is no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources to do so. Our accounting controls may continue to be deficient unless we obtain the services of an experienced Chief Financial Officer who can help us address material weaknesses. In addition, expansion of our business and the management and operation of our Company will require additional managers and employees with industry experience, and our success will be highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. As our industry continues to evolve, competition for skilled personnel with the requisite experience will be significant. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees.\nWe Are in an Intensely Competitive Industry and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Be Able to Compete with Our Competitors Who May Have Greater Resources.\nWe face strong competition from competitors in the EV charging services industry, including competitors who could duplicate our model. Many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources and other capabilities than us. In addition, there are very few barriers to entry into the market for our services. There can be no assurance, therefore, that any of our current and future competitors, many of whom may have far greater resources, will not independently develop services that are substantially equivalent or superior to our services. Therefore, an investment in our Company is very risky and speculative due to the competitive environment in which we may operate.\nOur competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications, past contract performance, geographic presence and price. Furthermore, many of our competitors may be able to utilize substantially greater resources and economies of scale to develop competing products and technologies, divert sales away from us by winning broader contracts or hire away our employees by offering more lucrative compensation packages. In the event that the market for EV charging stations expands, we expect that competition will intensify as additional competitors enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines. In order to secure contracts successfully when competing with larger, well-financed companies, we may be forced to agree to contractual terms that provide for lower aggregate payments to us over the life of the contract, which could adversely affect our margins. Our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results.\nWe Have Experienced Significant Customer Concentration in Recent Periods, And Our Revenue Levels Could Be Adversely Affected if Any Significant Customer Fails To Purchase Products From Us At Anticipated Levels.\nWe are subject to customer concentration risk as a result of our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The relative magnitude and the mix of revenue from our largest customers have varied significantly quarter to quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2016, certain customers have accounted for significant revenues, varying by period, to our Company. The loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe May Have Certain Liabilities Associated with the Assets of 350 Green.\nThe status of the assets of 350 Green, a former wholly-owned subsidiary, are uncertain and not within our control. We transferred the assets of 350 Green to a trust mortgage and 350 Green became a Variable Interest Entity (a \u201cVIE\u201d). We are in the process of periodically reevaluating the nature of our interests in 350 Green, including whether or not we have achieved full isolation of the assets and membership interests of 350 Green, ensuring that we could not be required to provide direct or indirect financial support to our former subsidiary or its creditors. If we are required to provide financial support to our former subsidiary or its creditors, it would adversely impact our working capital.\nIf a Third Party Asserts That We Are Infringing Upon Its Intellectual Property, Whether Successful or Not, It Could Subject Us to Costly and Time-Consuming Litigation or Expensive Licenses, and Our Business May Be Harmed.\nThe EV and EV charging industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have acquired from other companies proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Intellectual property infringement claims against us could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation with respect to these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute services that do not infringe.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.\nThe Success of Our Business Depends in Large Part on Our Ability to Protect and Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue with respect to our currently pending patent applications, in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any registered service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in EV-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nChanges to Federal, State or International Laws or Regulations Applicable To Our Company Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect government incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy, electric vehicles and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in diminished revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting our business could be enacted. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of management\u2019s attention. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are many federal, state and international laws that may affect our business, including measures to regulate charging systems, electric vehicles, and others. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are a number of significant matters under review and discussion with respect to government regulations which may affect the business we intend to enter and/or harm our customers, and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Ability to Use Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards May Be Limited.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $59 million. We generally are able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. These NOLs may be offset against future taxable income through 2035, if not utilized before that time. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). Section 382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change generally occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of persons) who own, have owned or are treated as owning, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our stock increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these persons over a three-year rolling period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that we may offset with NOLs. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs.\nThe rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Because of our numerous capital raises, uncertainty exists as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past or will undergo one as a result of the various transactions discussed herein or other future transactions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available or utilizable.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nIf We Fail to Establish and Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control, We May Not Be Able to Report Our Financial Results Accurately or Prevent Fraud. Any Inability to Report and File Our Financial Results Accurately and Timely Could Harm Our Reputation and Adversely Impact the Trading Price of Our Common Stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have also experienced complications reporting as a result of material weaknesses and have at times been delinquent in our reporting obligations. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the most recent period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2016 our internal controls over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d) were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:\n1. We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year ended December 31, 2016. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n2. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts our ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n3. We do not have personnel with sufficient experience with U.S. GAAP to address complex transactions.\n4. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non-financial and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.\n5. We have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting by our audit committee is ineffective. The audit committee has not provided adequate review of our SEC filings and consolidated financial statements and has not provided adequate supervision and review of our accounting personnel or oversight of the independent registered accounting firm\u2019s audit of our consolidated financial statement.\nWe have taken steps to remediate some of the weaknesses described above, including by engaging third party financial consultants with expertise in accounting for complex transactions and SEC reporting. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit.\nWe are Required to Register Under the Securities Act the Resale of Shares of Our Common Stock by a Number f Our Security Holders. Our Failure to Comply With Our Contractual Obligations and Timely Register the Resale of Any Shares of Our Common Stock Has Resulted in, and Will Result in, Among Other Things, the Payment of Liquidated Damages, And Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Ability to Raise Additional Funds Through Private Placements in The Future And Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business.\nWe have entered into various agreements with purchasers of our securities from time to time which require us to register under the Securities Act the resale of shares of our common stock that we have issued or will be required to issue to such purchasers. We have failed to perform our obligations under these agreements and have accrued registration rights penalties, inclusive of accrued interest, in an aggregate amount equal to $1,163,033 as of December 31, 2016. The payment of these penalties will adversely impact our working capital.\nOur failure to comply with our contractual obligations and timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock for any reason, including as a result of any unexpected delay in the completion of any offering, may result in additional breaches of the agreements with certain security holders and in the payment of liquidated damages as required under the terms of our agreements with certain security holders. Any additional issuances of securities to these purchasers will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. In addition, our failure to timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock may result in reputational harm for our Company and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds through private placements in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are Required to Enable Some of our Shareholders to Sell Shares of Our Common Stock Pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Our Failure to Comply With Our Contractual Obligations and Enable Such Sales Has Resulted in, and Will Result in, Among Other Things, the Payment of Liquidated Damages, And Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Ability to Raise Additional Funds Through Private Placements in The Future And Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business.\nWe have entered into various agreements with purchasers of our securities from time to time which require us to enable sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act by filing our 10-Ks and 10-Qs in a timely fashion. Until we became current in our filings in August 2016, we had failed to perform our obligations under these agreements and have accrued public information failure rights penalties in an aggregate amount equal to $3,005,277, inclusive of accrued interest as of December 31, 2016. The payment of these penalties will adversely impact our working capital.\nOur failure to comply with our contractual obligations and timely file our 10-Qs and 10-Ks, may result in additional breaches of the agreements with certain security holders and in the payment of liquidated damages as required under the terms of our agreements with certain security holders. Any additional issuances of securities to these purchasers will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. In addition, our failure to timely file our 10-Qs and 10-Ks may result in reputational harm for our Company and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds through private placements in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Common Stock Is Currently Quoted Only on the OTC Pink Current Information Marketplace (\u201cOTC Pink\u201d), Which May Have an Unfavorable Impact on Our Stock Price and Liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink. The OTC Pink is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Pink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result, holders of our securities may not find purchasers for our securities should they to desire to sell them. Consequently, our securities should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite period of time.\nShares of Our Common Stock Which May Be Issued Upon Conversion of Indebtedness by JMJ May Dilute the Ownership Interests of Our Stockholders.\nOn October 7, 2016, we executed a convertible promissory note in favor of JMJ Financial, a Nevada sole proprietorship (\u201cJMJ\u201d) in the amount up to $3,725,000 bearing interest on the unpaid balance at the rate of six percent. The initial amount borrowed under the note was $500,000, with the remaining amounts permitted to be borrowed under the note being subject to us achieving certain milestones. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock based on the lesser of a per share price of $0.70 or 60% of the lowest trade prices in the 25 trading days prior to the date of conversion. If JMJ elects to convert the principal balance of its convertible note into shares of our common stock under the terms of the note, our current stockholders would be subject to dilution of their interests. Pursuant to the terms of the note, JMJ has agreed that it will not convert the note into more than 9.99% of our outstanding shares. JMJ currently does not own any shares of our common stock. On the fifth (5th) trading day after the pricing of our contemplated public offering, but in no event later than May 15, 2017, we will deliver to JMJ shares of our common stock (\u201cOrigination Shares\u201d) equal to 48% of the consideration paid by JMJ under the note divided by the lowest of (i) $0.70 per share, or (ii) the lowest daily closing price of the Issuer\u2019s common stock during the ten days prior to delivery of the Origination Shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits), or (iii) 80% of the common stock offering price of our contemplated public offering, or (iv) 80% of the unit price offering price of our contemplated public offering (if applicable), or (v) the exercise price of any warrants issued in the Public Offering.\nIn addition, a number of events of default under the JMJ Promissory Note have occurred. As of March 23, 2017, however, JMJ had not sought any remedies or assessed any fees for such events of default. On March 23, 2017, the parties amended the terms of the note such that JMJ agreed to conditionally waive the defaults solely with regards to our failure to meet the original maturity date of the note and the original delivery date for the Origination Shares note (February 15, 2017), but JMJ did not waive any damages, fees, penalties, liquidated damages, or other amounts or remedies otherwise resulting from such defaults (which damages, fees, penalties, liquidated damages, or other amounts or remedies JMJ may choose in the future to assess, apply or pursue in its sole discretion) and JMJ\u2019s conditional waiver is conditioned on us not being in default of and not breaching any term of the note or the securities purchase agreement at any time subsequent to March 23, 2017.\nWe initially issued one warrant to JMJ to purchase a total of 714,285 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the lesser of: (i) 80% of the per share price of the common stock in our contemplated public offering, (ii) $0.70 per share, (iii) 80% of the unit price in a public offering (if applicable), (iv) the exercise price of any warrants issued in such public offering, or (v) the lowest conversion price, exercise price, or exchange price, of any security issued by us that is outstanding on October 13, 2016.\nThe initial amount borrowed under the note was $500,000, with the remaining amounts permitted to be borrowed under the note being subject to us achieving certain milestones. With the achievement of certain milestones in November 2016, an additional advance of $500,000 occurred on November 28, 2016. Another warrant to purchase 714,285 shares of our common stock was issued as of November 28, 2016. The aggregate exercise price of the two warrants issued through November 28, 2016 is $1,000,000.\nWith the achievement of certain milestones in February 2017, additional advances of $225,100 and $300,000 occurred on, respectively, February 10, 2017 and February 27, 2017. Thus, two more warrants to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock were issued, one for 321,571 shares and the other for 428,571 shares, respectively. With the achievement of certain milestones in March 2017, additional advances of $250,000 and $30,000 occurred on March 14, 2017 and March 24, 2017, respectively, and two more warrants to purchase the Company's common stock were issued, one for 357,143 shares and the other for 42,857 shares. With the achievement of certain milestones in April 2017, an additional advance of $400,000 occurred on April 5, 2017 and another warrant to purchase 571,428 shares of our common stock was issued on the same date. To date, seven warrants to purchase a total of 3,150,140 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock have been issued to JMJ.\nThe conversion of the foregoing notes and warrant issued to JMJ, in addition to any other outstanding options, warrants, convertible notes, as well as potential future transactions, would result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective holders of our common stock.\nOur Shares of Common Stock Are Very Thinly Traded, and the Price May Not Reflect Our Value and There Can Be No Assurance That There Will Be an Active Market for Our Shares of Common Stock Either Now or in the Future.\nOur shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to increase awareness of our Company with investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for loans.\nWe Have a Significant Number of Shares of Our Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion of Certain Outstanding Debt Obligations and Convertible Preferred Stock, and The Issuance of Such Shares Upon Conversion Will Have a Dilutive Impact On Our Stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 27,500,000, 3,660,778 and 21,489,429 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series A, Series B and Series C Preferred Stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase a total of 62,217,405 shares of our common stock consisting of (i) 54,755,740 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $0.88; and (ii) 7,461,665 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options with a weighted average exercise price of $1.16. We also had outstanding convertible debt convertible into 816,580 shares of our common stock.\nFuture Issuance of Our Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants Could Dilute the Interests of Existing Stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock, options and warrants in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock, options and warrants could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock or preferred stock in the public market, or the exercise of a substantial number of warrants and options either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe Have Established Preferred Stock Which Can Be Designated By The Board and Have Established Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, Which Give The Holders Thereof a Liquidation Preference and The Ability to Convert Such Shares Into Our Common Stock.\nWe have 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, which includes 20,000,000 shares of designated Series A Preferred Stock of which 11,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding, 10,000 designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock, of which 8,250 shares are issued and outstanding and 250,000 designated shares of Series C Preferred Stock, of which 150,426 shares are issued and outstanding. The Series A Preferred Stock does not have a liquidation preference so long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share, which is pari passu to the liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock and payable prior to the liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate or sell our assets, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock would not have the right to receive any proceeds from any such transaction, holders of our Series B Preferred Stock would have the right to receive up to approximately $825,000 from any such transaction, and the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock would have the right to receive up to $16,192,700 from any such transaction, but before any amount is paid to the holders of our common stock. The payment of the liquidation preferences could result in common stockholders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\nAdditionally, the existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control. Furthermore, the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock into common stock may cause substantial dilution to our common stockholders. Because our Board is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of our stockholders, subject to NASDAQ rules and regulations, our stockholders will have no control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock, if any, will have. In addition, we may be required to redeem any non-converted shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of $100 per share, plus accrued dividends; and (b) Series B Preferred Stock at the rate of $100 per share, which funds we may not have, or which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe Have Outstanding Shares of Preferred Stock With Rights And Preferences Superior to Those of Our Common Stock.\nThe issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock grant the holders of our preferred stock certain anti-dilution, voting, dividend and liquidation rights that are superior to those held by the holders of our common stock. In March 2016, we issued Series C Preferred Stock, which grants the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock anti-dilution, voting, dividend, redemption, liquidation and other contractual rights that are superior to those held by the holders of our common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are contained in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on December 23, 2014 (the \u201cSeries C Certificate of Designation\u201d).\nThe issuance of shares of common stock in the future, issuances or deemed issuances of additional shares of common stock for a price below the applicable preferred stock conversion price will have the effect of diluting current stockholders. The rights of our preferred stockholders may increase our net losses, dilute our common stockholders, and allow such preferred stockholders to have approval rights and therefore to exert influence over certain corporate actions. For example, the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to certain dividend, liquidation preference, and anti-dilution rights that are described in the Series C Certificate of Designation and the related securities purchase agreement dated as of March 11, 2016, as filed with the SEC. In addition, the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock have certain redemption rights that may be exercised after December 2016 and, if such rights are exercised, could adversely affect our business and could require us to consider a range of strategic alternatives, including refinancing their securities or effecting a sale of our Company or its assets. We cannot assure you that the rights associated with the Series C Preferred Stock or our other series of preferred stock will not adversely affect the holders of our common stock.\nWe Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, and You Must Rely on Increases in the Market Prices of Our Common Stock for Returns on Your Investment.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the Board deems relevant.\nOur Executive Officers and Directors Possess Controlling Voting Power With Respect to Our Common Stock, Which Will Limit Your Influence on Corporate Matters.\nOur directors and executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately 61% of our voting stock as of March 14, 2017. As a result, our insiders have the ability to effectively control our management and affairs through the election and removal of our Board and all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including any future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change-of-control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical effect of your influence over our business and affairs, through any stockholder vote or otherwise. Any of these effects could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur Executive Chairman Mr. Farkas and His Affiliates Collectively Own Approximately 57% of Our Common Stock And May Be Able To Influence The Outcome of Stockholder Votes. Mr. Farkas\u2019 Interests May Differ From Other Stockholders.\nAs of March 14, 2017, our Executive Chairman and director Mr. Farkas and his affiliates beneficially own 91,215,664 shares of our common stock representing approximately 57% of our outstanding shares of common stock on an as-converted basis. See \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management\u201d for more information on the beneficial ownership of our common stock. Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Nevada law, Mr. Farkas may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have some control over our management and policies. Mr. Farkas may have interests that are different from yours. For example, Mr. Farkas may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our Company, which in turn could reduce the price of our stock. In addition, Mr. Farkas could use his voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office, delay or prevent changes in control of our Company, or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions.\nIn addition, we have a significant amount of indebtedness in the form of various agreements in favor of an entity affiliated with Mr. Farkas, The Farkas Group, Inc., including certain convertible notes which have matured and are past due. We have not satisfied this debt and are in negotiations with Mr. Farkas to extend the maturity dates of such notes. If we are unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, Mr. Farkas could seek to enforce the notes against us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation Grants Our Board The Power to Issue Additional Shares of Common And Preferred Stock And to Designate Other Classes of Preferred Stock, All Without Stockholder Approval.\nOur authorized capital consists of 540,000,000 shares of capital stock of which 40,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock. Our Board, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares of preferred stock in such series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights, provided it is consistent with Nevada law.\nThe rights of holders of our preferred stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.\nCertain Provisions of Our Corporate Governing Documents And Nevada Law Could Discourage, Delay, or Prevent A Merger or Acquisition at a Premium Price.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and Nevada law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws permit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the shares of the series.", "PERMNO": 17313, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "BLNK"}
