RISK FACTORS\nOUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nManagement has identified certain conditions or events, which, considered in the aggregate, could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our auditors have drawn attention to this uncertainty in their report on our consolidated financial statements. Management has developed a plan to mitigate our going concern risk. If we are unable to execute our plan, it is possible that we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our shareholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding a going concern uncertainty in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended, June 30, 2019, indicating that, as discussed in Note 1 to such audited consolidated financial statements, we are experiencing difficulty in generating sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain our operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Continued operations and our ability to continue as a going concern are dependent on our ability to execute our plan described in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consideration of Going Concern,\u201d and there are no assurances that we will be able to execute such plan. Uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern may also hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to execute our plan, it is possible that we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our shareholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us. See also \u201c-Our ability to return to profitability and positive cash flow is substantially dependent on our ability to execute our strategic plan in South Africa\u201d and \u201c-Ongoing losses and cash demands may place the group under liquidity pressure, particularly if various asset realizations are not concluded.\nSASSA\u2019s migration of EPE customers to the SAPO account during the first half of fiscal 2019 resulted in the loss of a significant portion of our EPE customer base. Unless we are able to maintain our EPE customer base, our South African financial services business will likely become unsustainable and result in the closure of most or all of that business.\nDuring September and October 2018, SASSA migrated those of our EPE customers who had not submitted to SASSA a signed Annexure C form and failed to process many of the Annexure C forms submitted by our potential customers. As a result, we experienced a decline in the EPE customer base to under 1.1 million EPE accounts receiving grants during December 2018 and January 2019. These same factors have had an adverse impact on our ability to sign up new customers to the EPE product and, as a result, we have experienced very low levels of gross new EPE accounts. As described under \u201cItem 3.-Legal Proceedings-Legal proceedings against SASSA in respect of transfer of grant payments from EPE to SAPO accounts\u201d, we commenced legal proceedings against SASSA challenging its actions but, in late January 2019, the High Court ruled that SASSA may pay grants into SAPO accounts unless the grant recipient has delivered a signed Annexure C form to SASSA.\nWhile our EPE customer base has been relatively stable since November 2018, any decision by SASSA to migrate more of our EPE customers to SAPO accounts would threaten our entire South African financial services business and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEven if we are able to maintain a sufficient EPE customer base, we may still face challenges in transforming our South African operations to a business-to-consumer model through our EPE bank account and ATM infrastructure.\nFollowing the conclusion of the SASSA contract on September 30, 2018, we refocused our resources and technology on the provision of financial inclusion services to our target market. In particular we enabled our mobile ATM payment infrastructure to become part of the South African National Payment System and concentrated on taking our ATMs to the rural populations of South Africa so that they have the same access to financial inclusion as they had during the tenure of our contract, without the many inconveniences and inefficiencies of SASSA\u2019s new payment model.\nWhile we believe that our financial services offerings are convenient and cost-effective, the success of our strategy will depend on the extent to which South African customers continue to use our financial products and services on a widespread basis.\nAs discussed in the risk factor immediately above, SASSA\u2019s unilateral decision to move EPE customers to the SASSA account and the subsequent judgment that has limited our ability to oppose SASSA\u2019s actions, will likely make it more difficult for us to attract and retain as many EPE customers as we had previously planned.\nEven if we continue to maintain our current EPE customer base, to the extent where such business remains viable, other factors may prevent us from successfully operating and growing our South African financial services business include, but are not limited to:\nreduced adoption and utilization of our EPE accounts and related products and services;\ninsufficient utilization of our ATM infrastructure, especially our mobile ATM infrastructure;\ninability to access sufficient funding for our ATM infrastructure;\ncompetition in the marketplace;\nrestrictions imposed by SASSA or government on the manner in which recipients may transact;\nadditional and/ or protracted legal proceedings with SASSA or other parties;\npolitical interference;\nchanges in the regulatory environment;\ndependence on existing suppliers to provide the hardware (such as ATMs, cards and POS devices) we require to execute our rollout as anticipated;\nlogistical and communications challenges; and\nloss of key technical and operations staff.\nOur ability to return to profitability and positive cash flow is substantially dependent on our ability to execute our strategic plan in South Africa.\nNo assurance can be provided that, if we fail to effectively execute our strategic plan in South Africa, we will be able to return to profitability and, even if we do return to profitability, extended periods of profitability and net income do not assure positive cash flows. Future periods of net losses from operations could result in negative cash flow and may hamper ongoing operations and prevent us from sustaining or expanding our business. We cannot assure you that we will achieve, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If we do not achieve, sustain or increase profitability, our business will be materially and adversely affected and our share price may decline.\nOngoing losses and cash demands may place the group under liquidity pressure, particularly if various asset realizations are not concluded.\nDuring the last twelve months, we have seen a significant decline in our cash balances due to significant operating losses, which were attributed primarily to the significant losses we incurred during the six-month extension of the SASSA contract and the exceptional bad debt write-offs caused by the migration of EPE customers to SAPO accounts by SASSA. While we have taken significant actions in the last six months to reduce the debt on our balance sheet, should our operating performance not improve, or if various adverse events occur, then our liquidity may come under significant pressure. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to operate effectively and efficiently in South Africa in the future will be adversely impacted if we are unable to communicate persuasively that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the customers who purchase our financial services products.\nThe South African public, media, non-governmental organizations and political parties have utilized a number of platforms, including social media, to criticize SASSA over its failure to implement the orders of the Constitutional Court over the last two years and express their dissatisfaction with the state of affairs. Among the criticisms, we have been accused of being responsible for SASSA\u2019s inability to bring the payment service in-house. In addition, we were publicly accused of illegally providing our services and defrauding social welfare grant recipients. We have publicly denied these accusations and believe they have no merit.\nOur reputation in South Africa has been tarnished as a result of these accusations. We have attempted to refute the allegations made against us and have appointed a public relations firm to assist us in communicating effectively to the public and our stakeholders that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the social welfare grant recipients who purchase the financial services products that we offer. It is difficult to quantify to what extent we have been successful in effectively repudiating these unsubstantiated allegations against us. If we are unable to communicate persuasively that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the customers who purchase our financial services products, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently in South Africa in the future will be adversely impacted, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nWe have been ordered by the Supreme Court to repay to SASSA certain reimbursed implementation costs. We are analyzing the ruling in order to determine our next course of action, but if we are ultimately required to repay substantial monies to SASSA, such repayment would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn March 2015, Corruption Watch, a South African non-profit civil society organization, commenced a legal proceeding in the High Court seeking an order by the Court to review and set aside the decision of SASSA\u2019s Chief Executive Officer to approve a payment to us of ZAR 317.0 million (approximately ZAR 277 million, excluding VAT) and directed us to repay the aforesaid amount, plus interest. Corruption Watch claimed that there was no lawful basis to make the payment to us, and that the decision was unreasonable and irrational and did not comply with South African legislation. We were named as a respondent in this legal proceeding.\nOn February 22, 2018, the matter was heard by the Gauteng Division, Pretoria of the High Court of South Africa. On March 23, 2018, the High Court ordered that the June 15, 2012 variation agreement between SASSA and CPS be reviewed and set aside. CPS was ordered to refund ZAR 317.0 million to SASSA, plus interest from June 2014 to date of payment. On April 4, 2018, we filed an application seeking leave to appeal the whole order and judgment of the High Court because we believed that the High Court erred in its application of the law and/or in fact in its findings. On April 25, 2018, the High Court rejected the application seeking leave to appeal. CPS filed an application seeking leave to appeal the whole order and judgment of the High Court with the Supreme Court of Appeal. In September 2018, CPS received notification from the Supreme Court that its petition seeking leave to appeal had been granted. The matter was heard on September 10, 2019.\nOn September 30, 2019 the Supreme Court dismissed our appeal and ordered us to pay Corruption Watch\u2019s costs. We are analyzing the ruling in order to determine our next course of action. We have recorded a liability of $34.0 million (ZAR 479.4 million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2019, comprising the refund of ZAR 317.0 million, accrued interest of ZAR 161.0 million and estimated costs of ZAR 1.4 million) in our audited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 in the caption other payables.\nIn addition, in an April 2014 ruling, the Constitutional Court ordered SASSA to re-run the tender process and required us to file with the Court, after completion of our SASSA contract in March 2017, an audited statement of our expenses, income and net profit under the contract. The March 2018 Constitutional Court order contains a similar requirement that we file an audited statement of our expenses, income and net profit within 30 days of the completion of the contract. We have filed the required independently audited information with the Constitutional Court as ordered and the auditors expressed an unqualified opinion with an emphasis of matter regarding the basis of preparation and restriction as to use. The Constitutional Court also ordered SASSA to audit the audited information filed with the Constitutional Court and SASSA appointed an independent firm to audit our submission. The independent audit is currently underway and we understand that the independent firm is due to file its report by October 31, 2019. Parties to the March 2018 court proceedings also requested the Constitutional Court to consider further orders, including the repayment of any profits derived by CPS under its SASSA contract. The Constitutional Court did not provide for this in its March 2018 order; however, one or more third parties may in the future institute litigation challenging our right to retain a portion of the amounts we will have received from SASSA under our contract. We cannot predict whether any such litigation will be instituted, or if it is, whether it would be successful.\nAny successful challenge to our right to receive and retain payments from SASSA that requires substantial repayments would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe pricing recommended by National Treasury to the Constitutional Court for our services provided at pay points for the period from April 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018, has not yet been paid and we have commenced legal action for payment against SASSA. If we are not paid, or if the amount ultimately paid to us is not commercially reasonable, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nUnder the Constitutional Court order of March 23, 2018, related to the extension of the SASSA contract to September 30, 2018 in respect of the recipients paid at cash pay points, we were granted permission to approach National Treasury to request revised pricing of the contract. National Treasury provided a recommendation to the Constitutional Court in compliance with their order at a price per recipient of R51.00 (VAT inclusive) per month. Although we offered to accept this amount in respect of the three months ended June 30, 2018 when the number of recipients paid approximated two million per month, we asked the Constitutional Court to reconsider the last three months of the contract. In line with SASSA\u2019s public statements, there was a material reduction in the number of recipients paid at the pay points during July, August and September 2018.\nIn December 2018, we received correspondence from the Constitutional Court informing the parties that it believes that \u201cnothing prevents the parties from coming to an agreement on increased payments without court sanction, and if they do not, normal legal processes in other courts must be filed to determine the effects.\u201d We engaged SASSA directly in order to resolve this matter however we were not able to reach an amicable agreement and have commenced legal action as described under \u201cItem 3.-Legal Proceedings-Dispute with SASSA regarding payment of fees for the last six months of the contract\u201d. If we do not receive payment from SASSA, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or make strategic investments that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments are an integral part of our long-term growth strategy as we seek to grow our business internationally and to deploy our technologies in new markets both inside and outside South Africa. However, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition or investment candidates at prices that we consider appropriate. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition or investment candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of the transaction, finance it or, if the transaction occurs, integrate the new business into our existing business. These transactions may require debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. For instance, in July 2017, we invested in Cell C Proprietary Limited, or Cell C, utilizing a combination of existing cash reserves and external debt from South African banks.\nAcquisitions of businesses or other material operations and the integration of these acquisitions or their businesses will require significant attention from our senior management which may divert their attention from our day to day business. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. We also may not be able to retain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates.\nIn addition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. For instance, in December 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $7.0 million related to goodwill identified in the T24 acquisition and in March 2019, we recorded an impairment loss of $5.3 million related to the certain intangible assets identified in the DNI acquisition.\nIn March 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $19.9 million related to the goodwill identified in the Masterpayment and Masterpayment Financial Services acquisitions. Finally, acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition.\nWe have not achieved the expected benefits from our Cell C and DNI investments and may incur further losses related to these investments.\nWe invested more than $240 million, in aggregate, to acquire a 15% interest in Cell C and a 55% controlling interest in DNI. At the time of each investment, we believed that there were potential synergies that we could derive from each of these transactions, including the integration of certain of our service offerings with those of Cell C and DNI. However, we have not yet realized some of the synergies that we had anticipated to achieve by now, and it is possible that we may not realize such synergies at all.\nAttempting to integrate these service offerings may be disruptive to us, and we may not be able to integrate these offerings successfully. Even if we are able to achieve this integration, our customers may not use these services to the extent that we expect they will. Any such failure could adversely impact our business or the businesses of Cell C and DNI, which could, in turn, reduce the value of our investments in them. Additionally, attempting to integrate Cell C\u2019s and DNI\u2019s offerings with our own may adversely impact our other business and operational relationships. Our inability to achieve the expected synergies from the Cell C and DNI transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, Cell C and DNI may not be able to successfully execute their respective business plans, which may adversely affect, or impair, the carrying value of our investments in them. As an example, during the year ended June 30, 2019, we recorded a loss related to the change in fair value for Cell C of $167.5 million which adversely impacted our results of operations and financial position. Our investments in Cell C and Cedar Cellular Investment 1 (RF) (Pty) Ltd, or Cedar Cellular, 8.625% notes were carried at $0 as of June 30, 2019, refer to Notes 7 and 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments. We also incurred a loss of $5.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019, related to the reduction in our investment in DNI from 55% to 30%.\nWe have granted a call option to DNI to acquire our remaining 30% interest in DNI in order to improve our liquidity. If we are unable to dispose of our entire, or a partial interest in DNI, in the short-term our financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe have determined to sell all or a portion of our remaining investment in DNI in order to generate additional liquidity to fund certain of our other businesses. On May 3, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Net1 Applied Technologies South Africa Proprietary Limited, or Net1 SA, entered into an agreement pursuant to which it granted a call option to DNI to acquire Net1 SA\u2019s remaining 30% interest in DNI. The option expires on December 31, 2019, but may be exercised at any time prior to expiration. The option strike price is calculated as ZAR 2.827 billion ($200.8 million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2019) less any special distribution made by DNI multiplied by Net1 SA\u2019s retained interest (i.e. assuming no special distribution, the strike price for the 30% retained interest is ZAR 859.3 million, or $61.0 million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2019). The call option may be split into smaller denominations, but Net1 SA cannot be left with less than 20% unless the whole remaining interest is disposed of. DNI may nominate another party to exercise the call option in the place of DNI, provided that the nominated party acquires call options representing at least 1.0% of DNI\u2019s voting and participation interests.\nIf we are unable to dispose of our entire, or a partial interest in DNI, in the short-term our financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nDNI generates most of its revenue by providing services to or on behalf of Cell C, principally through the sale of mobile phone starter packs. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would suffer materially if DNI were to lose its contractual relationships with Cell C.\nDNI\u2019s business comprises of a number of separate entities that are primarily involved in the distribution of mobile phone starter packs, mainly on behalf of Cell C. DNI also provides funding for the expansion of Cell C\u2019s mobile telecommunications infrastructure.\nIf Cell C were to terminate any of these contractual relationships that have multi-year notice periods, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow as a consequence of the impact on DNI. In particular our remaining 30% interest in DNI is likely to be worth less in the event that these contractual relationships are terminated.\nWe have indebtedness that requires us to comply with restrictive and financial covenants. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, we could default on this debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have credit facilities from Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, or RMB, and Nedbank Limited, South African banks. The facilities are secured by intercompany cross-guarantees, a guarantee from Net1 and a pledge by Net1 SA of its entire equity interests in Cell C, DNI and FIHRST. The terms of the lending arrangement contain covenants that require Net1 SA to maintain certain asset cover ratios and restrict the ability of Net1 SA, and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, prepay other debt, encumber their assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investment above specified levels, engage in certain business combinations and engage in other corporate activities without the approval of the lenders.\nIn addition, DNI has a three year revolving credit facility of ZAR 200 million ($14.2 million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2019) from RMB to expand its operations. We are a reversionary guarantor of this credit facility as a result of our shareholding in DNI. The revolving credit facility is secured by intercompany cross-guarantees within the DNI group and a pledge by DNI of its entire equity interests in its subsidiaries. The terms of the lending arrangement contain customary covenants that require DNI to remain in accordance with specified net senior debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to net senior interest ratios and restrict the ability of DNI, and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, prepay other debt, encumber their assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investment above specified levels, engage in certain business combinations and engage in other corporate activities without the approval of the lenders.\nThese security arrangements and covenants may reduce our operating flexibility or our ability to engage in other transactions that may be beneficial to us. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in South Africa, we could be in default and the indebtedness could be accelerated. If this were to occur, we might not be able to obtain waivers of default or to refinance the debt with another lender and as a result, our business and financial condition would suffer.\nWe may be unable to secure the necessary facilities that will enable us to maintain the cash requirements for our ATM network\nThe expansion of our fixed and mobile ATM network, along with an increase in our consumer banking client base, necessitates access to large amounts of cash to stock the ATMs and maintain uninterrupted service levels. We currently utilize debt facilities that expire in September 2020 to fund these ATMs. Any adverse change to the terms of these credit facilities, a significant reduction in the amounts available under these credit facilities, or our failure to increase our facilities if required, will have an adverse impact on our ability to continue uninterrupted operation of our ATM network and our revenues from this business. We will also suffer reputational damage if our service levels are negatively impacted due to the unavailability of cash.\nWe face competition from the incumbent retail banks in South Africa and SAPO in the unbanked market segment, which could limit our growth.\nCertain South African banks have also developed their own low-cost banking products targeted at the unbanked and under-banked market segment. According to the 2018 FinScope SA 2018 Fact Sheet, a survey conducted by the FinMark Trust, a nonprofit independent trust, 80% of South Africans are banked. As the competition to bank the unbanked in South Africa intensifies, we may not be successful in marketing our low-cost products to our target population. Moreover, as our product offerings increase, gain market acceptance and pose a competitive threat in South Africa, especially our UEPS/EMV product with biometric verification and our financial services offerings, the banks and SAPO may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as disrupting their transactional or other businesses.\nOur microlending loan book exposes us to credit risk and our allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs.\nAll of these microfinance loans made are for a period of six months or less. We have created an allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable related to this book. Management has considered factors including the period of the finance loan outstanding, creditworthiness of the customers and the past payment history of the borrower when creating the allowance. We consider this policy to be appropriate taking into account factors such as historical bad debts, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns.\nHowever, additional allowances may be required should the ability of our customers to make payments when due deteriorate in the future. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these finance loan receivables, including on-going evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer.\nFurthermore, as a result of SASSA\u2019s migration of customers to SAPO during the first half of fiscal 2019, we saw a significant increase in the number of our customers no longer receiving their grant income into their EPE bank account. This resulted in a very significant increase in unrecoverable amounts and a significant bad debt expense.\nAs EPE accounts have remained largely stable since November 2018, we have seen our recoverability risk return to levels consistent with our previous experience. Nevertheless, these events have increased our recoverability risk and the risk that our allowance is insufficient.\nOur working capital financing and supply chain solutions receivables expose us to credit risk and our allowance for doubtful working capital finance loans receivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs.\nWe have created an allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables related to our Korean lending activities and previously to our Mastertrading business. We have considered factors including the period of the working capital receivable outstanding, creditworthiness of the customers and the past payment history of the borrower when creating the allowance. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these and other working capital finance receivables because these are new offerings and we continue to refine and improve our processes, including the maximum amount of exposure per customer that we are willing to accept and the on-going evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer.\nA determination that requires a change in our allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables, or a failure by one or more of our customers to pay a significant portion of outstanding working capital finance receivables, could have a negative impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may face competition from other companies that offer innovative payment technologies and payment processing, which could result in the loss of our existing business and adversely impact our ability to successfully market additional products and services.\nOur primary competitors in the payment processing market include other independent processors, as well as financial institutions, independent sales organizations, new digital and fintech entrants and, potentially card networks. Many of our competitors are companies who are larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources than we have. These factors may allow them to offer better pricing terms or incentives to customers, which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well. Either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings.\nIn addition to competition that our UEPS system faces from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services and low cost bank accounts, there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system. During the past several years, smart card technology has become increasingly prevalent. We believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is EMV, a system that is promoted by most of the major card companies such as Visa, MasterCard, JCB and American Express. Also, governments and financial institutions are, to an increasing extent, implementing general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards as a low-cost alternative to provide financial services to the unbanked population. Moreover, as the acceptance of using a mobile phone to facilitate financial services has increased exponentially, other companies have introduced such services to the marketplace successfully and customers may prefer those services to ours, based on technology, price or other factors.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession in South Africa or elsewhere could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic downturn or recession could materially impact our results from operations. Also, economic confidence in South Africa, our main operating environment, is currently low and as a result the risk of an economic downturn is inflated. A recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators, our cardholders and retailers and could reduce the level of transactions we process, the sales of mobile phone starter packs, the take-up of the financial services we offer and the ability of our customers to repay our microloans or to pay their insurance premiums, which would, in turn, negatively impact our financial results. If financial institutions and retailers experience decreased demand for their products and services our hardware, software and related technology sales will reduce, resulting in lower revenue.\nThe loss of the services of certain of our executive officers would adversely affect our business.\nOur future financial and operational performance depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management, in particular, Mr. Herman Kotz\u00e9, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Alex Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. Many of our key responsibilities in South Africa are currently performed by Messrs. Kotz\u00e9 and Smith, as well as by Mr. Nanda Pillay, our Managing Director: Southern Africa. The loss of the services of any of these executives would disrupt our development efforts or business relationships and our ability to continue to innovate and to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nThe success of our KSNET business depends heavily on the continued services of its president, Phil-Hyun Oh and the other senior members of the KSNET management team. In addition, the growth and future profitability of IPG is reliant on Mr. Philip Meyer\u2019s leadership, industry knowledge and contacts. We do not maintain any \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies.\nWe face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees, particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products and to market these products to our targeted users. In order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts, we need to identify, attract, motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel. An inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property, to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology. Demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees. The risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition. Furthermore, social and economic factors in South Africa have led, and continue to lead, to numerous qualified individuals leaving the country, thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in South Africa. In addition, our multi-country strategy will also require us to hire and retain highly qualified managerial personnel in each of these markets. If we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business, it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities.\nSystem failures, including breaches in the security of our system, could harm our business.\nWe may experience system failures from time to time, and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back-end system computer could harm our revenues and profits, and could subject us to the scrutiny of our customers. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to avoid our technology altogether, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. These interruptions would increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new applications and services. Finally, because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any system failures could result in damage to our customers\u2019 businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address.\nAlthough our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.\nProtection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions. We incorporate security features, including encryption software, biometric identification and secure hardware, into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data. Our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms, the operating system and applications or the hardware platform. Security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions. If the security of our solutions is compromised, our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected, which would cause our business to suffer, and we may become subject to damage claims. We have not yet experienced any significant security breaches affecting our business.\nDespite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies.\nOur success depends in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark protection of our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as successfully enforcing this intellectual property and defending this intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protections, such as patents or trade secrets, cover them. In particular, we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.\nWe cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. For example, we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and patent applications or to file patent applications and it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. It is possible that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies. Also, our issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have confidentiality agreements with employees, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. These agreements may be breached and or may not have adequate remedies for such breach. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants or others may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, our enforcement efforts would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be more difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed. If we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our technologies, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing technologies.\nWe also rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for some of our products. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. Also, we might not obtain registrations for our pending trademark applications, and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending trademark applications from challenge by third parties.\nDefending our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves in infringement suits that may be brought against us is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful.\nLitigation to enforce our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful. Any loss of, or inability to protect, intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in countries where we currently have patent protection. Our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in countries where we currently have patent or trademark protection, or any other country in which we operate, may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims. We may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources to develop non-infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third-party claims, we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur strategy of partnering with companies outside South Africa may not be successful.\nIn order for us to expand our operations into foreign markets, it may be necessary for us to establish partnering arrangements with companies outside South Africa, such as the one we have co-established in Namibia and Mauritius (in V2 Limited) and our non-controlling investments in Nigeria, Liechtenstein and India. The success of these endeavors is, however, subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control, such as finding suitable partners with the appropriate financial, business and technical backing and continued governmental support for planned implementations. In some countries, finding suitable partners and obtaining the appropriate support from the government involved may take a number of years before we can commence implementation. Some of these partnering arrangements may take the form of joint ventures in which we receive a non-controlling interest. Non-controlling ownership carries with it numerous risks, including dependence on partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits, as well as the inability to control the joint venture vehicle and to direct its policies and strategies.\nSuch a lack of control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities. In addition, our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree. Our joint venture partners may not be able to implement our business model in new areas as efficiently and quickly as we have been able to do in South Africa. Furthermore, limitations imposed on our South African subsidiaries by South African exchange control regulations, as well as limitations imposed on us by the Investment Company Act of 1940, may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities in which we do not obtain a controlling interest.\nWe pre-fund certain merchant and customer payments in South Africa and South Korea and a significant level of payment defaults by these merchants or customers would adversely affect us.\nWe pre-fund the settlement of funds to certain merchants and customers in South African and South Korea. These pre-funding obligations expose us to the risk of default by these merchants and customers. Although we have not experienced any material defaults by merchants or customers in the return of pre-funded amounts to us, we cannot guarantee that material defaults will not occur in the future. A material level of merchant or customer defaults could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash through our payment infrastructure in South Africa.\nMany cardholders use our services to access cash using their debit cards. We use armored vehicles and our own fixed ATM infrastructure to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across South Africa to enable these cardholders to receive this cash. In some cases, we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas. We cannot insure against certain risks of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles, ATMs or depots and we will therefore bear the full cost of certain uninsured losses or theft in connection with the cash handling process, and such losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We have not incurred any material losses resulting from cash distribution in recent years, but there is no assurance that we will not incur material losses in the future.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\nWe obtain our smart cards, ATMs, POS devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers, and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers. If our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them, or if they increase their prices, we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage. This could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline. Even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner, our costs could increase. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers\u2019 capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus, to acquire a new source of customers who use our UEPS technology. Any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur Smart Life business exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies.\nSmart Life is a life insurance company and exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies. Some of these risks include the extent to which we are able to continue to reinsure our risks at acceptable costs, reinsurer counterparty risk, maintaining regulatory capital adequacy, solvency and liquidity requirements, our ability to price our insurance products appropriately, the risk that actual claims experience may exceed our estimates, the ability to recover policy premiums from our customers and the competitiveness of the South African insurance market. If we are unable to maintain our desired level of reinsurance at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk or reduce our insurance writings. If our reinsurers are unable to meet their commitments to us in a timely manner, or at all, we may be unable to discharge our obligations under our insurance contracts. As such, we are exposed to counterparty, including credit, risk of these reinsurers. Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Using the wrong assumptions to price our insurance products could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our actual claims experience is higher than our estimates, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Finally, the South African insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are well-established, represented nationally and market similar products and we may not be able to effectively penetrate the South African insurance market.\nRisks Relating to Operating in South Africa and Other Foreign Markets\nIf we do not achieve applicable broad-based black economic empowerment objectives in our South African businesses, we risk losing our government and/or private contracts and/or risk not being in compliance with any government and/or private contracts which we have already entered into. In addition, it is possible that we may be required to increase the black shareholding of our company in a manner that could dilute your ownership and/or change the companies from which we purchase goods or procure services (to companies with a better BEE Contributor Status Level).\nThe legislative framework for the promotion of broad-based black economic empowerment, or BEE, in South Africa has been established through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, No. 53 of 2003, as amended from time to time, and the Amended BEE Codes of Good Practice, 2013, or BEE Codes, and any sector-specific codes of good practice, or Sector Codes, published pursuant thereto. Sector Codes are fully binding between and among businesses operating in a sector for which a Sector Code has been published. Achievement of BEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various elements. Save for certain instances where entities are only required to obtain an affidavit (for example, exempted micro enterprises and a qualifying small enterprise that is 51% Black Owned or 100% Black Owned (as defined in the BEE Codes and/or Sector Codes)), scorecards are independently reviewed by accredited BEE verification agencies which issue a certificate that presents an entity\u2019s BEE Contributor Status Level.\nCertain of our South African businesses are subject to either the Information, Communications and Technology Sector Code, or ICT Sector Code, or the Financial Services Sector Code. The ICT Sector Code has been amended and aligned with the new BEE Codes, and was promulgated on November 7, 2016. Likewise, the Financial Services Sector Code has been amended and aligned with the new BEE Codes, and was promulgated on December 1, 2017.\nWe have taken a number of actions as a company to increase empowerment of black (as defined under applicable regulations) South Africans. However, it is possible that these actions may not be sufficient to enable us to achieve applicable BEE objectives. In that event, in order to avoid risking the loss of our government and private contracts, we may have to seek to comply through other means, including by selling or placing additional shares of Net1 or of our South African subsidiaries to black South Africans (either directly or indirectly). Such sales or placements of shares could have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nWe expect that our BEE Contributor Status Level will be important for us in order to remain competitive in the South African marketplace and we continually seek ways to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level, especially the ownership (so-called \u201cequity element\u201d) element thereof. We have entered into various BEE transactions in the past in an effort to improve our score, including transactions in which we issued equity to BEE partners.\nIt is possible that we may find it necessary to issue additional shares to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level. If we enter into further BEE transactions that involve the issuance of equity, we cannot predict what the dilutive effect of such a transaction would be on your ownership or how it would affect the market price of our stock.\nFluctuations in the value of the South African rand have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our reported results of operations, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect our stock price.\nThe South African rand, or ZAR, is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. This means that as long as the ZAR remains our primary operating currency, depreciation in the ZAR against the U.S. dollar, and to a lesser extent, the South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, would negatively impact our reported revenue and net income, while a strengthening of the ZAR and the South Korean won would have the opposite effect. Depreciation in the ZAR may negatively impact the prices at which our stock trades. The U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate has historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue. We provide detailed information about historical exchange rates in Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Currency Exchange Rate Information.\u201d\nDue to the significant fluctuation in the value of the ZAR and its impact on our reported results, you may find it difficult to compare our results of operations between financial reporting periods even though we provide supplemental information about our results of operations determined on a ZAR basis. This difficulty may increase as we expand our business internationally and record additional revenue and expenses in the euro and other currencies. It may also have a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe generally do not engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in U.S. dollars or euros.\nWe have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the ZAR/U.S. dollar and ZAR/euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions. We cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or, if we do, that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations.\nSouth Africa\u2019s high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime may increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain a qualified workforce\nWhile South Africa has a highly developed financial and legal infrastructure, it also has high levels of crime and unemployment, relative to peer countries in Africa and other emerging economies, and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people, with large parts of the population, particularly in the rural areas, having limited access to adequate education, healthcare, housing and other basic services, including water and electricity. In addition, South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of citizens under previous governments may increase our costs and reduce our profitability, all of which could negatively affect our business. These problems may prompt emigration of skilled workers, hinder investment into South Africa and impede economic growth. As a result, we may have difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees.\nWe may not be able to effectively and efficiently manage the electricity supply disruptions in South Africa, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth.\nOur businesses in South Africa are dependent on electricity generated and supplied by the state-owned utility, Eskom, in order to operate. In recent years, Eskom has been unable to generate and supply the amount of electricity required by South Africans, and the entire country experienced significant and often unpredictable electricity supply disruptions. Eskom has implemented a number of short- and long-term mitigation plans to correct these issues and the number of supply disruptions has decreased since calendar 2016, but there was a brief reoccurrence in early calendar 2019. Eskom requires significant funding from the South African government in order to continue to operate.\nAs part of our business continuity programs, we have installed back-up diesel generators in order for us to continue to operate our core data processing facilities in Cape Town and Johannesburg in the event of intermittent disruptions to our electricity supply. We have to perform regular monitoring and maintenance of these generators as well as sourcing and managing diesel fuel levels. We may also be required to replace these generators on a more frequent basis due to the additional burden placed on them.\nOur results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth could be adversely affected if Eskom is unable raise sufficient funding to operate and/ or to commission new electricity-generating power stations in accordance with its plans, or at all, or if we are unable to effectively and efficiently test, maintain, source fuel for and replace our generators.\nThe economy of South Africa is exposed to high inflation, interest rates and rates of corporate tax, which could increase our operating costs and thereby reduce our profitability. Furthermore, the South African government requires additional income to fund future government expenditures and may be required, among other things, to increase existing income taxes rates, including the corporate income tax rate, amend existing tax legislation or introduce additional taxes.\nThe economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may continue to be, characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States and other highly developed economies. High rates of inflation could increase our South African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. Higher interest rates increase the cost of our debt financing, though conversely they also increase the amount of income we earn on any cash balances. The South corporate income tax rate, of 28%, is higher than the Federal income tax rate, of 21%, as a result of changes to U.S. tax legislation following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.\nThe South African government has announced a number of new programs and initiatives that may require funding from a variety of sources, including from an increase existing income taxes rates, including the corporate income tax rate; amendments to existing South African tax legislation; or through the introduction of additional taxes. An increase in the effective South African corporate income tax rate will adversely impact our profitability and cash flow generation.\nSouth African exchange control regulations could hinder our ability to make foreign investments and obtain foreign-denominated financing.\nSouth Africa\u2019s exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from South Africa, the Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Swaziland, known collectively as the Common Monetary Area, without the prior approval of SARB. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further relax or abolish exchange control measures in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough Net1 is a U.S. corporation and is not itself subject to South African exchange control regulations, these regulations do restrict the ability of our South African subsidiaries to raise and deploy capital outside the Common Monetary Area, to borrow money in currencies other than the South African rand and to hold foreign currency. Exchange control restrictions may also affect the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Net1 unless the affected subsidiary can show that any payment of such dividend will not place it in an over-borrowed position. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 29% of our cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) were held by our South African subsidiaries. Exchange control regulations could make it difficult for our South African subsidiaries to: (i) export capital from South Africa; (ii) hold foreign currency or incur indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies without the approval of SARB; (iii) acquire an interest in a foreign venture without the approval of SARB and first having complied with the investment criteria of SARB; or (iv) repatriate to South Africa profits of foreign operations. These regulations could also limit our ability to utilize profits of one foreign business to finance operations of a different foreign business.\nUnder current exchange control regulations, SARB approval would be required for any acquisition of our company which would involve payment to our South African shareholders of any consideration other than South African rand. This restriction could limit our management in its ability to consider strategic options and thus, our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares.\nOperating in South Africa and other emerging markets subjects us to greater risks than those we would face if we operated in more developed markets.\nEmerging markets such as South Africa, as well as some of the other markets into which we have recently begun to expand, including African countries outside South Africa, South and Southeast Asia and Central Europe, are subject to greater risks than more developed markets. While we focus our business primarily on emerging markets because that is where we perceive to be the greatest opportunities to market our products and services successfully, the political, economic and market conditions in many of these markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully.\nSome of these risks include:\n-\npolitical and economic instability, including higher rates of inflation and currency fluctuations;\n-\nhigh levels of corruption, including bribery of public officials;\n-\nloss due to civil strife, acts of war or terrorism, guerrilla activities and insurrection;\n-\na lack of well-developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights;\n-\nlogistical, utilities (including electricity and water supply) and communications challenges;\n-\npotential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including import and export license requirements and restrictions, tariffs, legal structures and tax laws;\n-\ndifficulties in staffing and managing operations and ensuring the safety of our employees;\n-\nrestrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets;\n-\ngreater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\n-\nindigenization and empowerment programs;\n-\nexposure to liability under the UK Bribery Act; and\n-\nexposure to liability under U.S. securities and foreign trade laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and regulations established by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.\nMany of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and political, legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies. However, institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world. Many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and, as a result, are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions. Moreover, the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and, therefore, existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. In some circumstances, it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner.\nAs the political, economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development, investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments. Any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur KSNET operations may be adversely affected by tension in the Korean peninsula.\nOur KSNET operations contributed $138.4 million and $9.7 million of our revenue and operating income, respectively, for our 2019 fiscal year. In the last few years, tension in the Korean peninsula has increased because of concern about potential acts of military aggression or cyber-attacks. KSNET is a transaction processor and its operations are dependent on continuing high levels of consumer activity and the availability of data communication infrastructure. Acts of military aggression in the Korean peninsula, other hostile acts or economic weakness that reduces spending by South Korean consumers is likely to materially and adversely impact our KSNET operations as well as our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nThe South African National Credit Regulator has applied to cancel the registration of our subsidiary, Moneyline Financial Services (Pty) Ltd, as a credit provider. If the registration is cancelled, we will not be able to provide loans to our customers, which would harm our business.\nMoneyline provides microloans to our EPE cardholders. Moneyline is a registered credit provider under the South African National Credit Act, or NCA, and is required to comply with the NCA in the operation of its lending business. In September 2014, the South African National Credit Regulator, or NCR, applied to the National Consumer Tribunal to cancel Moneyline\u2019s registration, based on an investigation concluded by the NCR.\nThe NCR has alleged, among other things, that Moneyline contravened the NCA by including child support grants and foster child grants in the affordability assessments performed by Moneyline prior to granting credit to these borrowers, and that the procedures followed and documentation maintained by Moneyline are not in accordance with the NCA. We believe that Moneyline has conducted its business in compliance with NCA and we are opposing the NCR\u2019s application. However, if the NCR\u2019s application is successful, Moneyline would be prohibited from operating its microlending business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with certain U.S. laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions, which could adversely impact our future growth.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign trade control laws and regulations, including various export controls and economic sanctions programs, such as those administered by OFAC, as well as European sanctions. We monitor compliance in accordance with the 10 principles as set out in the United Nations Global Compact Principles, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations relating to corruption, and the International Labor Organization Protocol in terms of certain of the items to be monitored. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating trade control laws as well as sanctions regulations.\nEconomic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors and customers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.\nViolations of trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international trade control laws and regulations, including trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of OFAC violations in the future.\nWe are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and UK Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, which could adversely impact our future growth\nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA.\nIn addition, we have to comply with the UK Bribery Act which includes provisions that extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals not employed by a government. The provisions of the UK Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Some of the international locations in which we operate, lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption.\nAny failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees, agents and business partners comply with the FCPA could subject us to substantial penalties. In addition, the requirement that we comply with the FCPA could put us at a competitive disadvantage with companies that are not required to comply with the FCPA or could otherwise harm our business. For example, in many emerging markets, there may be significant levels of official corruption, and thus, bribery of public officials may be a commonly accepted cost of doing business. Our refusal to engage in illegal behavior, such as paying bribes, may result in us not being able to obtain business that we might otherwise have been able to secure or possibly even result in unlawful, selective or arbitrary action being taken against us by foreign officials.\nOur current and potential competitors may use U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA, to disrupt our business operations and harm our reputation in the territories in which we operate or in which we intend to expand into. For instance, as we have previously reported, in November 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice commenced an investigation into whether we violated the FCPA and other U.S. federal criminal laws by engaging in a scheme to make corrupt payments to officials of the South Africa government in connection with securing our 2012 SASSA contract and whether we violated federal securities laws in connection with statements made by us in our SEC filings regarding this contract. The investigations commenced as a result of reports made to the relevant U.S. authorities by a losing bidder to the 2012 SASSA contract. While these investigations have all been concluded with no adverse findings against us, during the course of the investigations, management\u2019s time was diverted from other matters relating to our business and we suffered harm to our business reputation. Furthermore, in fiscal 2013, the FSB suspended Smart Life\u2019s insurance license. Our management has to spend a disproportionate amount of time explaining the circumstances surrounding, and the result of the investigations, when engaging new business partners, shareholders or regulators.\nViolations of anti-corruption laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and regulations, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince less developed countries present some of the best opportunities for us to expand our business internationally, restrictions against entering into transactions with those foreign countries, as well as with certain entities and individuals in those countries, can adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe do not have a South African banking license and, therefore, we provide our EPE solution through an arrangement with a third-party bank, which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it. If this arrangement were to terminate, we would not be able to operate our EPE business without alternate means of access to a banking license.\nThe South African retail banking market is highly regulated. Under current law and regulations, our EPE business activities requires us to be registered as a bank in South Africa or to have access to an existing banking license.\nWe are not currently so registered, but we have an agreement with Grindrod Bank that enables us to implement our EPE solution in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. If the agreement were to be terminated, we would not be able to operate these services unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means. We are also dependent on Grindrod Bank to defend us against attacks from the other South African banks who may regard the rapid market acceptance of our UEPS/EMV product with biometric verification as disruptive to their funds transfer or other businesses and may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention. Furthermore, we have to comply with the strict anti-money laundering and customer identification regulations of the SARB when we open new bank accounts for our customers and when they transact. Failure to effectively implement and monitor these regulations may result in significant fines or prosecution of Grindrod Bank and ourselves.\nWe have recently commenced issuing consumer banking products through our relationship with Finbond, in the form of our Kanako and Infinity products, with Finbond taking the place of Grindrod in respect of these products. However, it would not be readily achievable to transfer our EPE solution from Grindrod to Finbond.\nIn addition, the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002, requires persons who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in South Africa to register as financial service providers. Smart Life was granted an Authorized Financial Service Provider, or FSP, license on June 9, 2015, and Moneyline Financial Services (Pty) Ltd and Net1 Mobile Solutions (Pty) Ltd were each granted FSP licenses on July 11, 2017. If our FSP licenses are cancelled, we may be stopped from continuing our financial services businesses in South Africa.\nOur payment processing businesses are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.\nOur payment processing activities are subject to extensive regulation. Compliance with the requirements under the various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.\nWe may be subject to regulations regarding privacy, data use and/or security, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to regulations in a number of the countries in which we operate relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about the people who use our products and services, in particular, \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d and personal financial information. New laws in this area, such as GDPR, have been passed by several jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. The interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect on May 25, 2018, in the European Union and introduced direct compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors. National Data Protection Agencies, or NDPAs, are now able to impose fines for violations ranging from 2% to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 10 million to 20 million euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, and obtain access to premises. Businesses must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds. The GDPR adopts a risk-based approach to compliance, under which businesses bear responsibility for assessing the degree of risk that their processing activities pose to data subjects. Businesses are required to perform data protection impact assessments before any processing that uses new technology and is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects. The GDPR requires businesses to maintain records of their processing activities. Clear rules around data breach notifications and the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual have been set out by the GDPR. In addition, under the GDPR, data subjects have new rights, for example, the right to request that businesses delete their personal data (the right to be forgotten); to object to their personal data being processed; and to obtain a copy of their personal data within a set time frame.\nComplying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any regulatory requirements or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.\nAmendments to the NCA were signed into law in South Africa in August 2019. There is general consensus in the financial services community in South Africa that the debt-relief bill will restrict the ability of financial services providers to provide lending products to certain low-income earners and will increase the cost of credit to these consumers. Compliance with these amendments may adversely impact our micro-lending operations in South Africa.\nIn August 2019, the National Credit Amendment Bill, or debt-relief bill, was signed into law in South Africa. The effective date of the debt-relief bill has not yet been announced. There is general consensus in the financial services community in South Africa that the debt-relief bill will restrict the ability of financial services providers to provide lending products to certain low-income earners and will increase the cost of credit to these consumers. Compliance with the debt-relief bill may adversely impact our micro-lending operations in South Africa.\nThe debt-relief bill is a debt-relief intervention that forms part of an amendment to the NCA and is intended to assist over-indebted individuals who earn less than a prescribed monthly minimum, currently ZAR 7,500, and have unsecured debt of no more than ZAR 50,000. Individuals that have not commenced a debt counseling process, have not been sequestrated and are not subject to an administration order may seek debt relief under the debt-relief bill. Applications for debt relief are expected to be processed by the NCR and will then be submitted to the National Consumer Tribunal, or NCT.\nThe NCR will first assess whether an applicant can meet its debt obligations by paying a lower installment over an extended period of no more than five years, a so called debt re-arrangement. This process is similar to the debt counseling provisions in existing legislation, except the applicant would not pay for the debt counselor and therefore does not enjoy the services of the counselor. If the applicant has no income, the NCR will recommend that the applicant\u2019s debts be suspended for 24 months in the hopes that the applicant\u2019s circumstances improve in order to service the debt over time. During this period, interest and fees under the debt arrangement will cease and the applicant is required to attend a financial literacy program provided by the NCR. If the applicant\u2019s circumstances improve during this period, and the applicant is able to meet its debt obligations, the NCR will recommend a debt re-arrangement to the NCT. If the applicant\u2019s circumstances do not improve after 24 months, the NCR will apply to the NCT for the debt to be written off.\nA credit provider may not enforce any rights under a credit agreement if the associated debt is written off. All or part of a credit agreement will be deemed reckless under the NCA if a credit provider enters into a credit agreement (other than a consolidated loan) with an applicant while under debt relief. An applicant furnishing false information when applying for debt relief may be fined or imprisoned for not longer than two years, or both, and is permanently prohibited from applying for debt relief.\nWe expect that it will take us, and other financial services providers, some time to fully understand, interpret and implement this new legislation in our lending processes and practices. Non-compliance with the provision of this new legislation may result in financial loss and penalties, reputational loss or other administrative punishment.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has experienced recent significant volatility. During the 2019 fiscal year, our stock price ranged from a low of $2.78 to a high of $9.66. We expect that the trading price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:\nany adverse developments in litigation or regulatory actions in which we are involved;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate;\nannouncement of additional BEE transactions, especially one involving the issuance or potential issuance of equity securities or dilution or sale of our existing business in South Africa;\nquarterly variations in our operating results, especially if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\nsignificant fair value adjustments in respect of investments;\nannouncements of acquisitions, disposals or impairments of intangible assets;\nthe timing of or delays in the commencement, implementation or completion of investments or major projects;\nlarge purchases or sales of our common stock;\ngeneral conditions in the markets in which we operate; and\neconomic and financial conditions.\nThe put right we have agreed to grant to the IFC Investors on the occurrence of certain triggering events may have adverse impacts on us.\nIn May 2016, we issued an aggregate of 9,984,311 shares of our common stock to the IFC Investors. We granted the IFC Investors certain rights, including the right to require us to repurchase any shares we have sold to the IFC Investors upon the occurrence of specified triggering events, which we refer to as a \u201cput right.\u201d Events triggering the put right relate to (1) us being the subject of a governmental complaint alleging, a court judgment finding or an indictment alleging that we (a) engaged in specified corrupt, fraudulent, coercive, collusive or obstructive practices; (b) entered into transactions with targets of economic sanctions; or (c) failed to operate our business in compliance with anti-money laundering or anti-terrorism laws; or (2) we reject a bona fide offer to acquire all of our outstanding shares at a time when we have in place or implement a shareholder rights plan, or adopt a shareholder rights plan triggered by a beneficial ownership threshold of less than twenty percent. The put price per share will be the higher of the price per share paid to us by the IFC Investors and the volume-weighted average price per share prevailing for the 60 trading days preceding the triggering event, except that with respect to a put right triggered by rejection of a bona fide offer, the put price per share will be the highest price offered by the offeror. If a put triggering event occurs, it could adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, the existence of the put right could also affect whether or on what terms a third party might in the future offer to purchase our company. Our response to any such offer could also be complicated, delayed or otherwise influenced by the existence of the put right.\nApproximately 39% of our outstanding common stock is owned by three shareholders. The interests of these shareholders may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nThere is a concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock because approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock is owned by three shareholders. Based on their most recent SEC filings disclosing ownership of our shares, IFC Investors, International Value Advisers, LLC, or IVA, and Prescott Group Management, LLC, beneficially owned approximately 18%, 14% and 8% of our outstanding common stock, respectively.\nThe interests of the IFC Investors, IVA and Prescott, may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. As a result of the ownership by the IFC Investors, IVA and Prescott, they will be able, if they act together, to significantly influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, thus depriving shareholders of a premium for their shares, or facilitating a change of control that other shareholders may oppose.\nWe may seek to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock.\nWe may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, programming development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies, or to fund acquisitions. Because of the exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us.\nWe may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations or acquisitions as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock.\nIn recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies, to expand into new markets and to make acquisitions, all of which may be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means.\nIssuances of significant amounts of stock in the future could potentially dilute your equity ownership and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue shares for business purposes that may arise from time to time. For example, we could sell additional shares to raise capital to fund our operations or to acquire other businesses, issue shares in a BEE transaction, issue additional shares under our stock incentive plan or declare a stock dividend. Our board may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock without notice to, or further action by, our shareholders, unless shareholder approval is required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The issuance of additional shares could dilute the equity ownership of our current shareholders. In addition, additional shares that we issue would likely be freely tradable which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes, we are required to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d or changes in internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe requirement to evaluate and report on our internal control also applies to companies that we acquire. Some of these companies may not be required to comply with Sarbanes prior to the time we acquire them. The integration of these acquired companies into our internal control over financial reporting could require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs. If we fail to successfully integrate the operations of these acquired companies into our internal control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting where the control over the review of the accounting for non-routine complex transactions did not operate effectively. As a result, the control did not operate effectively in determining the correct classification in the statement of operations of the $34.0 million accrual for the implementation costs to be refunded to SASSA following the September 30, 2019 Supreme Court ruling. Accordingly, the material weakness remains unremediated as of June 30, 2019.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2019, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described above.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent potential future material weaknesses. While we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market's perception of our business and our stock price.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws, against us or certain of our directors and officers and experts.\nWhile Net1 is incorporated in the state of Florida, United States, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa and substantially all of the company\u2019s assets are located outside the United States. In addition, the majority of Net1\u2019s directors and all its officers reside outside of the United States and the majority of our experts, including our independent registered public accountants, are based in South Africa.\nAs a result, even though you could effect service of legal process upon Net1, as a Florida corporation, in the United States, you may not be able to collect any judgment obtained against Net1 in the United States, including any judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, because substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. Moreover, it may not be possible for you to effect service of legal process upon the majority of our directors and officers or upon our experts within the United States or elsewhere outside South Africa and any judgment obtained against any of our foreign directors, officers and experts in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by a South African court.\nSouth Africa is not a party to any treaties regarding the enforcement of foreign commercial judgments, as opposed to foreign arbitral awards. Accordingly, a foreign judgment is not directly enforceable in South Africa, but constitutes a cause of action which may be enforced by South African courts provided that:\nthe court which pronounced the judgment had international jurisdiction and competence to entertain the case according to the principles recognized by South African law with reference to the jurisdiction of foreign courts;\nthe judgment is final and conclusive (that is, it cannot be altered by the court which pronounced it);\nthe judgment has not lapsed;\nthe recognition and enforcement of the judgment by South African courts would not be contrary to public policy in South Africa, including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that no award is enforceable unless the defendant was duly served with documents initiating proceedings, that he was given a fair opportunity to be heard and that he enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal;\nthe judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent means;\nthe judgment does not involve the enforcement of a penal or foreign revenue law or any award of multiple or punitive damages; and\nthe enforcement of the judgment is not otherwise precluded by the provisions of the Protection of Business Act 99 of 1978 (as amended), of the Republic of South Africa.\nIt has been the policy of South African courts to award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the person to whom the compensation is awarded. South African courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as a result of a diminution in the value of their shares based on various actions by the corporation and its management. Although the award of punitive damages is generally unknown to the South African legal system, that does not mean that such awards are necessarily contrary to public policy.\nWhether a judgment was contrary to public policy depends on the facts of each case. Exorbitant, unconscionable, or excessive awards will generally be contrary to public policy. South African courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court. Further, if a foreign judgment is enforced by a South African court, it will be payable in South African currency. Also, under South Africa\u2019s exchange control laws, the approval of SARB is required before a defendant resident in South Africa may pay money to a non-resident plaintiff in satisfaction of a foreign judgment enforced by a court in South Africa.\nIt is doubtful whether an original action based on United States federal securities laws may be brought before South African courts. A plaintiff who is not resident in South Africa may be required to provide security for costs in the event of proceedings being initiated in South Africa. Furthermore, the Rules of the High Court of South Africa require that documents executed outside South Africa must be authenticated for the purpose of use in South African courts. In reaching the foregoing conclusions in respect of South Africa, we consulted with our South African legal counsel, Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Inc.", "PERMNO": 90875, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "UEPS"}
