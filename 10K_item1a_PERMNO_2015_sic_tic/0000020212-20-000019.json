{"cik": "20212", "company": "CHURCHILL DOWNS Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the Company\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations\nEconomic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending, including:\n\u2022Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers\u2019 disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.\n\u2022Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.\n\u2022Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets. For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.\nLower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.\nOur access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends. Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain. Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.\nWe are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and fees\nWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering and casino industries. Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions. It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customers\nHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations. To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated. A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nActs of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. Our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them. We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOther factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and\nmaterially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.\nAn inability to attract and retain key and highly-qualified and skilled personnel could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business\nWe believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly-qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization. If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted.\nCompetition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.\nCertain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impact our operations.\nOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business\nOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:\n\u2022incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022create liens on certain assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nAny failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business\nUnder our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or\n\u2022could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities. If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.\nOwnership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities\nWe own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations. All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants. Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property. Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination. Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions. We recently incurred such a penalty in connection with alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds Race Course, as further discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).\nOur operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operations\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business. A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers\u2019 information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.\nOur online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware. We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage. Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.\nOur business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches. Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers\u2019 personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our business\nWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve. Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California\u2019s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \"CCPA\"), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation. The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business\u2019s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation.\nOur systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer\u2019s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand. These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos. Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.\nThird-parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association\u2019s contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties. If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks. Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice. This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nThe extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events could adversely affect our business\nFlooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits. We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters. If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe have \"all risk\" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism). Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations.\nOur insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial. In addition, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements.\nFurthermore, portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure. Therefore, after carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.\nWe may not be able to identify and complete expansion, acquisition or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as planned\nWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.\nWe could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating such acquisition or development projects. As described in further detail below, new developments or acquisitions may not be completed or integrated successfully. The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers. Current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues. New properties or developments may not be completed or integrated successfully.\nWe may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operations\nWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future. The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns. We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all. Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources. The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results. These costs could include the following:\n\u2022restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;\n\u2022non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and\n\u2022costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.\nWe perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations. In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:\n\u2022the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;\n\u2022the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition;\n\u2022the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;\n\u2022the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers;\n\u2022costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;\n\u2022the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees or customers;\n\u2022the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.\nIf we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertainties\nWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise. Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances and other third-party agreements\nWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances with third-parties.\nOur equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives. The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project. Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance its operations. Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.\nWith any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners\u2019 economic, business or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative. We are also subject to risks relating to our co-investors\u2019 failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfaction\nOur Online Wagering and Gaming segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products. Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network. It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources. Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features. While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner. Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others\nIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties, and such other parties may allege that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.\nWe evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our own intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur results of operations may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property used in our products, including in the areas of advance deposit wagering could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nSome of our businesses are based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our businesses. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights. If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brands and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.\nCompetitors may devise new methods of competing with us which may not be covered by our patents or patent applications. Our patent applications may not be approved, the patents we have may not adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies and our patents may be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nEffective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country.\nThe laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States; therefore, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use in certain jurisdictions.\nWe have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties. These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity. To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customers\nWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (\"EFT\") and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks. Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on us\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.\nAny determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions\nFrom time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions in the ordinary course of business. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We have been subject to claims in cases concerning class action allegations. Plaintiffs in class action lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted. For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the \"Horsemen\u2019s Groups\"). These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen\u2019s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races. We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen\u2019s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis. The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen\u2019s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-parties\u2019 races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting.\nFrom time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen\u2019s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the \"FHBPA\"), which represents horsemen in Florida, and the Kentucky Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks. Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen\u2019s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe also have written agreements with certain Horsemen\u2019s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana, Florida, and Kentucky. Florida law requires Calder to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to breeders\u2019 stallion and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted by Calder before receiving a license to conduct slot machine gaming.\nWe have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks\u2019 signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks\u2019 facilities, OTBs, and ADWs. From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks\u2019 racing content for wagering at our racetracks. The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibility\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions. A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. We may experience additional union activity in the future. Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.\nRisks Related to Our Churchill Downs Segment\nOur Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships\nOur Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races. According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined on average 3% per year from 2008 to 2016 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives. From 2016 to 2019, pari-mutuel handle on horse racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 2%. If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Churchill Downs segment. If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the the Kentucky Derby. Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and complete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nHorse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigation\nPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to litigation. We carry insurance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and each of our other racetracks; however, there are certain exclusions. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Our results of operations may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as it could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nInclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racing\nWe have a limited number of live racing days at Churchill Downs Racetrack, and the number of live racing days could vary from year to year. A significant portion of our racing revenue is generated during the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week. If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs Racetrack at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nSince horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends. Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events. Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties. If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks and public health threats\nThe success of the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week is dependent upon the willingness and ability of patrons to attend events at Churchill Downs Racetrack, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance, decrease revenue, or expose us to substantial liability. Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack. A major epidemic or pandemic, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects. While we are constantly evaluating the security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities. The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at Churchill Downs Racetrack could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Churchill Downs segment operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nOur Churchill Downs segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities. To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for operation. However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses. The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operations, and could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRegulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur Churchill Downs segment faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increase\nChurchill Downs Racetrack and Derby City Gaming face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries, sports wagering, and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.\nWe also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenue for race purses and capital improvements.\nCompetition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges. Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, Churchill Downs and our other racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both continued operations and expansion. Churchill Downs Racetrack also faces significantly greater operating costs compared to costs borne by online and web-based gaming companies. Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies. These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks. Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horse races\nWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields. A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horse races. Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors, including our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and the overall horse population available for racing. Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases. If Churchill Downs Racetrack is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability. If we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.\nOur business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator services\nOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horse races. The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product. A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horse racing. A totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if wagering is unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.\nUnited Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses. Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner. Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our TwinSpires Business\nOur online horse racing wagering business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nTwinSpires accepts ADWs from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents. The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW vary from state to state. Some states have expressly authorized ADW by residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or ADW and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited residents of the state from placing wagers through ADW hubs located in different states. We believe that an online horse racing wagering business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions. However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do. In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate ADW.\nOur expansion opportunities with respect to ADW may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit ADW. Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of a Texas law prohibiting ADW. Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain. We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for ADW.\nMany states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering. Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business. The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies. Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our ADW operations.\nOur TwinSpires business may be adversely affected by the number of people wagering on live horse races\nOur TwinSpires business is dependent on wagering on live horse races at our racetracks and third-party racetracks. According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined on average 3% per year from 2008 to 2016 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives. From 2016 to 2019, pari-mutuel handle on horse racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 2%. If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Online Wagering segment. If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur TwinSpires business faces strong competition and we expect competition to increase\nOur TwinSpires business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses. Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our mobile and online wagering business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses. Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do. We may also be unable to retain our core customer base if we fail to continue to offer robust content offerings and other popular features. We anticipate increased competition in our mobile and online business from various other forms of online gaming, and our potential inability to retain customers or our failure to attract new customers could adversely affect our business.\nOur TwinSpires business is subject to a variety of laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business\nWe are subject to a variety of laws, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting. Laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these or new laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services which could harm our business. The increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Sports Betting and iGaming Business\nOur ability to predict and capitalize on the legalization of online sports betting and iGaming in the United States may impact our business, and we expect that competition will continue to grow and intensify\nA number of states have passed or are currently considering passing online sports betting and iGaming legislation. If a large number of additional states or the federal government enact online sports betting or iGaming legislation and we are unable to obtain, or are otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate online sports betting or iGaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in online sports betting and iGaming could be materially impaired.\nStates or the federal government may prevent online sports betting and iGaming or legalize online sports betting and iGaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online sports betting and iGaming subject to a brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online sports betting and iGaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms.\nWe expect that we will face increased competition for online sports betting and iGaming as the potential for legalized online sports betting and iGaming continues to grow. In the online sports betting and iGaming industry, a \"first mover\" advantage exists. Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online sports betting and iGaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so could materially impair our ability to grow in the online sports betting and iGaming space. We may fail to accurately predict when online sports betting and iGaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online sports betting and iGaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online sports betting and iGaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material impact on our business.\nWe intend to expand our sports betting operations and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, that our expansion initiatives will be successful, or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investment\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting. As a result, several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future. Our ability to be successful with our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on potential legislation in various jurisdictions that affect the sports betting industry in the United States. We continue to engage with state lawmakers in our other jurisdictions to advocate for the passage of sports betting laws with reasonable tax rates and license fees.\nOur sports betting operations will compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors. In order to compete successfully, we may need to enter into agreements with strategic partners and other third-party vendors and we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us. There can be no assurances when, or if, regulations enabling sports betting and online sportsbooks, casino gaming and poker will be adopted, or the terms of such regulations, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States, our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market, the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate, the competitive landscape, and our ability to compete with new entrants in the market, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, the performance of and licensing of third- party vendors, and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment.\nFailure to manage risks associated with sports betting may impact profitability\nSports betting operators serve as the house for wagers and must manage the risks of balancing wagers on specific events and markets unlike pari-mutuel wagering, where the operator takes a percentage of each wager. Sports wagering operators must manage risk and protect against the expertise of well-informed and sophisticated customers that may be unprofitable. We use automated risk management processes and an experienced team to manage this risk; however, our inability to manage the inherent risks associated with sports wagering could have a material adverse impact on our sports wagering business.\nFailure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon geographic location, may result in legal penalties or impairment to our ability to offer our online wagering products, in general\nIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online gaming is illegal engage our online gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, or the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. Gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal.\nRisks Related to Our Gaming Business\nOur gaming business faces significant competition from brick-and-mortar casinos and other gaming and entertainment alternatives, and we expect competition levels to increase\nOur casinos operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources. Our casino operations face competition from land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racetracks, Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries, iGaming, and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. There has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market, and legislative changes. We do not have the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors may pay lower taxes or no taxes. These factors could create challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow for our casino products that enable us to remain competitive. Legislators in Florida continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos. Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe gaming industry also faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Online and mobile interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on online and mobile activities are clarified. We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry and such increased competition may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur gaming business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business\nOur gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states in which we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals currently necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals in the future, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect or eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. Also, the gaming and other laws and regulations to which we are subject could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a \u201csporting event or contest\u201d fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (the \u201cWire Act\u201d). The DOJ\u2019s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity but a federal judge ordered in 2019 that the Wire Act applies only to wagers on a\nsporting event or contest. The DOJ is currently appealing this decision. Any such material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds, in response to which we have implemented Know Your Customer Processes. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry, and public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.\nRegulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business. The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us\nThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities, and there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry. It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests. A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the United States in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector. Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \u201cmarker,\u201d and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all U.S. states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution. However, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.", "PERMNO": 79026, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CHDN"}
