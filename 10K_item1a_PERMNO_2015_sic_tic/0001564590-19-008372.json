{"cik": "1266806", "company": "SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe statements that are not historical facts contained in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the current belief, expectations or intent of our management and are subject to and involve certain risks and uncertainties. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside of our control and are difficult for us to forecast or mitigate. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in certain of our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by us in any forward-looking statements contained herein or made elsewhere by or on behalf of us. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock or our warrants could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares or in our warrants.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Our Commercial Products\nWe depend on the success of our first commercial product, the Argus II System, which received European market clearance (CE Mark) in February 2011 and FDA approval in February 2013, in the United States for RP; and on the regulatory approval of our current product and a new device under development, the Orion visual prosthesis (a modified version of the Argus II System), to treat other causes of blindness, in the US and other countries, which may never occur.\nOur future success depends upon building a commercial operation in the US and expanding growth in Europe as well as entering additional markets to commercialize our Argus II System for RP. We believe our expanded growth will depend on the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the Orion product, which we anticipate can be used by nearly all profoundly blind individuals. If we fail to expand the use of the Argus II System in a timely manner for other forms of retinal degeneration in addition to RP, or to develop the Orion product and penetrate the available markets which those applications are intended to serve, we may not be able to expand our markets or to grow our revenue, our stock values could decline and investors may lose money.\nOur revenue from sales of Argus II System and potential future products such as Orion is dependent upon the pricing and reimbursement guidelines adopted in each country and if pricing and reimbursement levels are inadequate to achieve profitability our operations will suffer.\nOur financial success depends on our ability to price our products in a manner acceptable to government and private payers while still maintaining our profit margins. Numerous factors that may be beyond our control may ultimately impact our pricing of Argus II System and determine whether we are able to obtain reimbursement or reimbursement at adequate levels from governmental programs and private insurance. If we are unable to obtain reimbursement or our product is not adequately reimbursed, we will experience reduced sales, our revenues likely will be adversely affected, and we may not become profitable.\nObtaining reimbursement approvals is time consuming, requires substantial management attention, and is expensive. Our business will be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of the Argus II System under government programs and from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare Administrative Contractor level or by fiscal intermediaries in the US and by regional, or national funding agencies in Europe. Our business could be materially adversely affected if the Medicare program, local Medicare Administrative Contractors or fiscal intermediaries were to make such a determination and deny, restrict or limit the reimbursement of Argus II System.\nSimilarly in Europe these governmental and other agencies could deny, restrict or limit the reimbursement of Argus II System at the hospital, regional or national level. Our business also could be adversely affected if retinal specialists and the facilities within which they operate are not adequately reimbursed by Medicare and other funding agencies for the cost of the procedure in which they implant the Argus II System on a basis satisfactory to the administering retinal specialists and their facilities. If the local contractors that administer the Medicare program and other funding agencies are slow to reimburse retinal specialists or provider facilities for the Argus II System, the retinal specialists may delay their payments to us, which would adversely affect our working capital requirements. If the funding agencies delay reimbursement payments to the hospitals, any increase to their working capital requirements could reduce their willingness to treat blind patients who wish to have our devices implanted. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur commercial and financial success depends on our products being accepted in the market, and if not achieved will result in our not being able to generate revenues to support our operations.\nEven if we are able to obtain favorable reimbursement within the markets that we serve, commercial success of our products will depend, among other things, on their acceptance by retinal specialists, ophthalmologists, general practitioners, low vision therapists and mobility experts, hospital purchasing and controlling departments, patients, and other members of the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on factors that include:\n\u2022\ncost of treatment,\n\u2022\npricing and availability of future alternative products,\n\u2022\nthe extent of available third-party coverage or reimbursement,\n\u2022\nperceived efficacy of the Argus II System relative to other future products and medical solutions, and\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects associated with treatment.\nThe activities of competitive medical device companies, or others, may limit the Argus II System\u2019s revenue.\nOur commercial opportunities for the Argus II System may be reduced if our competitors develop or market products that are more effective, are better tolerated, receive better reimbursement terms, are more accepted by physicians, have better distribution channels, or are less costly.\nCurrently, to our knowledge, no other medical devices comparable to the Argus II System have been approved by regulatory agencies, in the US or Europe, to restore some functional vision in persons who have become blind due to RP. Other visual prosthesis companies such as Retina Implant AG and Pixium Vision S.A., both based in Europe, are developing retinal implant technologies to partially restore some vision in blind patients. Retina Implant has obtained a CE mark for its Alpha AMS product but has not yet sold it to our knowledge. Pixium Vision has obtained CE Mark for its IRIS II product but has withdrawn it from the market. Neither Retina Implant nor Pixium has filed for market approval with the FDA. Retina Implant has not to our knowledge obtained an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to begin the required clinical trials in the US, and Pixium Vision has not obtained an IDE for its IRIS II product to begin the required clinical trials in the US. Pixium Vision has obtained an IDE for its PRIMA product. This IDE trial is directed toward AMD, not RP. These competitive therapies if or when developed or brought to market may result in pricing and market access pressure even if Argus II System is otherwise viewed as a preferable therapy.\nMany privately and publicly funded universities and other organizations are engaged in research and development of potentially competitive products and therapies, such as stem cell and gene therapies, some of which may target RP and other indications as our product candidates. These organizations include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, hospital centers, government agencies and research organizations. Our competitors include large and small medical device and biotechnology companies that may have significant access to capital resources, competitive product pipelines, substantial research and development staffs and facilities, and substantial experience in medical device development.\nWe may face substantial competition in the future and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes which may result from others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nIn general the development and commercialization of new medical devices is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Our customers consider many factors including product reliability, clinical outcomes, product availability, inventory consignment, price, and product services provided by the manufacturer. Market share can shift as a result of technological innovation and other business factors. We believe these risk factors are partially mitigated by the Argus II System being the sole product that is currently available for commercial implantation in the US and Europe. Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of product quality in the medical device industry, and any quality problems with our processes, goods and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and would erode our competitive advantage, sales and market share. Our competitors may develop products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that we are developing and if those products gain market acceptance our revenue and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, our leadership in the markets we serve could erode, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have not been profitable to date and expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future; we may never be profitable.\nWe have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows since our inception and have financed our operations principally through equity investments and borrowings. Our ability to generate sufficient revenues to fund operations is uncertain. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we had net revenue of $6.9 million and incurred a net loss of $35.1 million. Our total accumulated deficit through December 31, 2018, was $269.5 million.\nAs a result of our limited commercial operating history, revenue is difficult to predict with certainty. Current and projected expense levels are based largely on estimates of future revenue. We expect expenses to increase in the future\nas we expand our activities in connection with the further development of Orion and complete planned enhancements of Argus II. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Accordingly, the extent of our future losses and the time required to achieve profitability, if ever, is uncertain. Failure to achieve profitability could materially and adversely affect our value and our ability to effect additional financings. The success of the business depends on our ability to increase revenues to offset expenses. If we do not achieve profitability, or otherwise fall short of projections, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming no going concern qualification by our auditors.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing, obtain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, attain favorable gross margins and ultimately, generate greater sales and create profitable operations. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion from our auditors may negatively affect the price of our common stock. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially.\nSales, or the availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for future sales, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market and the availability of shares for future sale could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. This in turn could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of our common stock and warrants or the perception that such sales could occur. We may issue and sell additional shares of our common stock in private placements or registered offerings in the future. We also may conduct additional registered rights offerings in the future pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock or other securities.\nThe warrants we issued in our recent rights offering to shareholders may create an overhang on the market and have a negative effect on the market price for our common stock.\nWe issued 13,652,341 warrants in connection with a completed rights offering in 2017 and an additional 47,812,371 warrants in connection with a completed rights offering of shares and warrants in February 2019. These warrants expire on March 14, 2024. These warrants may be used in arbitrage transactions and can cause the price of our common stock to remain below the warrant exercise price of $1.47 regardless of our performance.\nWe have identified and reported on weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in past periods and if our internal control over financial reporting were again to become ineffective, investor confidence in our Company may be adversely affected.\nIn response to identified and reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior years, we updated and improved our system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements in past years, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have remediated these reported weaknesses and have completed written documentation of our internal control policies, procedures and controls and fully completed testing of our key controls. We evaluated and tested these key controls and procedures and have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we were in the future unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls when it is required to do so by the applicable rules, we could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the regulatory authorities.\nOur remediation efforts while effective at present may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture Argus II may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products.\nWe rely on numerous suppliers to provide materials, components and services necessary to produce the Argus II System and next generation product candidates. Certain suppliers are currently sole source because of our low manufacturing volumes and our need for specialty technical or other engineering expertise. Our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to deliver these materials and services to us timely as needed or on commercially reasonable terms. Should this occur, we would seek to qualify alternative suppliers or develop in-house manufacturing capability but may be unable to do so. Substantial design or manufacturing process modifications and regulatory approval might be required to facilitate or qualify an alternate supplier. Even where we could qualify alternative suppliers the substitution of suppliers may be at a higher cost and cause time delays including delays associated with additional possible FDA review, that impede the commercial production of the Argus II System, reduce gross profit margins and impact our abilities to deliver our products as may be timely required to meet demand.\nAny failure or delay in completing clinical trials or studies for new product candidates or next generation of our products and the expense of those trials could adversely affect our business.\nPreclinical studies and clinical trials required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of incremental changes for the next generation of the Argus II System, including new externals and software enhancements and for new product candidates such as Orion are time consuming and expensive. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to any of our product candidates beyond those that we have contemplated, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other studies or if the results of these trials or studies are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for those product candidates, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval or we may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended. Our product development costs also will increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals.\nThe completion of clinical trials for our product candidates could be delayed because of our inability to manufacture or obtain from third-parties materials sufficient for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials; delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials; difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data; poor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials; unforeseen safety issues or side effects; and governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.\nIf we incur significant delays in our clinical trials, our competitors may be able to bring their products to market before we do which could result in harming our ability to commercialize our products or potential products. If we experience any of these occurrences our business will be materially harmed.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, our ability to identify, develop and commercialize new or next generation product candidates will be impaired, could result in loss of markets or market share and could make us less competitive.\nOur executives have significant medical device, regulatory, sales and marketing, operational, and/or corporate finance experience. The loss of any management executive or any other principal member of our management team could impair our ability to identify, develop and market new products or effectively deal with regulatory and reimbursement matters.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-US officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We intend to adopt policies for compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Other Legal Matters\nIf we or our licensors are unable to protect our/their intellectual property, then our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies is dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute or continue to prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against entities that are infringing upon these patents, or may pursue such enforcement less aggressively than we ordinarily would. Without adequate protection for the intellectual property that we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could unfavorably affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Two patents licensed from the John Hopkins University (the JHU Patents) expired in 2018, along with our License Agreement with the Johns Hopkins University. The expiration of the JHU Patents removes a barrier to entry for competitors who may be interested in selling a product competitive with Argus II. The JHU Patents are specific to retinal stimulation and have no effect on Orion technology.\nEven if issued, patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenges to the validity of our patents would require us to use resources to protect our technology and may prevent or delay our development, regulatory approval or commercialization of improvements in the Argus II System or new product candidates. Further, the validity of some of our patents has been challenged.\nPixium Vision (Pixium) has filed oppositions in the European Patent Office (EPO) challenging the validity of 22 European patents owned or exclusively licensed by Second Sight. Retina Implant AG has joined Pixium Vision in one opposition, and filed one separate opposition. Two of these patents are owned by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and exclusively licensed to Second Sight, while 20 of these patents are owned by Second Sight. Second Sight has opposed one Pixium patent. These EPO proceedings involving Pixium, Retina Implant, and Second Sight include:\n\u2022\nEP1061874 Visual Prosthesis - upheld by the opposition and appellate divisions. No further appeal is available in the EPO. This patent has recently expired.\n\u2022\nEP1061996 Apparatus for Preferential Outer Retinal Stimulation - upheld by the opposition division, cancelled in the appellate division. No further appeal is available in the EPO.\n\u2022\nEP1171188 Retinal Color Prosthesis for Color Sight Restoration - cancelled in the Opposition Division, we have withdrawn our appeal due to the patent\u2019s impending expiration.\n\u2022\nEP2219728 Electrode Array for Even Neural Pressure Having Multiple Attachment Points -upheld in the Opposition Division, pending before the Board of Appeal.\n\u2022\nEP1937352 Sub-threshold Stimulation to Precondition Neurons for Supra-threshold Stimulation - cancelled in the Opposition Division, pending before the Board of Appeal.\n\u2022\nEP2192949 - Return Electrode for a Flexible Circuit Electrode Array - cancelled in the Opposition Division, Pending before the Board of Appeal.\n\u2022\nEP1949437 - Implantable Microelectronic Device and Method of Manufacture -Upheld in the Opposition Division, appeal withdrawn.\n\u2022\nEP1945835 - Platinum Electrode Surface Coating and Method for Manufacturing the Same - (Pixium joined by Retina Implant) cancelled in the Opposition Division, We have not appealed in favor of pursuing claims in a divisional application.\n\u2022\nEP1986733 (Pixium\u2019s Patent opposed by Second Sight) - Device with Flexible Multilayer System for Contacting or Electro-stimulation of Living Tissue Cells or Nerves -significantly narrowed in the Opposition Division, pending before the Board of Appeal.\n\u2022\nEP1562672 - Field Focusing and Mapping in an Electrode Array - cancelled in the Opposition Division, we did not appeal.\n\u2022\nEP1497483 - Platinum Electrode - Upheld in the Opposition Division, no appeal has been filed.\n\u2022\nEP2077892 - Automatic Fitting for a Visual Prosthesis - Upheld in the Opposition Division, pending before the Board of Appeal.\n\u2022\nEP2061549 - Package for an Implantable Neural Stimulation Device - Cancelled in the Opposition Division, pending before the Board of Appeal.\n\u2022\nEP2155327 - System for Providing Stimulation Inputs to a Visual Prosthesis - Upheld in the Opposition Division. No appeal has been filed.\n\u2022\nEP2114514 - Flexible Electrode Array with Film Support - Opposition filed.\n\u2022\nEP2089100 - Flexible Circuit Electrode Array - Upheld in the Opposition Division, no appeal has been filed.\n\u2022\nEP2185236 - Implantable Device for the Brain - Upheld in the Opposition Division. Pending before the board of appeal.\n\u2022\nEP1843816 - Micro-Miniature Implantable Coated Device - Opposition filed, a hearing is scheduled for February 5, 2020. Opposed by Retina Implant.\n\u2022\nEP2364179 - Techniques and Functional Electrical Stimulation to Eliminate Discomfort during Electrical Stimulation of the Retina - Cancelled in the Opposition Division. Appeal is withdrawn.\n\u2022\nEP1874397 - Flexible Circuit Electrode Array - Upheld in modified form in the Opposition Division, we have appeal to restore the original patent.\n\u2022\nEP2136876 - Saliency-Based Apparatus for Visual Prosthesis - Cancelled in the Opposition Division, we did not appeal.\n\u2022\nEP2421602 - Visual Prosthesis Fitting System - Cancelled in the Opposition Division, we did not appeal.\n\u2022\nEP2167186 - Video Processing System for a Visual Prosthetic Apparatus - Opposition filed, a hearing is scheduled for March 19, 2019.\nIf we are the target of claims by third parties asserting that our products or intellectual property infringe upon the rights of others we may be forced to incur substantial expenses or divert substantial employee resources from our business and, if successful, those claims could result in our having to pay substantial damages or prevent us from developing one or more product candidates. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nThe validity of some of our patents has been challenged. If we experience patent infringement claims, or if we elect to avoid potential claims others may be able to assert, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third-party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding, regardless of its merit, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their having greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may, regardless of their merit, also absorb significant management time and employee resources.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third-parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe hold an exclusive license from the Doheny Eye Institute (DEI) to intellectual property relating to the Argus II visual prosthesis, and Orion cortical visual prosthesis. This license imposes various commercialization, milestone payment, profit sharing, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with any material obligations, DEI will have the right to terminate the license, which covers part of the Argus and Orion systems. The existing or future patents to which we have rights based on our agreements with DEI may be too narrow to prevent third-parties from developing or designing around these patents. Additionally, we may lose our exclusive rights to the patents and patent applications we license in the event of a breach or termination of the license agreement. The license expires with the expiration of the last of the licensed patents on August 8, 2033. The royalty in the agreement is 0.25% of the patented portion of Argus II System sales. All of the patents in the DEI agreement are co-owned by Second Sight and DEI. We license DEI\u2019s interest in the patents to maintain our exclusive use on that intellectual property. Should the license terminate, we retain the right to utilize the intellectual property, but may not be able to prevent others from doing so, in which case we may lose a competitive advantage.\nIf we are unable to protect the intellectual property used in our products, others may be able to copy our innovations which may impair our ability to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe strength of our patents involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. We have 384 issued patents and 58 pending patent applications worldwide as of December 31, 2018. Our patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents and our existing or future patents may be too narrow to prevent third-parties from developing or designing around our intellectual property and in that event we may lose competitive advantage and our business may suffer.\nFurther, the patent applications that we license or have filed may fail to result in issued patents. The claims may need to be amended. Even after amendment, a patent may not issue and in that event we may not obtain the exclusive use of the intellectual property that we seek and may lose competitive advantage which could result in harm to our business.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay expanded commercialization efforts for Argus II and our development and commercialization activities for other product candidates including Orion.\nAlthough we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to the Argus II System, the medical device industry is characterized by many litigation cases regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may in the future allege that our activities infringe their patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. We may not have identified all the patents, patent applications or published literature that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product, by preventing the patentability of one or more aspects of our products or those of our licensors or by covering the same or similar technologies that may affect our ability to market our product.\nIn addition, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third-parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain future licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nWe may become involved in future lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or of our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nThe US Patent and Trademark Office may initiate interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions described in or otherwise affecting our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the US.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face a risk of product liability claims arising from the prosthesis being inserted into the eye, and it is possible that we may be held liable for injuries of patients who receive our product. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forego further commercialization of one or more of our products. We maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials and commercial sales, with an aggregate coverage limit under these insurance policies of $10,000,000, and while we believe this amount of insurance currently is sufficient to cover our product liability exposure, these limits may not prove adequate to fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims, which could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of our products. If the use of our products harm or are alleged to harm people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims that exceed our policy limits and cause us significant losses that could seriously harm our financial condition or reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the health care system in the US and foreign jurisdictions may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a related reconciliation bill were signed into law. This legislation changes the current system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden coverage and control costs. The law also contains provisions that will affect companies in the medical device industry and other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices.\nMoreover, in some foreign countries, including countries in Europe and Canada, the pricing of approved medical devices is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. Our business could be materially harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nWe cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments appear likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the US and Europe. These reforms could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain timely regulatory approval for new products and on anticipated revenues from the Argus II System and other product candidates, both of which may affect our overall financial condition.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which could be as long as five years from November 14, 2014, the date of our initial public offering. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as\na result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile or may decline.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of this extended transition period, and as a result, we intend to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates that adoption of those standards may be required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. The report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results and cash flows could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe revenues we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe general commercial success of the Argus II System,\n\u2022\nour ability to improve performance and significantly expand the use of Argus II in the larger RP population by treating better-sighted RP patients,\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval of the Argus II System in additional jurisdictions,\n\u2022\nthe emergence of products that compete with our product candidates,\n\u2022\nour ability to leverage Argus II technology to restore useful vision with cortical stimulation,\n\u2022\nthe status of our preclinical and clinical development programs, variations in the level of expenses related to our existing product candidates or preclinical and clinical development programs,\n\u2022\nexecution of collaborative, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments received or made under those arrangements,\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuits to which we may become a party,\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain reimbursement from government or private payers at levels we deem adequate to sustain our operations.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that, in the near term, quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe will need additional capital to support our operations and growth. Additional capital may be difficult to obtain restricting our operations and resulting in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur business requires additional capital for implementation of our long term business plan. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and other investments, along with the proceeds of approximately $34.6 million from our completed shareholder rights offering of securities in February 2019, together with revenue generated from the sale of Argus II units, may be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of this report. The\nactual amount of funds that we will need for our business will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe amount of our future operating losses,\n\u2022\nthird party expenses relating to the ongoing commercialization of Argus II System,\n\u2022\nthe need and cost of conducting additional clinical trials of the Argus II System for other applications,\n\u2022\nthe amount of our research and development, including research and development for Orion visual prosthesis, marketing and general and administrative expenses, and\n\u2022\nregulatory changes and technological developments in our markets.\nIn November 2017, we entered into an At-the-Market sales agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with B. Riley FBR Inc. and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, as agents (\u201cAgents\u201d) pursuant to which the we may offer and sell, from time to time through either of the Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price as set forth in the Sales Agreement and a related prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We agreed to pay the Agents a cash commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of shares under the Sales Agreement. Through December 31, 2017 we sold 598,276 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $1.1 million under the Sales Agreement and thereafter during January and February 2018 we sold 2.2 million shares of common stock for additional net proceeds of $4.0 million. During 2018 we also sold privately in at the market transactions an aggregate of 15,725,291 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $22.0 million.\nAs we require additional funds, we may seek to fund our operations through the sale of additional equity securities, debt financing and strategic collaboration agreements. We cannot be sure that additional financing from any of these sources will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted. If we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, we may be required to cease or reduce further commercialization of the Argus II System, to cease or reduce certain research and development projects, to sell some or all of our technology or assets or business units or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have had a history of operating losses and we expect that operating losses will continue into the near term. Although we have had sales of the Argus II product, these limited sales have not been sufficient to cover our operating expenses. Our ability to generate positive cash flow will also hinge on our ability to correctly price our product to our markets, expand the use of the Argus II System, develop the Orion visual prosthesis and obtain government and private insurance reimbursement. As of December 31, 2018 we had total stockholders\u2019 equity of $3.1 million and an accumulated deficit of $269.5 million. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize our products. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Europe, and we anticipate that revenue from Europe and other countries outside the US will increase. Accordingly, our operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange variations,\n\u2022\nextended collection timelines for accounts receivable,\n\u2022\ngreater working capital requirements,\n\u2022\nmultiple legal frameworks and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements,\n\u2022\nthe need to ensure compliance with the numerous regulatory and legal requirements applicable to our business in each of these jurisdictions and to maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance with these requirements,\n\u2022\npolitical changes in the foreign governments impacting health policy and trade,\n\u2022\ntariffs, export restrictions, trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations that could impact our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets,\n\u2022\ntrade laws and business practices favoring local competition, and\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions, including the stability and solvency of business financial markets, financial institutions and sovereign nations and the healthcare expenditure of domestic or foreign nations.\nThe realization of any of these or other risks associated with operating in Europe or other non-US countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent domestic and foreign medical device regulation and any unfavorable regulatory action may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, and the safety and effectiveness of our medical devices. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign bodies for new products, or for enhancements, expansion of the indications or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u2022\ntake a significant, indeterminate amount of time,\n\u2022\nresult in product shortages due to regulatory delays,\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources,\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, and possibly post-market surveillance,\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products,\n\u2022\nrequire design changes of our products,\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of our products, and\n\u2022\nresult in our never being granted the regulatory approval we seek.\nAny of these occurrences that we might experience will cause our operations to suffer, harm our competitive standing and result in further losses that adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have ongoing responsibilities under FDA and international regulations, both before and after a product is commercially released. For example, we are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which mandates that manufacturers of medical devices adhere to certain quality assurance requirements pertaining among other things to validation of manufacturing processes, controls for purchasing product components, and documentation practices. As another example, the Medical Device Reporting regulation requires us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, that a malfunction occurred which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize such medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA has been increasing its scrutiny of the medical device industry and the government is expected to continue to scrutinize the industry closely with inspections and possibly enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies. Additionally, the FDA may restrict manufacturing and impose other operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe number of preclinical and clinical tests that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the disease or condition to be treated, the jurisdiction in which we are seeking approval and the regulations applicable to\nthat particular medical device. Regulatory agencies, including those in the US, Canada, Europe and other countries where medical devices are regulated, can delay, limit or deny approval of a product for many reasons. For example,\n\u2022\na medical device may not be safe or effective,\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may interpret data from preclinical and clinical testing differently than we do,\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may not approve our manufacturing processes,\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may conclude that our device does not meet quality standards for durability, long-term reliability, biocompatibility, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, and\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThe FDA may make requests or suggestions regarding conduct of our clinical trials, resulting in an increased risk of difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval in the US. Any of these occurrences could prove materially harmful to our operations and business.\nOur revenue from sales of Orion will be dependent upon the pricing and reimbursement guidelines adopted in each country and if pricing and reimbursement levels are inadequate to achieve profitability our operations will suffer.\nOur financial success is dependent on our ability to price our products in a manner acceptable to government and private payers while still maintaining our profit margins. Numerous factors that may be beyond our control may ultimately impact our pricing of Orion and determine whether we are able to obtain reimbursement or reimbursement at adequate levels from governmental programs and private insurance. If we are unable to obtain reimbursement or our product is not adequately reimbursed, we will experience reduced sales, our revenues likely will be adversely affected, and we may not become profitable.\nObtaining reimbursement approvals is time consuming, requires substantial management attention, and is expensive. Our business will be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of Orion under government programs and from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare Administrative Contractor level or by fiscal intermediaries in the US and by regional, or national funding agencies in Europe. Our business could be materially adversely affected if the Medicare program, local Medicare Administrative Contractors or fiscal intermediaries were to make such a determination and deny, restrict or limit the reimbursement of Orion. Similarly in Europe these governmental and other agencies could deny, restrict or limit the reimbursement of Orion at the hospital, regional or national level. Our business also could be adversely affected if surgeons and the facilities within which they operate are not adequately reimbursed by Medicare and other funding agencies for the cost of the procedure in which they implant the Orion on a basis satisfactory to the administering surgeons and their facilities. If the local contractors that administer the Medicare program and other funding agencies are slow to reimburse surgeons or provider facilities for the Argus II System, the surgeons and facilities may delay their payments to us, which would adversely affect our working capital requirements. Also if the funding agencies delay reimbursement payments to the hospitals, any increase to their working capital requirements could reduce their willingness to treat blind patients who wish to have our Orion devices implanted. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nIn order to obtain marketing approval for Orion we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Orion through clinical trials as well as additional supporting data. If Orion is associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon Orion\u2019s development, cause it to have reduced functionality, or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. We are conducting at UCLA and Baylor a six subject initial feasibility clinical study of Orion, but we cannot guarantee that any positive results in this limited trial will successfully translate to a pivotal clinical trial. It is not uncommon to observe results in human clinical trials that are unexpected based on limited trials testing, and many product candidates fail in large clinical trials despite promising limited clinical trial results. Moreover, clinical data is often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed\nsatisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products. No assurance can be given that we will not encounter similar results in our Orion trials.\nHuman subjects in our clinical trials may suffer significant adverse events, tolerability issues or other side effects associated with the surgical implantation, chronic implantation, and chronic use of the Orion device. These events include, but are not limited to, the following (events that are also anticipated during or following explantation of the Orion device are identified with an asterisk (*)): intracranial hemorrhage*; subcutaneous hematoma*; vascular injury causing stroke or hemorrhage (e.g. injury to the superior sagittal sinus or posterior cerebral artery perforators)*; hydrocephalus*; intracranial hypotension or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak*; headache or pain in the head, including deep pain*; tingling at the implant site*; brain edema*; infection*; meningitis*; implant site pain, swelling, discharge or effusion*; suture-related complications or stitch abscess*; skin erosion on and/or around the implant site; adverse tissue reaction to the implant; tissue damage at the implant/explant site*; cranial defect/bone damage*; decline in residual vision*; dizziness/syncope*; foreign body sensation at the implant site*; activation of motor or sensory neurons (e.g., muscle twitch); clinically symptomatic seizure*; development of epilepsy; coma*; death*; psychiatric events, including but not limited to mood changes, depression, suicidality, and psychosis*; neurological deficit, including but not limited to language (dysphemia), dysesthesias, paresis, parestthesia, visual field, motor deficit (including apraxia), and memory impairment*; drug hypersensitivity, adverse drug reaction, or therapeutic agent toxicity*; events related to any surgery and general anesthesia including cardiac risks, including stroke/transient ischemic attack, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and myocardial infarction*, venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease*; pneumonia*, urinary tract infection*, post-operative delirium*, postoperative constipation*, post-operative vomiting or nausea*, or post-operative fever*; injuries due to falls or bumps; skin irritation or burns; Orion system failure or malfunction; array migration; damage to the Orion electronics case; device interaction including the Orion device may interfere with the proper functioning of other electronic devices and emissions from other electronic equipment may interfere with the proper functioning of the Orion device; and (explant only) inability to remove all or part of the Orion device due to fibrosis or other reason.\nNo assurance can be given that we will not encounter adverse events in our Orion trials. The observed efficacy and extent of light perception and vision restoration for subjects implanted with Orion in our feasibility study may not be observed in a larger pivotal clinical trial. If general clinical trials of Orion fail to demonstrate efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Orion.\nFor example, in June 2018, one subject in our Early Feasibility Study for Orion (\u201cEFS\u201d) experienced a seizure while in the clinic when we were evaluating a specific video stimulation algorithm. The seizure resolved quickly with medication and the subject was released from the clinic without need for hospitalization or further treatment. The subject was allowed to continue using the Orion device after the serious adverse event was reviewed by a safety committee for the study and clinicians at the implanting institution.\nIn addition, for example, in January 2019 we observed higher impedance levels on 11 of 60 electrodes with the first EFS subject implanted with the Orion device in January 2018. As a result, some of these electrodes no longer generate a phosphene, or observable spot of light, for the subject. The subject continues to use the device and is continuing to participate in the clinical study. Mechanical and software safeguards are built into the device to avoid excessive electrical stimulation and, as a result, the higher impedance levels do not pose any known safety risks to the subject. We are currently investigating the possible cause(s) for the higher impedance levels, including any combination of the following: potential manufacturing defects, damage due to improper or excessive handling of the device, materials chosen for the design, and related processes. While our first subject has been implanted with the device for 12.5 months, one subject for 11.5 months and 4 subjects have been implanted for 10 months or less, we currently have no indication that the issue exists with any of the Orion devices implanted in each of the other five EFS subjects. Prior to initiation of EFS, we subjected six Orion implants to accelerated aging tests and had no failures for what was the equivalent of up to 6.5 years. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience similar or other issues with any of the implanted Orion devices, be able to determine the root cause of the issue or to ascertain whether the issue is isolated or systemic in nature. Additional testing, investigation, design changes or mitigation activities may delay our plans to conduct additional clinical studies for Orion and/or our marketing approval and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf device defects, significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting subjects to the clinical trial, subjects may drop out of our trial, or we may be required to abandon the trial or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of Orion at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Devices developed in the prosthesis industry that initially showed promise in early-stage studies have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude Orion from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its actual or perceived safety and tolerability profile. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nShould Orion obtain marketing approval, adverse effects associated with it may also develop after such approval and could lead to requirements for conducting additional clinical safety trials, placing additional warnings in the labeling, imposing significant restrictions on Orion, or withdrawing the Orion from the market while further incurring attendant costs of explants and exposure to litigation. We cannot predict whether Orion will cause significant adverse effects in humans that would preclude or lead to the revocation of regulatory approval. However, any such event, were it to occur, would cause substantial harm to our business and financial condition and would result in the diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nWe are also subject to stringent government regulation in European and other foreign countries, which could delay or prevent our ability to sell our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe intend to pursue market authorizations for the Argus II System and other product candidates in additional jurisdictions. For us to market our products in Europe and some other international jurisdictions, we and our distributors and agents must obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals. The approval procedure varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing, and the time and costs required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain an approval by the FDA. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. Violations of foreign laws governing use of medical devices may lead to actions against us by the FDA as well as by foreign authorities. We must also comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, efficacy and quality in those jurisdictions. We may not be able to obtain all the required regulatory registrations or approvals, or we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory registrations or approvals we receive. Delays in obtaining any registrations or approvals required for marketing our products, failure to receive these registrations or approvals, or future loss of previously obtained registrations or approvals would limit our ability to sell our products internationally. For example, international regulatory bodies have adopted various regulations governing product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. These regulations vary from country to country. In order to sell our products in Europe, we must maintain our ISO 13485:2003 certification and CE mark certification, which is an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. Failure to maintain the ISO 13485:2003 certification or CE mark certification or other international regulatory approvals would prevent us from selling in some countries in Europe and elsewhere. The failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business materially.\nEven if we obtain clearance or approval to sell our products, we are subject to ongoing requirements and inspections that could lead to the restriction, suspension or revocation of our clearance.\nWe, as well as any potential collaborative partners such as distributors, will be required to adhere to applicable FDA regulations regarding good manufacturing practice, which include testing, control, and documentation requirements. We are subject to similar regulations in foreign countries. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practice and other applicable regulatory requirements is strictly enforced in the United States through periodic inspections by state and federal agencies, including the FDA, and in international jurisdictions by comparable agencies. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure to obtain premarket clearance or premarket\napproval for devices, withdrawal of approvals previously obtained, and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would limit our ability to operate and could increase our costs.\nThe CE marking regulations are subject to a significant effort to strengthen the regulatory regime for medical devices which, if adopted, will make clearance process more time consuming and costly for us to obtain access to and continue to market within the European markets.\nWe are subject to an annual audit of compliance with the rules necessary to support our CE Mark. In April 2017 the European Commission adopted a new regulatory scheme that imposes significant additional obligations on medical device companies. As such, devices with a current CE marking have to comply with additional, more challenging regulatory obligations. The changes being made to the regulations include stricter requirements for clinical evidence and pre-market assessment of safety and performance, new classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third party testing by government accredited groups for some types of medical devices, and tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures. With the additional provisions adopted by the European Parliament, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) may be involved in regulation of some types of medical devices in the qualification and monitoring of notified bodies (NBs), and enhancing the roles of other bodies, including a new Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG). The European Parliament\u2019s revisions also impose enhanced competence requirements for NBs and \u201cspecial notified bodies\u201d (SNBs) for specific categories of devices, such as implantable devices. These changes are anticipated to result in stricter conformity assessment procedures. The medical device industry anticipates that there will be significant changes under these initiatives to the regulation of medical devices which will increase the time and costs for obtaining CE marking. We will be audited to this new standard in 2020.\nOur CE Mark registration must be renewed on a periodic basis. Our current CE Mark registration will expire on September 1, 2019, if not renewed. If we fail to successfully renew our CE Mark registration, we will not be able to sell Argus II in most international markets after September 1, 2019. Further, the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) is a new multi-national standard adopted by Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the European Union. MDSAP may impose a higher compliance burden than CE Mark through more rigorous audit requirements. If we do not comply with the new MDSAP standard, we will not be able to sell Argus II in Canada after December 31, 2019.\nWe have no large-scale manufacturing experience, which could limit our growth.\nOur limited manufacturing experience may not enable us to make products in the volumes that would be necessary for us to achieve a significant amount of commercial sales. Our product involves new and technologically complex materials and processes and we currently experience low yields on our manufacturing process. As we move from making small quantities of our product for clinical trials to larger quantities for greater commercial distribution, we must develop new manufacturing techniques and processes that allow us to scale production. We may not be able to establish and maintain reliable, efficient, full scale manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs in a timely fashion. Difficulties we encounter in manufacturing scale-up, or our failure to implement and maintain our manufacturing facilities in accordance with good manufacturing practice regulations, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, could result in a delay or termination of production. To date, our manufacturing activities have largely been to provide units for clinical testing and commercial sales of the Argus II System. We may face substantial difficulties in establishing and maintaining manufacturing for our products at a larger commercial scale and those difficulties may impact the quality of our products and adversely affect our ability to increase sales.\nTo establish our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience delays or other difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies evolve, we will need to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Our management team may have to use a substantial amount of time to manage these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize the Argus II System and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability timely and effectively to manage any future growth and related costs. We may not be able to effectively manage a rapid pace of growth and timely implement improvements to our management infrastructure and control systems.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third-parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize value from expected synergies. We cannot assure that, following an acquisition, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies the acquisition.\nOur ability to utilize and benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state of California income tax net operating loss carryforwards, which may be applied to future taxable income, of approximately $69.4 million and $42.5 million, respectively. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until these unused losses expire. However, we may be unable to use these losses to offset taxable income before our unused losses expire at various dates that range from 2035 through 2038 for federal net operating losses and from 2033 through 2038 for state net operating losses. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited. Limitations may also apply to the utilization of other pre-change tax attributes as a result of an ownership change.\nWe experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the second quarter of 2017. The ownership change will subject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which will significantly restrict its ability to use them to offset taxable income in periods following the ownership change. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our stock at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a tax-exempt interest rate specified by the Internal Revenue Service. We have analyzed the available information to determine the amount of the annual limitation. Based on information available us, the 2017 limitation is estimated to range between be $1.4 million and $3.7 million annually. In total, we estimate that the 2017 ownership change will result in approximately $120 million and $56 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused.\nRisks Related to the Securities Market, and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nMedical technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading prices of our common stock have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose substantially all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new offerings, products, services, therapies, treatments or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nchallenges to our patents and the patents and intellectual property that we license,\n\u2022\nUnited States and European approvals or denials of our products,\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time,\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of medical device or technology companies in general,\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float,\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations,\n\u2022\nwhether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors,\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts,\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both,\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both,\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends,\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events,\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock,\n\u2022\ndepartures of key employees, or\n\u2022\nan adverse impact on our business from any of the other risks cited herein.\nIn addition, if the market for medical technology stocks or the stock market, in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq. In order to maintain this listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including a minimum closing bid price requirement for our common stock of $1.00 per share. In January 2019, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market advising us that for 30 consecutive trading days preceding the date of the letter, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the $1.00 per share minimum required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to listing rules, and therefore we could become subject to delisting if we did not regain compliance within the compliance period (or the compliance period as may be extended). There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to comply with the applicable listing standards. Although Nasdaq may provide us with a compliance period in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, we cannot assure you that we would be able to regain compliance within the period provided by Nasdaq. In order to regain compliance with such requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock would need to meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days during the compliance period. If we were not able to regain compliance within the allotted compliance period for this requirement or any other applicable listing standard, including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, our shares of common stock would be subject to delisting. In the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, our ability to fund our business plan may be adversely affected and it could become more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate price quotations for our common stock and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or private markets could reduce the price of our common stock and may dilute your voting power and ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public or private markets, or the perception that these sales could occur, as well as sales of shares by directors or officers, which have occurred or which may occur from time to time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nEntities controlled by Gregg Williams, our Chairman of the Board, have the ability to influence or control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval, may limit your ability to influence outcomes of director elections and may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders.\nAs of February 22, 2019, entities controlled and beneficially owned by Gregg Williams, our Chairman of the Board, own of record an aggregate of approximately 62.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (or 73.0% after giving effect to Mr. Williams\u2019 right to acquire beneficial ownership of 48,239,184 shares of common stock upon exercise of options or warrants). As a result, Mr. Williams is able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. Mr. Williams may also have interests that differ from other stockholders and he may vote in a manner that is or could be deemed as adverse to interests of other stockholders. His majority stock ownership could discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our\nstock price. This concentration of voting power may have the effect of deterring, delaying or impeding actions that could be beneficial to other stockholders.\nWe have obtained significant invested amounts from entities affiliated with Mr. Williams, our Chairman of the Board, and if as we seek additional funding to support our business Mr. Williams does not participate in our future offerings, we may not be able to raise needed amounts and our operations may be adversely affected.\nDuring 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we funded our business primarily through the issuance and sale of our securities. We obtained approximate proceeds of $9,000,000 in 2016, $10,000,000 in 2017, $10,000,000 in May 2018, $5,000,000 in August 2018, $4,000,000 in October 2018, $3,000,000 in December 2018 and $30,000,000 in February 2019 from the sale of our securities to entities affiliated with Mr. Williams, our Chairman of the Board, constituting 45.5%, 49.8%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 100% and 86.7% respectively, of amounts received in the offerings we completed. To the extent that we may need additional capital we expect that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic partnerships or other sources. No assurance can be given that Mr. Williams or entities affiliated with him will continue to participate in any offerings of our securities or that we will be able to obtain additional capital from him. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nFuture sales and issuances of our equity securities or rights to purchase our equity securities, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, would result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities; our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe public market for our common stock has been volatile since completion of our initial public offering in November 2014. This volatility may affect the ability of our investors to sell their shares as well as the price at which they sell their shares.\nWe completed our initial public offering in November 2014. Since that time, closing prices of our shares have ranged from $0.69 per share to $23.60 per share and day-to-day trading often has been volatile. This volatility may continue or increase in the future. The market price for the shares may be significantly affected by factors such as progress in the development of our technology, progress in our pre-clinical and clinical trials, agreements with research facilities or co-development partners, commercialization of our technology, coverage by third party payers, variations in quarterly and yearly operating results, general trends in the medical device industry, and changes in FDA and foreign regulations affecting us and our industry. Furthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Those broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our common stockholders (including those persons who may become common stockholders upon exercise of our options or warrants) sell substantial amounts of our common stock, or the public market perceives that stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems appropriate.\nWe have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock are presently issued and outstanding and we have no immediate plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could adversely reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of our common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, to the detriment of the holders of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 15062, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "EYES"}
