{"cik": "886835", "company": "SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the matters contained under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects, as well as the market value of our securities, or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. These risks include:\nRisks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases\nDespite having emerged from bankruptcy on February 2, 2021, we continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with residual Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs discussed below (see Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), we emerged from bankruptcy on the Emergence Date. It is possible that having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the bankruptcy could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, vendors, employees, service providers and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022vendors or other contract counterparties could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022the ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022the ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nBecause of the residual risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, the ultimate impact that events that occurred during, or that may occur subsequent to, these proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations going forward.\nOur actual financial results since we emerged from bankruptcy are not comparable to the Predecessor's historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, projected financial information through the end of 2023 was prepared to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. The failure of any such results, or any other developments contemplated by the Plan, to materialize, or of any such results or developments to have the anticipated effect on us and our subsidiaries or our business or operations, could materially adversely impact our business and prospects as a post-emergence company.\nIn addition, as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting and adjusted our assets and liabilities to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero and reflected in our financial statements for the quarter ending March 31,\n2021. We became a new entity for financial reporting purposes on February 2, 2021 (the \u201cEmergence Date\u201d). Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in historical financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business depends on conditions in the oil and gas industry, especially oil and natural gas prices and capital expenditures by oil and gas companies.\nOur business depends on the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and gas companies worldwide. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and difficult to predict and are likely to continue to be volatile. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, economic growth trends, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Price volatility continued throughout 2019 and, partially due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and failure of OPEC+ and other major producers to agree on production cuts, became more extreme in 2020 and 2021. In addition, oil prices are particularly sensitive to actual and perceived threats to global political stability and to changes in production from OPEC+ member states. The ongoing conflict, and the continuation of, or any increase in, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has led and may continue to lead to an increase in the volatility of global oil and gas prices, which could have a corresponding negative impact on the capital expenditure of oil and gas companies as a result of the higher perceived risk. In addition, the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against Russia (including in relation to the Russian energy sector) as well as the announcement of prohibitions on Russian oil and gas imports by certain members of the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and certain other countries, as of March 2022, including additional countries that may enforce prohibitions of a similar nature in the future, has led to and is expected to continue to lead to an increase in the price of global oil and gas prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers, while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending up to a point. Our customers may also take into account the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other risk factors and require higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could significantly affect the demand for oil and natural gas, which could affect the level of capital spending by our customers and in turn could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, expectations about future oil and natural gas demand and prices, the stage of reservoir development, the availability of financing, and political and regulatory environments are also expected to affect levels of exploration, development, and production activity, which would impact the demand for our services. Any prolonged reduction of oil and natural gas prices, as well as anticipated declines, could also result in lower levels of exploration, development, and production activity.\nThe demand for our services may be affected by numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022demand for energy, which is affected by worldwide economic activity, population growth and market expectations regarding future trends;\n\u2022the ability of OPEC+ and other key oil-producing countries to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022the level of excess production capacity;\n\u2022the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022domestic and global political and economic uncertainty, socio-political unrest and instability, terrorism or hostilities;\n\u2022weather conditions and changes in weather patterns, including summer and winter temperatures that impact demand;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u2022oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency;\n\u2022the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u2022demand for and availability of alternative, competing sources of energy;\n\u2022the extent to which taxes, tax credits, environmental regulations, auctions of mineral rights, drilling permits, drilling concessions, drilling moratoriums or other governmental regulations, actions or policies affect the production, cost of production, price or availability of petroleum products and alternative energy sources;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy exploration, production and consumption; and\n\u2022raw material inflation and availability.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by significantly reduced demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. Sustained lower oil and natural gas prices have led to a significant decrease in spending by our customers over the past several years, which have led to significantly decreased revenues. Further decreases in oil and natural gas prices could lead to further cuts in spending and potential lower revenues for us. Moreover, weakness in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the financial position of our customers, which in turn could cause them to fail to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner or at all. We expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices (including the possibilities that such prices could remain at current levels or decline further for an extended period of time), as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, decisions of OPEC+ and other oil exporting nations regarding production, and the other factors listed above. Any of these events have affected, and could further affect, the demand for oil and natural gas and has and could further have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business may also be affected by new sanctions and export controls targeting Russia and other responses to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nAs a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, certain members of the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, among others, have developed coordinated sanctions and export-control measure packages.\nBased on actions taken and other public statements to date, these packages may include:\n\u2022comprehensive financial sanctions against certain state-owned enterprises and Russian banks (including SWIFT cut-off);\n\u2022a prohibition on transactions related to the Russian Central Bank;\n\u2022additional designations of Russian individuals with significant business interests and government connections;\n\u2022designations of individuals and entities involved in Russian military activities;\n\u2022restrictions on investment in the Russian energy sector;\n\u2022enhanced export controls and trade sanctions targeting Russia's import of certain goods and technology; and\n\u2022closure of airspace to Russian aircraft.\nAs the invasion of Ukraine continues, there can be no certainty regarding whether such governments or other governments will impose additional sanctions, export-controls or other economic or military measures against Russia. Although, we have minimal operational exposure in Russia, representing less than $0.2 million of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, and we do not intend to commit further capital towards projects in Russia, the impact the invasion of Ukraine, including economic sanctions and export controls or additional war or military conflict, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect oil and gas companies, including many of which are our customers, as well as the global supply chain. In addition, the continuation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia could lead to other disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets and industries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. We cannot assure you that cash on hand, letters of credit under the Credit Facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations.\nFurthermore, turmoil in the credit and financial markets could adversely affect financial institutions, inhibit lending and limit our access to funding through borrowings under the Credit Facility or obtaining other financing in the public or private capital markets on terms we believe to be reasonable. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by the ongoing disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, low commodity prices or other factors impacting our business, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad. Instability in the global financial markets has from time to time resulted in periodic volatility in the capital markets. In addition, there has been a relatively recent increased focus of debt and equity capital providers on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investing, and the energy industry faces growing negative sentiment in the market. This volatility, as well as this increased focus on ESG investing and growing negative sentiment, could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are\nacceptable to us, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize our ability to repay, refinance or reduce our debt obligations, or to meet our other financial commitments.\nRestrictive covenants in the Credit Facility could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nThe Credit Facility imposes operating and financial restrictions. Unless all loans are paid off and letters of credit outstanding are cash collateralized and the Credit Agreement terminated, these restrictions limit the ability to, among other things, subject to permitted exceptions:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make investments or loans;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes;\n\u2022make restricted payments;\n\u2022make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe restrictions contained in the Credit Facility could:\n\u2022limit the ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022adversely affect the ability to finance our operations or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nThe Credit Facility includes provisions that require mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings and/or a borrowing base redetermination when there are asset dispositions over a certain threshold, which could limit the ability to generate liquidity from asset sales. Also, the Credit Facility requires compliance with a specified financial ratio if triggered by an event of default or availability beneath specified thresholds. The ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, this ratio may not be met in circumstances when it is tested. This financial ratio restriction could limit the ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a continued downturn in our business or a downturn in the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Declines in oil and natural gas prices could result in failure to meet one or more of the financial covenants under the Credit Facility, which could require refinancing or amendment of such obligations resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require a capital raise at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable.\nA breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under the Credit Facility. A default under the Credit Facility, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder and/or a requirement to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, and the ultimate effect on our operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material impact on businesses around the world and the economic environments in which they operate. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented severe restrictions on the movement of their respective populations. The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its effect have had a substantial negative impact on the global economy and demand for oil, which has directly affected our business and progress of the Transformation Project. Although oil prices are back to pre-pandemic levels, driven by global vaccine distribution, an unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ agreement on production volume, and a declining production base, if the demand for or price of crude oil does not further increase, our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity may be further materially and adversely affected. Our operations also may be further adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce continue to be unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and certain related government mandated restrictions and limitations on business activities have caused disruptions and delays, which have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, and could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of machinery, equipment, consumables, parts and vehicles. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nare currently experiencing and may continue to experience shortages and delays in the shipments of key machinery, parts and consumables from our suppliers. If any of the foregoing were to continue to occur, we may not be able to find alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms or a timely basis, if at all. Any prolonged or subsequent disruptions or delays in our equipment, consumables, parts and other machinery, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe believe that the well-known impacts described above and other potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022customers may attempt to cancel or delay projects or may attempt to invoke force majeure clauses in certain contracts resulting in a decreased or delayed demand for our products and services;\n\u2022customers may also seek to delay payments, may default on payment obligations and/or seek bankruptcy protection that could delay or prevent collections of certain accounts receivable;\n\u2022a need to preserve liquidity and volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022reduction of our global workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022liabilities resulting from operational delays due to decreased productivity resulting from stay-at-home orders affecting the work force or facility closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022liabilities resulting from an inability to perform services due to limited manpower availability or an inability to travel to perform the services;\n\u2022emergence of more infectious strains of the virus, vaccine hesitancy or increased business and social activities leading to increased spread of the virus;\n\u2022other contractual or other legal claims from our customers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties.\nAt this time, it is not possible to quantify these risks, but the combination of these factors could have a further material impact on our financial results. The ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These future developments include, but are not limited to, vaccine availability and acceptance, the effectiveness of vaccines against different strains of COVID-19, the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Disruptions and/or uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in, and have resulted to date in, delays or modifications to our strategic plans and initiatives and could hinder our ability to achieve our strategic goals. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, will likely have the effect of heightening many of the other risks included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, because the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and continuously evolving, the other potential impacts to our risk factors are uncertain.\nThere are operating hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry that could expose us to substantial liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside of our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and other service providers. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Any of these events can be the result of human error or purely accidental, and it may be difficult or impossible to definitively determine the ultimate cause of the event or whose personnel or equipment contributed thereto. All of these risks expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks and potentially substantial litigation claims for damages. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed in more challenging exploration, development and production locations. From time to time, customers and third parties may seek to hold us accountable for damages and costs incurred as a result of an accident, including pollution, even under circumstances where we believe we did not cause or contribute to the accident. Our insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions, and may not protect us against liability for some types of events, including events involving a well blowout, or against losses from business interruption. Our insurance also may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate or on terms that we deem commercially reasonable,\nor at all. Any damages or losses that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles or retentions, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be fully indemnified against losses incurred due to catastrophic events.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment or property, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. In addition, our indemnification rights may not fully protect us if we cannot prove that we are entitled to be indemnified or if the customer is bankrupt or insolvent, does not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise does not possess sufficient resources to indemnify us. In addition, our indemnification rights may be held unenforceable in some jurisdictions.\nOur customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nThe credit risks of our customer base could result in losses.\nMany of our customers are oil and gas companies that are facing liquidity constraints in light of the current commodity price environment. These customers impact our overall exposure to credit risk as they are also affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. If a significant number of our customers experience a prolonged business decline or disruptions, we may incur increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts.\nWe are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, which could reduce our business opportunities and revenue, and increase our costs and liabilities.\nOur business is significantly affected by a wide range of environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate, including increasingly rigorous environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. Generally, these laws and regulations have become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties. The Macondo well explosion in 2010 resulted in additional regulation of our offshore operations, and similar onshore or offshore accidents in the future could result in additional increases in regulation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. For example, our well service and fluids businesses routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous substances. We also store, transport and use radioactive and explosive materials in certain of our operations. In addition, many of our current and former facilities are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use of radioactive materials, the use of underground injection wells, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new domestic or foreign laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.\nIn addition, we and our customers may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us and our customers to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce.\nIncreasing concerns that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) may endanger public health and produce climate changes with significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events, have drawn significant attention from government agencies, environmental advocacy groups and technological initiatives aimed at reducing the use of hydrocarbons. In response, additional costly requirements and restrictions have been imposed on the oil and gas industry to regulate and reduce the emission of GHGs and transition to a global low carbon economy.\nSpecifically, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act which increase operational costs by requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from oil and gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States. Although the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, significant legislation has not yet been adopted to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions through the completion of GHG emissions inventories and through cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting GHGs. Other non-U.S. governmental bodies such as the European Union have implemented similar policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions, including but not limited to carbon taxes, cap and trade programs, renewable fuel mandates, or other regulations targeting carbon intensive activities. Given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal and international GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility.\nClimate change, environmental, social and governance, and sustainability are growing global movements. Continuing political and social attention to these issues has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures, as well as society pressure in some areas, to limit GHG emissions and has been stated in the U.S. to be a priority of the new Biden Administration, as well as other initiatives. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that proposed an agreement (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d) requiring member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016. The United States is one of over 120 nations having ratified or otherwise consented to the agreement; however this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. Although the prior administration formally withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, the new administration issued an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on January 20, 2021, effective on February 19, 2021.\nIn addition to governmental regulations, our customers are also requiring additional equipment upgrades to address the growing concerns of GHG emission and climate change which result in higher operational costs for service providers such as us. Despite taking additional measures to reduce GHG emissions, there is the possibility that the demand for fossil fuels may nevertheless decrease due to such concerns.\nFurthermore, there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. If these efforts are successful, our ability and the ability of our customers to access capital markets may be limited.\nAt this stage, we cannot predict the impact of these or other initiatives on our or our customers\u2019 operations, nor can we predict whether, or which of, other currently pending GHG emission proposals will be adopted, or what other actions may be taken by domestic or international regulatory bodies. The potential passage of climate change regulation may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our products and services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.\nAdverse and unusual weather conditions may affect our operations.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. Severe weather, such as hurricanes, high winds and seas, blizzards and extreme temperatures may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension of operations, inability to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules, loss of or damage to equipment and facilities and reduced productivity. In addition, variations from normal weather patterns can have a significant impact on demand for oil and natural gas, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.\nOur inability to retain key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect our operations.\nOur performance could be adversely affected, especially in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, if we are unable to retain certain key employees and skilled technical personnel. Our ability to continue to expand the scope of our services and products depends in part\non our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to employ or retain skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operating results. In the past, the demand for skilled personnel has been high and the supply limited. We may also face a loss of workers and labor shortages as a result of vaccine mandates or requirements and enforcement of other COVID-19 regulations in jurisdictions where we operate. We have experienced increases in labor costs in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, these internal and external factors may also be impacted by our recent emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing us and the business environment and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances.\nWe face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives. There is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. If we are unable to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for key executives if their services are no longer available. Furthermore, our business could be affected adversely if suitable replacement personnel are not recruited quickly or effectively. Our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.\nOur international operations and revenue are affected by political, economic and other uncertainties worldwide.\nOur international operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we provide services. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time. Future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes or interpretations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver services within various foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, our international operations are subject to a number of other risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022political, social and economic instability;\n\u2022potential expropriation, seizure, deprivation, confiscation or nationalization of assets, or other governmental actions;\n\u2022inflation;\n\u2022deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022increased operating costs;\n\u2022inability to collect receivables and longer receipt of payment cycles;\n\u2022social unrest and protests, strikes, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u2022import-export quotas or restrictions, including tariffs and the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u2022confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022currency exchange controls;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions;\n\u2022potential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel;\n\u2022pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or epidemics that disrupt our ability to transport personnel or equipment;\n\u2022embargoes or other restrictive governmental actions that could limit our ability to operate in foreign countries;\n\u2022trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States or other regions or countries;\n\u2022additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022restrictions on the repatriation of funds;\n\u2022limitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022the risk that our international customers may have reduced access to credit because of higher interest rates, reduced bank lending or a deterioration in our customers\u2019 or their lenders\u2019 financial condition;\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations;\n\u2022the imposition of unanticipated or increased environmental and safety regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses;\n\u2022complications associated with installing, operating and repairing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property;\n\u2022the geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world; and\n\u2022challenges in staffing and managing international operations.\nThese and the other risks outlined above could cause us to curtail or terminate operations, result in the loss of personnel or assets, disrupt financial and commercial markets and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. International areas where we operate that have significant risk include the Middle East, Indonesia, Nigeria and Angola.\nLaws, regulations or practices in foreign countries could materially restrict our operations or expose us to additional risks.\nIn many countries around the world where we do business, all or a significant portion of the decision making regarding procuring our services and products is controlled by state-owned oil companies. State-owned oil companies or prevailing laws may (i) require us to meet local content or hiring requirements or other local standards, (ii) restrict with whom we can contract or (iii) otherwise limit the scope of operations that we can legally or practically conduct. Our inability or failure to meet these requirements, standards or restrictions may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms, and to enforce those terms. In addition, many state-owned oil companies may require integrated contracts or turnkey contracts that could require us to provide services outside our core businesses. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally requires us to assume additional risks.\nMoreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures or strategic alliances with local contractors, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local contractors, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local contractors, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under the FCPA, or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local contractors, partners or agents even though these contractors, partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\nIf we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for oilfield services in which we operate is highly competitive and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases.\nSome of the materials that we use are obtained from a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, supply chain disruptions, inferior quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply in a timely manner. We do not have long-term contracts with most of these sources, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these materials could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nEstimates of our potential liabilities relating to our oil and natural gas property may be incorrect.\nActual abandonment expenses may vary substantially from those estimated by us and any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated liability recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the risk exists we may underestimate the cost of plugging wells and abandoning production facilities. If costs of abandonment are materially greater than our estimates, this could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential changes of Bureau of Ocean Energy Management security and bonding requirements for offshore platforms could impact our operating cash flows and results of operations.\nFederal oil and natural gas leases contain standard terms and require compliance with detailed Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (\u201cBSEE\u201d) and BOEM regulations and orders issued pursuant to various federal laws, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. In 2016, BOEM undertook a review of its historical policies and procedures for determining a lessee\u2019s ability to decommission platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (\u201cOCS\u201d) and whether lessees should furnish additional security, and in July 2016, BOEM issued a new Notice to Lessees requiring additional security for decommissioning activities. In January 2017, BOEM extended the implementation timeline for properties with co-lessees by an additional six months, and in June 2017 announced that the Notice to Lessees would be stayed while BOEM continued to review its implementation issues and continued industry engagement to gather additional information on the financial assurance program.\nDuring the second half of 2016, BSEE increased its estimates of many offshore operator\u2019s decommissioning costs, including the decommissioning costs at our sole federal offshore oil and gas property, in which our subsidiary owns a 51% non-operating interest. In October 2016, BOEM sent an initial proposal letter to the operator of the oil and gas property, proposing an increase in the supplemental bonding requirement for the property\u2019s sole fixed platform that was eight to ten times higher than the revised supplemental bonding requirement requested for any other deep-water fixed platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Both the operator and our subsidiary submitted formal dispute notices, asserting that the estimates in the October 2016 proposal letter may be based on erroneous or arbitrary estimates of the potential decommissioning costs, and requesting in-person meetings to discuss the estimate. We asked that BSEE and BOEM reduce the estimate to an amount that more closely approximates actual decommissioning costs, consistent with estimates identified by BSEE and BOEM for similar deep-water platforms. BSEE and BOEM have not yet responded to our dispute notice.\nOn September 17, 2020, BOEM issued a proposed rule addressing OCS oil and gas decommissioning costs (BOEM-2018-0033). The proposed rule contains updated criteria for determining decommissioning costs. Under the proposed rule, BOEM would only require additional security when (1) a lessee or grant holder poses a substantial risk of becoming financially unable to meet its obligations; (2) there is no co-lessee, co-grant holder or predecessor that is liable for those obligations with sufficient financial capacity; and (3) the property is at or near the end of its productive life. BSEE would typically issue orders to predecessors in title in a reverse chronological order. The proposed rule would also require that a party appealing any final decommissioning decision or order provide a surety bond to ensure that funding for decommissioning is available if the order is affirmed and the liable party then defaults. Based on the proposed framework, BOEM estimates its amount of financial assurance would decrease from $3.3 billion to $3.1 billion, although BOEM expects the rule would provide greater protection as the financial assurance would be focused on the riskiest properties.\nWe cannot predict when these laws and regulations may be adopted or change in the future, particularly as a result of the U.S. presidential administration changing in January 2021. If BOEM withdraws the September 2020 rule proposal and proceeds to implement a rule or other regulatory action requiring additional security similar to the Notice to Lessees issued in July 2016 and we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds or post other acceptable security to secure of decommissioning obligations, BOEM may suspend or cancel operations at the oil and gas property or otherwise impose monetary penalties. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows and liquidity.\nMoreover, under existing BOEM and BSEE rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interests may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning of OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by BOEM, in the event that the assignee or any subsequent assignee is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOn the Emergence Date, in order to implement certain transactions contemplated by the Plan, the Stockholders Agreement was executed with each stockholder pursuant to the Plan (constituting all of the stockholders on the Emergence Date) and all other stockholders from time to time, to provide for certain of our governance matters. Two groups of these stockholders currently hold approximately 50.5% of our Class A Common Stock. Furthermore, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, these two groups of stockholders have appointed three of our six directors.\nCircumstances may arise in which these groups of stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with our interests.\nThere is no public market for shares of our Class A Common Stock, and we do not expect there to be a market for shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nThere is no existing trading market for shares of our Class A Common Stock, and no market for our shares may develop in the future. If developed, any such market may not be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, our stockholders may be unable to liquidate an investment in our Class A Common Stock. Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the Predecessor\u2019s common stock was canceled and we issued new Class A Common Stock. The Class A Common Stock is not currently traded on a national securities exchange. There is no active market in the Class A Common Stock. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for our Class A Common Stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for our Class A Common Stock. Our Class A Common Stock may be traded only infrequently, if at all, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our Class A Common Stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our Class A Common Stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. For so long as our Class A Common Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, our ability to access equity markets, obtain financing and provide equity incentives could be negatively impaired. Furthermore, certain transfers of our Class A Common Stock require an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nProvisions in the Stockholders Agreement could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our Stockholders Agreement may delay, discourage, prevent or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of us, whether through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022permit two groups of our stockholders to elect up to three members of our Board of Directors and limit the removal of such directors; and\n\u2022restrict certain transfers (including acquisitions and dispositions) of our securities.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is restricted.\nWe currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to finance our operations. As a result, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, industry trends and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Any such decision will also be subject to compliance with contractual restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness.\nWe do not have a class of our securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Until we do, we will not be required to provide certain reports to our stockholders.\nWe do not have a class of our securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Until we do, we will not be required to provide certain reports to our stockholders. We are currently required to file periodic reports with the SEC by virtue of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. However, until we register a class of our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s proxy rules, and large holders of our capital stock will not be subject to beneficial\nownership reporting requirements under Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act and their related rules. As a result, our stockholders and potential investors may not have available to them as much or as robust information as they may have if and when we become subject to those requirements.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We may in the future become subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us.\nAny litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities could impact our operating results. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization. If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective income tax rate could be impacted. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each taxing jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding future operations and results and the timing of income and expenses. We may be audited and receive tax assessments from taxing authorities that may result in assessment of additional taxes that are ultimately resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operating may be adversely impacted.\nWe are affected by global economic factors and political events.\nOur financial results depend on demand for our services and products in the U.S. and the international markets in which we operate. Declining economic conditions, negative perceptions about economic conditions, energy costs and supply chain disruptions, could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our services and products. World political events could also result in further U.S. military actions, terrorist attacks and related unrest. Military action by the U.S. or other nations could escalate and further acts of terrorism may occur in the U.S. or elsewhere. Such acts of terrorism could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees, extortion or kidnapping, and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations. Such developments have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past, and many experts believe that a confluence of worldwide factors could result in a prolonged period of economic uncertainty and slow growth in the future. In addition, any of these developments could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and gas and could negatively affect the markets for our products and services. Insurance premiums could also increase and coverages may be unavailable.\nUncertain economic conditions and instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and may affect demand for many of our services and products. Consequently, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on demand for our services and products and our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations may be subject to cyber-attacks that could have an adverse effect on our business operations.\nLike most companies, we rely heavily on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to manage or support a variety of our business operations, and to maintain various records, which may include information regarding our customers, employees or other third parties, and the integrity of these systems are essential for us to conduct our business and operations. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems (and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or system disruptions). However, we cannot provide assurance that our security efforts and measures will prevent security threats from materializing, unauthorized access to our systems,\nloss or destruction of data, account takeovers, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events, whether caused by mechanical failures, human error, fraud, malice, sabotage or otherwise. We have office employees who work remotely. Remote work relies heavily on the use of remote networking and online conferencing services that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access and other cybersecurity related incidents. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which could go unnoticed for a prolonged period of time. While various procedures and controls are being utilized to mitigate exposure to such risk, there can be no assurance that the procedures and controls that we implement, or which we cause third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. Additionally, customers as well as other third parties upon whom we rely face similar cybersecurity threats, which could directly or indirectly impact our business and operations. The frequency, scope and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, which increases the possibility that our security measures will be unable to prevent our systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of proprietary information. Any failure of our information or communication systems, whether caused by attacks, mechanical failures, natural disasters or otherwise, could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or subject us to claims, any of which could materially adversely affect us.", "PERMNO": 77763, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "SPN"}
