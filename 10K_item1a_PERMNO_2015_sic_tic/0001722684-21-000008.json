Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19 and Our Industry\nThe effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) have disrupted the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, which have had and are expected to continue to have a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations outlook, plans, growth and stock price.\nSince first being identified in December 2019, COVID-19 has continued to have an unprecedented impact on the global economy and the hospitality industry due to the implementation of a wide variety of control measures including states of emergency, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, border closures, and restrictions on travel and large gatherings. These measures have resulted in cancelled and reduced travel and complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations and hotel closures for an indefinite period, including ongoing disruptions to the operations of our franchisees, property owners and us, all of which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative adverse effect on our business, financial condition, including cash flow and liquidity, results of operations, outlook, plans, growth and stock price.\nCOVID-19 has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022Revenues and Expenses: Due to the spread of COVID-19, we have experienced significant decreases in demand and RevPAR. The negative effects of COVID-19 have negatively impacted, and are expected to continue to negatively impact, our revenues and profitability and the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our franchised and managed properties. The impact of COVID-19 is making it difficult for our franchisees and property owners to satisfy operating needs and could make it difficult for them to satisfy their debt obligations to us or others or obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could generally impact their cost and our ability to increase revenue in the future. In addition, if a significant number of hotels exit our system as a result of COVID-19, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected. COVID-19 could also materially impact other non-hotel related sources of revenues for us, including, for example, our fees from our co-branded credit card arrangement or our license fee revenues. We could be further required to test our intangible assets or goodwill for further impairments due to reduced revenues or cash flows.\n\u2022Operations: Due to the significant decrease in travel demand, we have taken actions and continue to evaluate opportunities for managing our operating expenses and conserving our financial resources, including the actions described in this Report. Given the uncertainty relating to COVID-19, we may have to take additional actions in the future, which cannot be predicted.\n\u2022Financial Condition and Indebtedness: Since the beginning of COVID-19, our level of indebtedness has increased and may continue to increase. In April 2020, we amended our credit agreement to waive the quarterly debt covenant testing requirement until the first quarter of 2021. The calculation was also modified to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021 to use annualized EBITDA in each quarter. An event of default under our credit agreement would enable our lenders to terminate their commitments and would trigger consequences under other indebtedness or financial instruments. Additionally, any failure to meet required payments of principal and interest under our outstanding indebtedness could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other indebtedness that contains cross-default provisions.\n\u2022Growth: Our plans for growth have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by COVID-19. This environment has and could continue to result in difficulties for our franchisees and property owners to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, our development pipeline is subject to a number of risks, including that developers are experiencing construction delays as a result of restrictions on business activity and supply chain interruptions which could cause delays in the completion and development of new hotels, impacting our net rooms growth and/or slowing the rate of our pipeline growth.\n\u2022Capital Markets Impact: The global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility as a result of COVID-19. The price of our common stock has been volatile and has experienced periods of significant declines since the onset of the pandemic. The significant uncertainty created by the impact of COVID-19 has caused the global economy, business confidence and consumer confidence to have, and likely continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including on our common stock. In addition, we are restricted in our ability to repurchase shares and limited in our ability to make dividend payments.\nSee \u201cItem 2. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a description of the mitigating actions we have taken and our liquidity and indebtedness.\nDespite the steps we have taken to assess and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business operations, financial results, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity, as well as the impact on our franchisees and property owners and their operations, our guests and our team members, the hospitality industry and overall demand for travel will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, among other things:\n\u2022the scope and duration of the pandemic, including any additional resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases or increased rates of infectiousness or severity related to mutations or variants of COVID-19 and the timing and availability of vaccinations and other treatments for COVID-19;\n\u2022actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic, including stay-in-place directives and other travel restrictions and the success of those actions;\n\u2022the continued or enhanced need for, and success of, mitigation efforts, containment measures and other responses by our franchisees, property owners, and us;\n\u2022the potential of our franchisees and property owners to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate debt or foreclose on the property, which could result in the termination of our franchise or management agreements;\n\u2022actual or perceived risks of contracting COVID-19 and new information which may emerge concerning its severity and impact;\n\u2022the negative impact of COVID-19 on global and regional economies and economic activity generally, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer confidence, discretionary spending and pricing;\n\u2022our relationships with franchisees and property owners;\n\u2022our liquidity based on our access to capital and financing as a result of COVID-19 and the terms and cost thereof, as well as our credit rating;\n\u2022potential risk of additional impairments to certain intangible assets, such as our trademarks and our franchised and managed goodwill;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls as many team members continue to work remotely;\n\u2022cybersecurity risks and risks related to unauthorized access to confidential information as employees continue to work remotely;\n\u2022potential exposure to make payments to third-parties to whom we made financial guarantees;\n\u2022the impact on our contracts with our partners, including force majeure provisions;\n\u2022labor markets and activities or additional demands or requests from labor unions or labor disputes or disruptions or the impact from position eliminations, furloughs or other actions;\n\u2022unexpected additional costs and expenses incurred by us, franchisees and property owners related to the effects of COVID-19 and steps taken to counteract future outbreaks, including enhanced health and hygiene or social distancing requirements;\n\u2022the effects of any steps we take to reduce operating costs as a result of COVID-19, including with respect to our brand reputation, our ability to operate the company, our ability to attract and retain team members and guest experience and loyalty;\n\u2022the potential exposure related to guests or team members who may contract COVID-19; and\n\u2022the potential diversion of management\u2019s attention from the business due to COVID-19, including if any key team member becomes ill from COVID-19 or unable to work.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 cannot be predicted in terms of type, duration or impact and could intensify or otherwise affect many of the other risks set forth in this Item 1A of our Annual Report or present other unforeseen consequences for the business.\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive, and we are subject to risks related to competition that may adversely affect our performance and growth.\nOur continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of whom may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. We compete with other hotel franchisors for franchisees and we may not be able to grow our franchise system. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for lodging. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees, and may require us to offer terms to prospective franchisees less favorable to us than current franchise agreements, which may adversely impact our profits. Our franchisees also compete with alternative lodging channels, including third-party providers of short-term rental properties and serviced apartments. Increasing use of these alternative lodging channels could adversely affect the occupancy and/or average rates at franchised hotels and our revenues. The use of business models by competitors that are different from ours may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel and hotel industries may adversely affect us.\nWe face risks affecting the travel and hotel industries that include: economic slowdown and recession; economic factors such as increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income adversely impacting decisions by consumers and\nbusinesses to use travel accommodations; domestic unrest, terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; political instability or political and regional strife; acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, volcanoes and other natural disasters; war; concerns with or threats of pandemics, contagious diseases or health epidemics, such as COVID-19; environmental disasters; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes; and increases in gasoline and other fuel prices. Any such decline in or disruptions to the travel or hotel industries may adversely affect our franchised hotels, the operations of current and potential franchisees, developers and hotel owners with which we have hotel management contracts.\nThird-party Internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks.\nConsumers increasingly use third-party Internet travel intermediaries, including search engines, and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their lodging accommodations. As the percentage of internet reservations increases, travel intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions and reduced room rates to the detriment of our business. Additionally, such travel intermediaries may divert reservations away from our direct online channels or increase the overall cost of Internet reservations for our affiliated hotels through their fees and a variety of online marketing methods, including the purchase by certain travel intermediaries of keywords consisting of or containing our hotel brands from Internet search engines to influence search results and direct guests to their websites. If we fail to reach satisfactory agreements with intermediaries, our affiliated hotels may not appear on their websites and we could lose business as a result. Further, travel intermediaries may seek to offer distribution services under their own brands directly to lodging accommodations in competition with our core franchise business.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Acquisitions\nWe are subject to business, financial, operating and other risks common to the hotel, hotel franchising and hotel management industries which also affect our franchisees and hotel owners, any of which could reduce our revenues, limit our growth or otherwise impact our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from fees based on room revenues at hotels franchised under our brands. As such, our business is subject, directly or through our franchisees, to risks common in the hotel, hotel franchising and hotel management industries, including risks related to:\n\u2022our ability to meet our objectives for growth in the number of our franchised hotels, hotel rooms in our franchise system and hotels under management and to retain and renew franchisee and hotel management contracts, all on favorable terms;\n\u2022the number, occupancy and room rates of hotels operating under our franchise and management agreements;\n\u2022the delay of hotel openings in our pipeline;\n\u2022changes in the supply and demand for hotel rooms;\n\u2022our ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with current and potential franchisees and hotel owners under our hotel management agreements and other third parties, including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels;\n\u2022our franchisees' pricing decisions;\n\u2022the quality of the services provided by franchisees and their investments in the maintenance and improvement of properties;\n\u2022the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant number of our franchised or managed hotels;\n\u2022the financial condition of franchisees, owners or other developers and the availability of financing to them;\n\u2022adverse events occurring at franchised or managed hotel locations, including personal injuries, food tampering, contamination or the spread of illness, including COVID-19;\n\u2022negative publicity, which could damage our hotel brands;\n\u2022our ability to successfully market our current or any future hotel brands and programs, including our rewards program, and to service or pilot new initiatives;\n\u2022our management contract or relationship with CorePoint Lodging, Inc. (\u201cCorePoint\u201d), which in aggregate owns approximately 70% of our managed hotels and any decision by CorePoint to divest additional hotels;\n\u2022changes in the laws, regulations and legislation affecting our business, internationally and domestically;\n\u2022our failure to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the relative mix of branded hotels in the various hotel industry price categories;\n\u2022corporate budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business;\n\u2022seasonal or cyclical volatility in our business;\n\u2022operating costs, including as a result of inflation, energy costs and labor costs, such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care related costs and insurance; and\n\u2022disputes, claims and litigation and other legal proceedings concerning our or our franchised or managed hotels\u2019 operations, including with consumers, government regulators, other businesses, franchisees and hotel owners, organized labor activities and class actions.\nAny of these factors could reduce our revenues, increase our costs or otherwise limit our opportunities for growth.\nOur international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to numerous risks including: exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; hostility from local populations; political instability, including potential disruptions from the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, trade disputes with trade partners, including China and other geopolitical risks; threats or acts of terrorism; the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease, such as COVID-19 or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by foreigners; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; forced nationalization of hotel properties by local, state or national governments; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws, including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies and the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any member of our senior management could harm our business.\nWe believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued services of our senior management team. Losing the services of any members of our senior management team, including due to COVID-19 or the increased availability of permanent remote positions, could adversely affect our strategic relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. The market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and finding and recruiting suitable replacements for senior management may be difficult, time-consuming and costly.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties and failure to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of hotel brands, businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we may otherwise have paid absent such competition. We may not be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms and any such strategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, may not be successful.\nRisks Relating to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nOur revenues could be impacted if we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with CorePoint.\nIn connection with the La Quinta acquisition, we entered into hotel-management agreements and hotel franchise agreements with CorePoint. We are also subject to certain agreements related to CorePoint\u2019s previously completed spin-off of its real estate business. In October 2019, we entered into an additional agreement with CorePoint to collaborate on a number of new technology and operating initiatives, support CorePoint\u2019s efforts to enhance its portfolio and resolve open issues between CorePoint and us. If these agreements are prematurely terminated due to one party's uncured default of their obligations or the parties' mutual agreement or these agreements are not renewed following their expiration, our profitability and revenues could decrease and our growth potential may be adversely affected.\nOur license and other fees could be impacted by any softness in Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sales of vacation ownership interests or decline in the volume of affinity leads which we generate for Wyndham Destinations.\nIn connection with the spin-off, we entered into a number of agreements with Wyndham Destinations that govern our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations. Our success depends, in part, on the maintenance of our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Destinations, Wyndham Destinations\u2019 performance of its obligations under these agreements, including Wyndham Destinations\u2019 maintenance of the quality of products and services it sells under the \u201cWyndham\u201d trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property that we license to Wyndham Destinations. Under the license, development and noncompetition agreement, Wyndham Destinations pays us significant royalties and other fees based on the volume of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sales of vacation ownership interests and other vacation products and services. If Wyndham Destinations is unable to compete effectively for sales of vacation ownership interests or COVID-19 continues to negatively impact such sales, our royalty fees under such agreement could be adversely impacted. If we are unable to\nmaintain a good relationship with Wyndham Destinations, or if Wyndham Destinations does not perform its obligations under these agreements, fails to maintain the quality of the products and services it sells under the \u201cWyndham\u201d trademark and certain other trademarks or fails to pay such royalties, our earnings could decrease.\nRisks Relating to Regulation and Technology\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with regulations may adversely affect us.\nOur operations are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, U.S. and international federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our profits or require us to modify our business practices substantially. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, those governing franchising, hotel operations, lending, information security, data protection and privacy (such as the General Data Protection Regulation or similar laws or regulations), credit card security standards, marketing, including sales, consumer protection and advertising, unfair and deceptive trade practices, fraud, bribery and corruption, licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental, intellectual property, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Sherman Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution. Changes to such laws and regulations and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and proprietary information, non-compliance with our contractual obligations regarding such information or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we and our service providers collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to guests, franchisees, stockholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of guest credit and payment card information. We are at risk of attack by cyber-criminals operating on a global basis attempting to gain access to such information. In connection with data security incidents involving a group of Wyndham brand hotels that occurred between 2008 and 2010, one of our subsidiaries is subject to a stipulated order with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, it must meet certain requirements for reasonable data security as outlined in the stipulated order.\nWhile we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over personal and proprietary information, a breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of personal or proprietary information could nevertheless occur or our subsidiary could fail to comply with the stipulated order with the FTC. As a result of COVID-19, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. Violation or non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or with our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our hotel brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers such as Sabre Corporation and its SynXis Platform and uninterrupted operations of our and third party service facilities, including those used for reservation systems, hotel/property management, communications, procurement, call centers, operation of our loyalty program and administrative systems. We and our vendors also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. As a result, in addition to failures that occur from time to time in the ordinary course, we and our vendors may be vulnerable to system failures, computer hacking, cyber-terrorism, computer viruses and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the potential risk of security breaches or breakdown. Any natural disaster, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our vendors could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Tax Treatment\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and cash flows could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nWe are subject to risks related to our debt, hedging transactions, our extension of credit and the cost and availability of capital.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had aggregate outstanding debt of $2,597 million. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may magnify the potential impacts of the risks related to our debt. Our debt instruments contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, could limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions; take advantage of business opportunities; incur or guarantee additional debt; pay dividends or make distributions; make investments or acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets; create liens; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with affiliates; and prepay and repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness. Failure to meet our payment obligations or comply with other financial covenants could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions. As disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in April 2020, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, suspend the quarterly testing of the leverage-based financial covenant until April 1, 2021. Following the relief period under the first amendment, the first amendment re-establishes the financial covenant, subject to an annualization mechanic described therein.\nIn order to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations, we may use financial instruments, such as hedging transactions. Changes in interest rates may adversely affect our financing costs and/or change the market value of our hedging transactions. Any failure or non-performance of counterparties under our hedging transactions could result in losses.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is expected to no longer be available after June 30, 2023 for the primary U.S. dollar LIBOR settings used by the Company. As a result, there have been significant efforts by market participants and government and regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad to identify suitable replacement rates and develop processes for migration to the use of the alternatives. Our credit facility gives us the option to use LIBOR as a funding benchmark and our interest rate swaps are based on the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR. Our credit facility allows us and the administrative agent to replace LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate, subject to the right of the majority of the lenders to object thereto, as set forth in the credit facility. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has issued terms that can be applied to determine the alternative reference rates under swap transactions and the timing of the switch to such alternatives. Any discontinuation of LIBOR and use of an alternative benchmark rate under our credit facility or our interest rate swap transactions is expected to be accompanied by a spread adjustment. The implementation of such alternative reference rates and spread adjustments could cause our funding costs to increase, including if there arises a differential between the alternative reference rate and/or spread adjustment under our credit facility and the alternative reference rate and/or spread adjustment applicable to our interest rate hedges.\nIn addition, we extend credit to assist franchisees and hotel owners in converting to, or building a new hotel under, one of our hotel brands through development advance notes and mezzanine or other forms of subordinated financing. The inability of franchisees and hotel owners to pay back such loans, including as a result of the ongoing effects of COVID-19, could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and business.\nWe may need to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or general corporate or other purposes may be limited, and we may be unable to renew or refinance our debt on terms as favorable as our existing debt or at all. Additionally, certain market liquidity factors, including uncertainty or volatility in the equity and credit markets, outside of our control could affect our access to credit and capital in the future and adversely impact our business plans and operating model. Our credit rating and the market value of our common stock could also be affected. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to refinance or repay our outstanding debt when due, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur additional impairment losses and require us to write-off all or a portion of the remaining value of our goodwill or other intangibles of companies we have acquired.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We may be required to record additional significant non-cash impairment charges in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets is determined, which would negatively impact our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nRisks Relating to Litigation, Reputation and Insurance\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a number of disputes, claims, litigation and other legal proceedings as described in this report, and any unfavorable rulings or outcomes in current or future litigation and other legal proceedings may materially harm our business. For additional information, see our Commitments and Contingencies note (Note 14) in the notes to our financial statements.\nWe are subject to risks related to human trafficking allegations.\nOur business, along with the hospitality industry generally, faces risk that could cause damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands due to claims related to purported incidents of human trafficking. Along with many of our competitors, we and/or certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in litigation matters filed in state and federal courts (and incurred litigation-related fees and costs), alleging statutory and common law claims arising from purported incidents of human trafficking perpetrated by third parties at certain franchised and managed hotel facilities. For additional information, see our Commitments and Contingencies note (Note 14) in the notes to our financial statements.\nThe insurance we carry may not always pay, or be sufficient to pay or reimburse us, for our liabilities, losses or replacement costs.\nWe carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption and other insurable risks with respect to our business and franchised, managed and owned hotels. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The insurance coverage we carry, subject to our deductible, may not be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance in the full amount, or any amount, or at all concerning a potential loss or liability, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business that are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Corporate Governance\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate.\nThe market price for our common stock, and the market price of stock of other companies operating in the hospitality industry, has been highly volatile. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the trading price of our common stock ranged between a low sales price of $21.59 and a high sales price of $62.57. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including the effects of ongoing COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance, our ability to achieve growth and performance objectives, the success or failure of our business strategy, general economic conditions, our quarterly or annual earnings and those of other companies in our industry, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, changes in laws and regulations, political instability, increased competition and changes affecting the travel industry and other events impacting our business. The stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain of our Directors and executive officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their ownership of Wyndham Destinations equity or their current or former positions at Wyndham Destinations.\nTwo of our Directors also serve on the Wyndham Destinations Board and certain of our executive officers and non-employee Directors own shares of Wyndham Destinations common stock because of their current or former positions with Wyndham Destinations. This could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Wyndham Destinations\u2019 management, officers and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Wyndham Destinations.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nOur business, along with the hospitality industry generally, faces scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and the risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our hotel brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, responsible tourism, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, philanthropy and support for local communities.\nProvisions in our corporate governance documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our business, which could decrease the market price of our common stock.\nOur corporate governance documents and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter or delay coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids, including requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals, placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings, authorizing our Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, and providing for the classification of our Board until the third annual meeting of stockholders following the spin-off, which we expect to be held in 2021. Additionally, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may prevent or delay an acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial, which could decrease the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated by-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our Directors or employees.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative actions; claims related to a breach of a fiduciary duty, corporate law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or under the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our Directors or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated by-laws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and Board.\nWe may not continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and the current terms of our indebtedness limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and we are currently restricted from repurchasing shares of our common stock.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions under our indebtedness and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Though we expect to make regular dividends, there can be no assurance that a payment of a dividend will occur in the future.\nAs a result of the financial impact of COVID-19, our Board approved a reduction in the quarterly cash dividend policy from $0.32 per share to $0.08 per share, beginning with the dividend that was declared by the Board during the second quarter of 2020. On February 10, 2021, we announced the Board's approval of an increase in the quarterly cash dividend policy to $0.16 per share. Additionally, as a condition of the first amendment to our credit agreement, we are constrained to $0.16 per share for dividend payments and may be restricted in future quarterly dividend payments to $0.01 per share in the event that our liquidity is below $300 million. Furthermore, on March 17, 2020, we suspended our share repurchase activity and, as a condition of the first amendment to our credit agreement, we are restricted from repurchasing shares of our common stock. These restrictions will be lifted following the relief period under the first amendment.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nWe have a limited operating history as a separate public company and our financial information from before the spin-off from Wyndham Destinations may not reflect our current or future results as an independent company.\nPrior to the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations performed various corporate functions for us, including tax administration, governance, compliance, accounting, internal audit and external reporting. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Wyndham Destinations for these and similar functions that may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company.\nIn connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rentals business, we agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Destinations agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and if we are required to perform under these indemnities or if Wyndham Destinations is unable to satisfy its obligations under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nThe contingent liabilities we assumed in connection with the spin-off and Wyndham Destinations\u2019 sale of its European vacation rentals business could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In connection with the spin-off, Wyndham Destinations agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Wyndham Destinations for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 business with Wyndham Destinations. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the \u201cSDA\u201d), we assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Wyndham Destinations, which we refer to in this Report as \u201cshared contingent liabilities,\u201d incurred prior to the spin-off, including liabilities of Wyndham Destinations related to, arising out of or resulting from certain terminated or divested businesses, certain general corporate and tax matters of Wyndham Destinations and any actions with respect to the spin-off brought by any third party.\nAdditionally, in connection with the sale of Wyndham Destinations\u2019 European vacation rentals business, we provided certain post-closing credit support in the form of guarantees, which as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $127 million, to ensure that the business meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities. Such post-closing credit support may be enforced or called upon if the European vacation rentals business fails to meet its primary obligation to pay certain amounts when due. The European vacation rentals business has provided an indemnity to Wyndham Destinations in the event that the post-closing credit support is enforced or called upon. Pursuant to the terms of the SDA, we assumed one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumed two-thirds of any such losses actually incurred by Wyndham Destinations or us in the event that these credit support arrangements are enforced or called upon by any beneficiary and any amounts paid by Wyndham Destinations or us in respect of any indemnification claims made in connection with the sale of the European vacation rentals business.\nShould our indemnification obligations exceed applicable insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the indemnities from Wyndham Destinations may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Wyndham Destinations has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Wyndham Destinations any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nAlthough we received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that we and Wyndham Destinations were adequately capitalized immediately after the spin-off, the spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that Wyndham Destinations did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Wyndham Destinations insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Wyndham Destinations intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer, it could impose a number of different remedies, including, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Wyndham Destinations or providing Wyndham Destinations with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Wyndham Destinations and the fair market value of our Company at the time of the spin-off.\nIf the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our stockholders, we and Wyndham Destinations might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nThe spin-off was conditioned upon Wyndham Destinations\u2019 receipt of opinions of its spin-off tax advisors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described in the opinions, the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, would qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), in which no gain or loss would be recognized by Wyndham Destinations or its stockholders, except, in the case of Wyndham Destinations stockholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, which opinions were delivered on the closing date of the spin-off. The opinions of the spin-off tax advisors are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the spin-off and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIn addition, Wyndham Destinations received certain rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of transactions related to the spin-off. Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the continuing accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Wyndham Destinations.\nIf the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant with respect to such tax opinions or the IRS Ruling, Wyndham Destinations would recognize a substantial gain attributable to our hotel business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Wyndham Destinations consolidated group at the time of the spin-off, including us and certain of our subsidiaries, would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability.", "PERMNO": 17794, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "WH"}
