{"cik": "1620546", "company": "Baxalta Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cRisks Related to Baxalta\u2019s Business - If Baxalta is unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if it experiences other manufacturing or supply difficulties, its business may be adversely affected.\u201d\nCompetition and Healthcare Cost Containment\nBaxalta enjoys leading positions based on a number of competitive advantages. The Baxalta business benefits from continued innovation in its products and therapies, consistency of its supply of products, strong customer relationships and the technological advantages of its products.\nBaxalta faces substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies of all sizes, in the United States and internationally, and such competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience and technological innovation. There has been increasing consolidation in the company\u2019s customer base, which continues to result in pricing and market pressures.\nThe principal sources of competition for Baxalta\u2019s principal products globally are as follows:\n\u2022\nADVATE: Xyntha\u00ae/ReFacto AF\u00ae (Pfizer and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum); Kogenate\u00ae (Bayer); Helixate\u00ae (CSL Behring); Eloctate\u00ae (Biogen Idec); NovoEight\u00ae (Novo Nordisk); and Nuwiq\u00ae (Octapharma).\n\u2022\nFEIBA: NovoSeven\u00ae/NovoSeven RT\u00ae (Novo Nordisk); Coagil VII\u00ae (Pharmstandard); and Facteur VII-LFB\u00ae (LFB Group).\n\u2022\nGAMMAGARD LIQUID: Privigen\u00ae/Hizentra\u00ae/Carimune NF\u00ae (CSL Behring); Flebogamma DIF\u00ae/Gamunex-C\u00ae (Grifols); Octagam\u00ae/Octagam 10\u00ae/Gammanorm\u00ae (Octapharma); Ig Vena\u00ae/Gammaked\u00ae (Kedrion); and Intratect 10%\u00ae/Intratect, Intraglobin F\u00ae/Bivigam\u00ae (Biotest).\nAdditionally, for each of the principal products listed above, there are additional competitive products or alternative therapy regimens available on a more limited geographic basis throughout the world.\nIn March 2010, the PPACA was enacted in the United States, and implemented a number of changes in how companies are compensated for providing healthcare products and services. The PPACA includes several provisions which impact the company\u2019s businesses in the United States, including a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government, increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices.\nFor additional information regarding competition and healthcare cost containment, refer to the discussion of such matters in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the following:\n\u2022\n\u201cRisks Related to Baxalta\u2019s Business - Baxalta\u2019s products face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u201cRisks Related to Baxalta\u2019s Business - If reimbursement or other payment for Baxalta\u2019s current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through the implementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then Baxalta\u2019s business could suffer.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u201cRisks Related to Baxalta\u2019s Business - Baxalta faces competition in the development of relationships with research, academic and governmental institutions.\u201d\nEmployees\nBaxalta employed approximately 17,000 persons as of December 31, 2015. Outside of the United States, some of Baxalta\u2019s employees are represented by unions or works councils. Baxalta believes that it has good relations with its employees and their unions and works councils.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental policies of the company require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection.\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations\nIn July 2014, the company entered into an agreement to sell its commercial vaccines business and committed to a plan to divest the remainder of its vaccines business, which included certain R&D programs. In December 2014, the company completed the sale of the commercial vaccines business and in August 2015, completed the divestiture of certain vaccines-related R&D programs. As a result of the divestitures, the operations and cash flows of the vaccines business have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company. In addition, the company will not have significant continuing involvement or cash flows from the operations associated with the vaccines business.\nAvailable Information\nBaxalta makes available free of charge on its website at www.baxalta.com its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such material to the SEC.

The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains our reports, proxy and information statements, and other information at www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating Baxalta and Baxalta\u2019s common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. The risk factors generally have been separated into four groups: risks related to Baxalta\u2019s business, risks related to the separation and distribution, risks related to Baxalta\u2019s common stock and risks related to the proposed Merger with Shire.\nRisks Related to Baxalta\u2019s Business\nIf Baxalta is unable to successfully introduce new products, encounters negative developments with respect to its existing products or fails to keep pace with advances in technology, Baxalta\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBaxalta currently relies on the revenues generated from its principal products, including ADVATE, FEIBA and GAMMAGARD LIQUID. Although Baxalta has developed and continues to develop additional products for commercial introduction, the company may be substantially dependent on sales from these products for many years. Any negative developments relating to any of these products, such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, constraints on product pricing or price increases, changes in reimbursement policies of third parties or adverse regulatory or legislative developments, may reduce Baxalta\u2019s revenues and adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations.\nBaxalta needs to successfully introduce new products to achieve its strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment, and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including Baxalta\u2019s ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate Baxalta\u2019s products from those of its competitors. If Baxalta cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, the company\u2019s products may become obsolete and its revenue and profitability could suffer.\nIn November 2015, Baxalta received regulatory approval for ADYNOVATE in the United States. ADYNOVATE is an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. While ADVATE is expected to continue to be an important revenue-driver for the company, ADYNOVATE is an alternative for patients preferring an extended half-life treatment, which allows for fewer doses and may be preferable in terms of convenience to some patients. If the company does not receive regulatory approvals for the commercialization of ADYNOVATE outside of the United States, or if the company is unable to successfully execute on its plans to commercialize ADYNOVATE, Baxalta\u2019s future revenue growth and results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that extended half-life and similar products otherwise adversely affect ADVATE results. Along with the risk that additional regulatory approvals may not be received, factors that may prevent the company from successfully meeting its plans for the launch and commercialization of ADYNOVATE include the availability of competitive products; any reputational damage that may result from adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with ADYNOVATE; any successful challenge with respect to rights in the company\u2019s exclusive ownership of the PEGylation technology utilized in ADYNOVATE; and other risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d related to the operation of the company\u2019s business and the sales of products of the business.\nBaxalta\u2019s pipeline also includes additional extended half-life therapies for hemophilia A and other potential new treatments for hemophilia A and B (including gene therapy) and a recombinant treatment for patients with inhibitors, as well as treatments in other areas of unmet medical need (including oncology), each of which remains subject to additional clinical development risks in addition to the factors listed above. For a discussion of Baxalta\u2019s R&D activities and product pipeline, refer to the discussion in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cExecutive Summary - Research and Development and External Innovation\u201d and Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cBuilding a Diversified Biopharmaceutical Pipeline.\u201d\nIssues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon Baxalta\u2019s business, subject Baxalta to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta or its products.\nBaxalta\u2019s success depends upon the quality of its products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the company\u2019s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of Baxalta\u2019s products. Baxalta\u2019s future success depends on its ability to maintain and continuously improve its quality management program. While Baxalta has one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of its products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of these products at any stage. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta or its current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxalta has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.\nUnaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to Baxalta\u2019s R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with Baxalta\u2019s quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact Baxalta\u2019s business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in Baxalta\u2019s production processes are derived from human and animal origins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants.\nBaxalta is subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, and Baxalta is susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, Baxalta\u2019s operations and products, and those of its customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on Baxalta is direct to the extent the company is subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though the company may not be directly regulated by specific biopharmaceutical laws and regulations, Baxalta\u2019s products must be capable of being used by its customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.\nThe manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of Baxalta\u2019s products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities globally. In particular, regulation of the development, manufacture, and sale of biologics (including biosimilars) may be more complex and require greater expenditures than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Baxalta\u2019s facilities must be licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in Baxalta\u2019s adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in Baxalta and its products, which could adversely affect the company\u2019s sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase Baxalta\u2019s costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting Baxalta, refer to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cRegulation.\u201d In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company\u2019s operations and consolidated and combined financial statements.\nThe sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that biopharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including the parts that relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of biopharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of biopharmaceutical companies\u2019 sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of Baxalta\u2019s products and those governing Baxalta\u2019s relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the PPACA, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Baxalta has compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed\nto address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect the company from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on Baxalta\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to Baxalta\u2019s ethics and compliance programs, refer to the discussion in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cEthics and Compliance.\u201d For more information related to Baxalta\u2019s legal proceedings, see Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Baxalta to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of the company\u2019s sales and marketing practices and may subject the company to enforcement actions which could adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBaxalta\u2019s products face substantial competition in the product markets in which it operates.\nBaxalta faces substantial competition throughout its business from international and domestic biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience, and technological innovation.\nCompetition may increase further as existing competitors enhance their offerings or additional companies enter Baxalta\u2019s markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with Baxalta\u2019s products. If Baxalta\u2019s competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, the company\u2019s products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If Baxalta\u2019s competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than the company does, its operations will likely be negatively affected. If Baxalta is forced to reduce its prices due to increased competition, Baxalta\u2019s business could become less profitable. The company\u2019s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with customers (including with hospitals, treatment centers and other health care providers, distributors, group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks) are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.\nIf Baxalta\u2019s business development activities are unsuccessful, Baxalta\u2019s business could suffer and Baxalta\u2019s financial performance could be adversely affected.\nAs part of Baxalta\u2019s long-term strategy, Baxalta is engaged in business development activities including evaluating and consummating acquisitions, joint research and development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the company\u2019s resources. Baxalta\u2019s success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including Baxalta\u2019s ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether Baxalta is able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to the company; the strength of the other company\u2019s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and Baxalta\u2019s ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into Baxalta\u2019s existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact Baxalta\u2019s ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If Baxalta is unsuccessful in its business development activities, the company may be unable to meet its financial targets and Baxalta\u2019s financial performance could be adversely affected.\nFor more information on recent business development activities, refer to the discussion in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cExecutive Summary - Research and Development and\nExternal Innovation\u201d and Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the captions entitled \u201cResearch and Development Activities\u201d and \u201cCollaborations.\u201d\nBaxalta\u2019s growth strategy depends upon its ability to expand its product portfolio through external collaborations, which, if unsuccessful, may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.\nBaxalta intends to continue to explore opportunities to enter into collaboration agreements and external alliances with other parties, focusing on hematology, oncology and immunology. These third party collaborators may include other biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions, governments and government agencies and other public and private research organizations.\nThese third party collaborators are often directly responsible for clinical development under these types of arrangements, and Baxalta does not have the same level of decision-making capabilities for the prioritization and management of development-related activities as it does for its internal research and development activities. Failures by these partners to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to Baxalta, or any disruption in the relationships between Baxalta and these partners, could have a material adverse effect on Baxalta\u2019s pipeline and business. In addition, Baxalta\u2019s collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of Baxalta and its partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. These could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or other intellectual property protections, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration.\nLong-term public-private partnerships with governments and government agencies, including in certain emerging markets, may include technology transfers to support local manufacturing capacity and technical expertise. Baxalta cannot predict whether these types of transfers and arrangements will become more common in the future. These types of technology transfers and similar arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations as a result of lost exclusivity with respect to certain manufacturing and technical capabilities, particularly if this model becomes widely used. Public-private partnerships are also subject to risks of doing business with governments and government agencies, including risks related to sovereign immunity, shifts in the political environment, changing economic and legal conditions and social dynamics.\nFor more information on Baxalta\u2019s current pipeline, refer to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cBuilding a Diversified Biopharmaceutical Pipeline.\u201d\nIf reimbursement or other payment for Baxalta\u2019s current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through the implementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then Baxalta\u2019s business could suffer.\nSales of Baxalta\u2019s products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of its products are paid by both public and private payors. These payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Baxalta may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operational results.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of Baxalta\u2019s products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payors. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for\nexample, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for Baxalta\u2019s products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for its products.\nFor example, in the United States the PPACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions that impact Baxalta\u2019s businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. Baxalta may also experience downward pricing pressure as the PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the PPACA on Baxalta\u2019s business and the demand for the company\u2019s products is uncertain.\nAs a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow Baxalta to sell its products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for Baxalta\u2019s products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to Baxalta. Baxalta cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect the company\u2019s business.\nThe nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent Baxalta from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing its production capacity.\nThe production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process, and Baxalta sources its plasma both externally and internally through BioLife Plasma Services L.P. (BioLife), its wholly owned subsidiary. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-based therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and plasma fractionation facilities. Baxalta is in the process of building a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Covington, Georgia to support growth of its plasma-based treatments, with commercial production scheduled to begin in 2018. The development of such facilities involves a lengthy regulatory process and is highly capital intensive. In addition, access to and transport and use of plasma may be subject to restrictions by governmental agencies both inside and outside the United States. As a result, Baxalta\u2019s ability to match its collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand for its plasma-based therapies or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for Baxalta\u2019s plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply, Baxalta may be forced to lower the prices it charges for some of its plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Baxalta is unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if it experiences other manufacturing or supply difficulties, its business may be adversely affected.\nThe manufacture of Baxalta\u2019s products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality materials. Baxalta manufactures its products in more than ten manufacturing facilities around the world. Baxalta acquires its materials from many suppliers in various countries and works closely with its suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply, but cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify its sources of components and materials, in certain instances Baxalta acquires components and materials from a sole supplier. For most of its components and materials for which a sole supplier is used, Baxalta believes that alternative sources of supply exist and has made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier. In very limited instances, however, including with respect to a single material used in ADVATE, ADYNOVATE and HYQVIA, Baxalta relies on sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have\ncurrently been identified. Although Baxalta does carry strategic inventory and maintains insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Due to the regulatory environment in which it operates, Baxalta may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s ability to manufacture its products in a timely or cost-effective manner or to make product sales.\nMany of Baxalta\u2019s products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, particularly biologics, as well as the strict regulatory regimes governing the company\u2019s manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to the company\u2019s reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to the company\u2019s customers may also result in quality or safety issues, which could result in significant recalls, remediations or other costs.\nSeveral of Baxalta\u2019s products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect the company\u2019s ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to obtain regulatory approval and licensing of a manufacturing facility, a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event the company loses manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise not available due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.\nIf Baxalta is unable to protect its patents or other proprietary rights, or if Baxalta infringes the patents or other proprietary rights of others, its competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nPatent and other proprietary rights are essential to Baxalta\u2019s business. Baxalta\u2019s success depends to a significant degree on its ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. Baxalta cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that the patents and other intellectual property rights of Baxalta and its business partners will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling its products or from executing on its strategies.\nThe patent position of a biopharmaceutical company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in Baxalta\u2019s industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of Baxalta\u2019s patents on products or processes as well as allegations that Baxalta\u2019s products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. Baxalta also relies on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen Baxalta\u2019s competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to Baxalta\u2019s trade secrets or disclose Baxalta\u2019s trade secrets to the public.\nAlthough Baxalta employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect the company\u2019s confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and the company may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, Baxalta\u2019s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that Baxalta\u2019s employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nFurthermore, Baxalta\u2019s intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While the company has invested to protect its intellectual property and other data, and continues to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that its precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMisappropriation or other loss of Baxalta\u2019s intellectual property from any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s competitive position and may cause it to incur substantial litigation costs.\nBaxalta faces competition in the development of relationships with research, academic and governmental institutions.\nBaxalta faces competition for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to Baxalta\u2019s products. These companies and institutions compete with Baxalta in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to Baxalta\u2019s programs. If Baxalta is unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, its business may suffer.\nBaxalta is subject to risks associated with doing business globally.\nBaxalta\u2019s operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws (including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act), dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection, shifts in the political environment or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect Baxalta\u2019s global operations could have a material adverse effect on Baxalta\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Baxalta\u2019s operating results and liquidity.\nBaxalta generates a substantial portion of its revenue (approximately 45% of its total revenue in 2015) outside the United States. As a result, Baxalta\u2019s financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Baxalta cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the ability of the company to mitigate these risks. Baxalta may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. Baxalta is also exposed to changes in interest rates, and the company\u2019s ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur. For discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which Baxalta attempts to mitigate such impact, refer to Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on Baxalta\u2019s operating results.\nTax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have a material adverse effect upon Baxalta\u2019s results of operations. Because Baxalta operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, it is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions the company has taken and assess additional taxes and related penalties. The company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its tax provision. However, the company may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s financial results. For more information on the company\u2019s income taxes, refer to Note 14 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBaxalta is increasingly dependent on information technology systems, and the company\u2019s systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.\nBaxalta relies upon its technology systems and infrastructure. Baxalta\u2019s technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to Baxalta\u2019s systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in the company\u2019s systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. The company could also experience a business interruption, information theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise the company\u2019s system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at the company\u2019s third-party providers or other business partners. While Baxalta has invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in the company\u2019s systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as Baxalta seeks to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.\nIf Baxalta fails to attract and retain key employees Baxalta\u2019s business may suffer.\nBaxalta\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, research and sales and marketing. Competition for top talent in the biopharmaceuticals business can be intense. Baxalta\u2019s ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of Baxalta\u2019s competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. The announcement of the Merger may also adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s ability to attract and retain employees. If Baxalta cannot effectively hire and retain qualified employees, its business could suffer.\nBaxalta is subject to pending lawsuits.\nBaxalta is a defendant in certain pending lawsuits and may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits, including lawsuits that may relate to its business prior to the separation. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion of Baxalta\u2019s management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, Baxalta is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject Baxalta to adverse publicity and require Baxalta to incur significant legal fees. For more information regarding legal proceedings involving Baxalta, refer to Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCurrent or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s business and financial condition.\nBaxalta\u2019s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company\u2019s products, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the company\u2019s key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of Baxalta\u2019s customers (including governments) to pay for its products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for Baxalta\u2019s products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of Baxalta\u2019s suppliers, which could cause a disruption in Baxalta\u2019s ability to produce its products. In addition, global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. In particular, Baxalta has significant accounts receivable related to its Hemobr\u00e1s partnership in Brazil ($207 million at December 31, 2015). These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro or other currencies in which Baxalta does business.\nAlthough biosimilars represent a developing opportunity for Baxalta, the market has an uncertain regulatory framework, and Baxalta and its partners may not be able to successfully develop and introduce biosimilar products.\nBaxalta is actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products, including with its partners. Significant uncertainty remains concerning both the regulatory pathway in the United States and in other countries to obtain approval of biosimilar products and the commercial pathway to successfully market and sell such products. The BPCIA authorizes FDA to approve biosimilars through a more abbreviated pathway as compared to new biologics. Although in March 2015 FDA approved the first biosimilar drug in the United States, and recently approved a second biosimilar drug the approval pathway for biosimilar applications remains relatively untested and is subject to ongoing guidance from FDA. Delays and uncertainties in these approval pathways may result in delays or difficulties in the approval of Baxalta\u2019s biosimilar products by regulatory authorities, subject Baxalta to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments Baxalta has made in biosimilars. Any such delays, difficulties or unanticipated costs could impact the profitability of the company\u2019s biosimilars products.\nEven if Baxalta and its partners are able to obtain approvals from FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities, the company\u2019s biosimilar products and partnerships may not be commercially successful and may not generate profits in amounts that are sufficient to offset the amount invested to develop such biosimilars and obtain such approvals. Biosimilar products could be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product for many years. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to patients, physicians and payors (such as insurance companies) that such products are safe and effective compared to other existing products and offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies. If Baxalta\u2019s competitors develop biosimilar products more quickly or more efficiently than Baxalta does, Baxalta may not be able to effectively execute on its biosimilar strategy. Depending on the outcome of these risks, Baxalta\u2019s sales of biosimilar products and related profitability may not meet the company\u2019s expectations, and the company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFor more information on biosimilars, refer to the discussion in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the captions entitled \u201cIntellectual Property\u201d and \u201cRegulation.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Separation and Distribution\nBaxalta has only operated as an independent company since July 1, 2015, and Baxalta\u2019s historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.\nThe historical information about Baxalta prior to July 1, 2015 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Baxalta\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with Baxter. Baxalta\u2019s historical financial information for such periods was derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Baxter. Accordingly, such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that Baxalta would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that Baxalta will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the separation, Baxalta\u2019s business was operated by Baxter as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Baxter or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for Baxalta, such as tax, treasury, finance, audit, risk management, legal, information technology, human resources, stockholder relations, compliance, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and compensation. Following the separation, Baxter has continued to provide some of these functions to Baxalta, as described in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Baxalta\u2019s historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Baxter for such functions. These allocations may not be indicative of the actual expenses Baxalta would have incurred had it operated as an independent, publicly traded company in the periods presented. Baxalta will make significant investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure, and personnel to which Baxalta no longer has access as a result of the separation. These initiatives to develop Baxalta\u2019s independent ability to operate without access to Baxter\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure will be costly to implement. Baxalta may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline.\n\u2022\nPrior to the separation, Baxalta\u2019s business was integrated with the other businesses of Baxter. Baxalta was able to utilize Baxter\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although Baxalta has entered into transition agreements with Baxter, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits Baxalta enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Baxter and may result in Baxalta paying higher charges than in the past for these services. As a separate, independent company, Baxalta may be unable to obtain goods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the separation, which could decrease Baxalta\u2019s overall profitability. As a separate, independent company, Baxalta may also not be as successful in negotiating favorable tax treatments and credits with governmental entities. This could have a material adverse effect on Baxalta\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for periods following the separation.\n\u2022\nGenerally, prior to the separation, Baxalta\u2019s working capital requirements and capital for its general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, R&D and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Baxter. Following the separation, Baxalta may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.\n\u2022\nAfter the separation, the cost of capital for Baxalta\u2019s business may be higher than Baxter\u2019s cost of capital prior to the distribution.\n\u2022\nBaxalta\u2019s historical financial information does not reflect its obligations to purchase from Baxter certain operations and assets, and assume the corresponding liabilities, of Baxalta\u2019s business after the separation date.\nOther significant changes may occur in Baxalta\u2019s cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Baxter. For additional information about the past financial\nperformance of Baxalta\u2019s business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined financial statements of Baxalta\u2019s business, refer to the discussion in Item 7, Item 8 and the Notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs Baxalta builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, Baxalta could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.\nSince the separation, Baxalta has begun installing and implementing information technology infrastructure to support its critical business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, quality and compliance systems, customer service, inventory control and distribution. Baxalta may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if it cannot transition effectively from Baxter\u2019s existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and the transition services that support these functions as Baxalta replaces these systems. Baxalta may not be successful in implementing its new systems and transitioning its data, and it may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Baxalta\u2019s failure to avoid operational interruptions as it implements the new systems and replaces Baxter\u2019s information technology services, or its failure to implement the new systems and replace Baxter\u2019s services successfully, could disrupt its business and have a material adverse effect on its profitability. In addition, if Baxalta is unable to replicate or transition certain systems, its ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired.\nBaxter may not satisfy its obligations under various transaction agreements that have been executed as part of the separation or Baxalta may not have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transition agreements expire.\nIn connection with the separation, Baxalta and Baxter entered into a separation and distribution agreement and entered into various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a long term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholder\u2019s and registration rights agreement with respect to Baxter\u2019s continuing ownership of Baxalta common stock and certain other commercial agreements. These agreements are discussed in greater detail in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation. Baxalta will rely on Baxter to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Baxter is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, Baxalta could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nIf Baxalta does not have its own systems and services in place, or if Baxalta does not have agreements with other providers of these services when the transition agreements terminate, Baxalta may not be able to operate its business effectively and its profitability may decline. Baxalta is in the process of creating its own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services Baxter currently provides to it. Baxalta may not be successful in effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from Baxter\u2019s systems to Baxalta\u2019s, which could disrupt Baxalta\u2019s business and have a material adverse effect on its profitability. These systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and services Baxter is providing and is expected to provide during the transition period.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Baxter pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially adversely affect Baxalta.\nThe separation and distribution agreement with Baxter provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between Baxter and Baxalta with respect to and resulting from the separation. For a description of the separation and distribution agreement, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter - The Separation and Distribution Agreement,\u201d which includes additional details regarding the scope of Baxalta\u2019s indemnification obligations. Among other things, the\nseparation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the separation pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, including any pending or future litigation. These indemnification liabilities are intended to ensure that, as between Baxter and Baxalta, Baxalta is responsible for all liabilities assumed by it in connection with the separation, and that any liability incurred by Baxter (including directors, officers, employees and agents) related to Baxalta\u2019s failure to satisfy such obligations or otherwise in respect of Baxalta\u2019s operation of its business or any breach by Baxalta of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement is paid by Baxalta, provided that such indemnification obligations shall not extend to individuals who were or become directors, officers, employees or agents of Baxalta if such persons would not be eligible for indemnification under Baxter organizational documents for the underlying matter or if the Baxter directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy would not cover such persons in connection with the applicable matter. Baxalta\u2019s indemnification liabilities are subject to certain limitations under certain ancillary agreements that require Baxalta to act as a service provider for the benefit of Baxter (with Baxter having similar limitations with respect to corresponding services provided to Baxalta) following the separation, but its other indemnification obligations pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and under other ancillary agreements are not generally subject to such limitations. If Baxalta is required to indemnify Baxter under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Baxalta may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nThe spin-off and the Later Distributions (as defined below) could result in significant liability to Baxalta.\nThe spin-off and the Later Distributions (collectively, the Baxter Transactions) are intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under Sections 355, 361, and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the spin-off was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the spin-off was also conditioned upon Baxter\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP (KPMG) regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, an undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.\nIf the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement, Baxalta may be required to indemnify Baxter for any liabilities incurred by Baxter if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by Baxalta following the spin-off (including as a result of the Merger). For additional detail, refer to Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter - Tax Matters Agreement,\u201d and Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cRisk Related to the Proposed Merger with Shire - The Merger could result in significant liability to Baxalta and Shire if it causes the Baxter Transactions to be taxable,\u201d and the immediately following risk factor.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to the \u201cLater Distributions\u201d refer to the following transactions that may be undertaken by Baxter: (i) any debt-for-equity exchange (and related underwritten offering) with respect to Baxalta shares, (ii) any offer to exchange Baxter shares for Baxalta shares, (iii) a contribution of Baxalta shares to Baxter\u2019s U.S. pension fund, and/or (iv) a dividend of Baxalta shares to Baxter\u2019s stockholders, in each case, that are undertaken prior to any Baxalta or Shire stockholder vote with respect to the Merger and that are intended to be part of a plan that includes the spin-off.\nBaxalta may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the separation.\nIn order to preserve the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions to Baxter and its stockholders, the tax matters agreement generally restricts Baxalta from taking or failing to take any action that would cause the Baxter Transactions to become taxable. Under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the separation, Baxalta is prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of more than a certain percentage of its stock or substantially all of its assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating, or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing its capital stock;\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct its business; and\n\u2022\ntaking or failing to take any action that prevents the Baxter Transactions or certain related transactions from being tax-free.\nThe tax matters agreement permits Baxalta to take any of the actions described above if Baxalta provides Baxter with an opinion of counsel or Baxter receives an IRS private letter ruling that, in each case, is reasonably satisfactory to Baxter to the effect that such action will not affect the tax-free status of the Baxter Transactions (or Baxter waives the requirement to obtain such an opinion or ruling). If Baxalta intends to take any such restricted action, Baxter will generally be required to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts with a reasonable request to obtain the tax opinion or IRS ruling as expeditiously as possible. The receipt of any such ruling or opinion in respect of an action Baxalta proposes to take will not relieve Baxalta of its obligation to indemnify Baxter if that action causes the Baxter Transactions to be taxable. These restrictions may limit Baxalta\u2019s ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that it may believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, Baxalta is required to indemnify Baxter against any tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of Baxalta\u2019s stock or assets, even if Baxalta did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nIn connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Baxter agreed in the letter agreement to waive the provisions under the tax matters agreement as they relate to the signing of the merger agreement and will waive such prohibitions in connection with the consummation of the Merger, provided that each of Shire\u2019s and Baxter\u2019s tax advisors furnish the tax opinions referenced in the letter agreement. Such waiver and opinions will not relieve Baxalta or Shire, following the Merger, of its obligation to indemnify Baxter if the Merger causes the Baxter Transactions or certain related transactions to be taxable. For additional detail, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter - Tax Matters Agreement\u201d and Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cRisk Related to the Proposed Merger with Shire - The Merger could result in significant liability to Baxalta and Shire if it causes the Baxter Transactions to be taxable.\u201d\nCertain of Baxalta\u2019s executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at Baxter.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Baxter, certain of Baxalta\u2019s executive officers and directors own shares of Baxter common stock, options to purchase shares of Baxter common stock or other equity awards. Even though Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, and Baxalta\u2019s executive officers who were employees of Baxter ceased to be employees of Baxter, some Baxalta executive officers and directors continue to have a financial interest in shares of Baxter common stock. In addition, three of Baxalta\u2019s directors continue to serve on the Baxter Board of Directors. Continuing ownership of Baxter common stock and equity awards, or service as a director at both companies, could create, or appear to create, potential\nconflicts of interest if Baxalta and Baxter pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for Baxalta and Baxter.\nBaxalta may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s business.\nBaxalta may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others:\n\u2022\ngreater management focus on the distinct business of biopharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nthe ability to commercialize new and existing product offerings more effectively on a global basis;\n\u2022\nthe ability to drive innovation and allocate necessary resources to areas presenting the highest growth potential; and\n\u2022\nthe flexibility to pursue aligned growth and investment strategies resulting in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns.\nBaxalta may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nfollowing the separation, Baxalta may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of Baxter;\n\u2022\nfollowing the separation, Baxalta\u2019s business is less diversified than Baxter\u2019s business prior to the separation; and\n\u2022\nthe other actions required to separate Baxter\u2019s and Baxalta\u2019s respective businesses could disrupt Baxalta\u2019s operations.\nIf Baxalta fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial condition, and results of operations of Baxalta could be adversely affected.\nBaxalta may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms it received in its agreements with Baxter.\nThe agreements Baxalta entered into with Baxter in connection with the separation, including a transition services agreement, a long term services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholder\u2019s and registration rights agreement with respect to Baxter\u2019s continuing ownership of Baxalta common stock and certain other commercial agreements, were prepared in the context of the separation while Baxalta was still a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, Baxalta did not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of Baxter. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between Baxter and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, may have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party. For additional detail, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBaxalta has significant indebtedness which could restrict the company\u2019s ability to pay dividends and have a negative impact on the company\u2019s financing options and liquidity position.\nShortly before the separation, Baxalta incurred approximately $5 billion of indebtedness through the issuance of senior notes. Baxalta used the net proceeds to make a cash distribution of $4 billion to Baxter as partial\nconsideration for the contribution of assets to Baxalta in connection with the separation, with the remaining net proceeds intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund acquisitions. In addition, Baxalta also has a senior revolving credit facility with availability of up to $1.2 billion and a Euro-denominated senior revolving credit facility with availability of up to \u0080200 million. The company may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to restrictions set forth in the merger agreement. The company\u2019s indebtedness may impose restrictions on Baxalta that could have material adverse consequences by:\n\u2022\nlimiting the company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimiting the company\u2019s ability to refinance its indebtedness on terms acceptable to the company or at all;\n\u2022\nimposing restrictive covenants on the company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nrequiring the company to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flows from operations to paying the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nmaking the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting its ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nChallenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s future access to capital.\nBaxalta\u2019s ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for Baxalta\u2019s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect Baxalta\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. These conditions may adversely affect Baxalta\u2019s ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings following the separation.\nRisks Related to Baxalta\u2019s Common Stock\nBaxalta\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of Baxalta\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond Baxalta\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in Baxalta\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or Baxalta\u2019s ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of Shire;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements or speculation regarding proposed business combinations involving Baxalta or comparable companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulatory and legal environment under which Baxalta operates; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions.\nIn addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. This type of lawsuit against Baxalta could cause it to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of its management and other resources.\nFuture sales or distributions of Baxalta common stock may cause the market price for shares of Baxalta common stock to decline.\nAs a result of the separation, Baxter distributed approximately 544 million shares of Baxalta\u2019s common stock to its stockholders, all of which are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the U.S.\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), unless the shares are owned by one of Baxalta\u2019s \u201caffiliates\u201d (including Baxter), as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.\nAfter completion of the distribution, Baxter retained approximately 19.5% of Baxalta\u2019s total shares outstanding. In January 2016, Baxter exchanged a portion of its retained stake in Baxalta common stock for indebtedness of Baxter held by a third party. The shares of Baxalta common stock exchanged were then sold in a secondary public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed by Baxalta. Immediately following the transaction, Baxter held approximately 13.9% of Baxalta\u2019s total shares outstanding. Baxter has advised that it intends to dispose of all of the shares of Baxalta common stock that it retained after the distribution. Such disposition could include one or more subsequent exchanges for debt or equity prior to any Shire or Baxalta stockholder vote with respect to the Merger and, in any event, within the 18-month period following the distribution, including as a result of exchanging shares of Baxalta common stock with a third party, or otherwise disposed of to satisfy Baxter\u2019s outstanding obligations (including through one or more contributions to Baxter\u2019s U.S. pension plan). If any shares of Baxalta common stock are not disposed of by Baxter either prior to the Merger or during such 18-month period, as the case may be, Baxter has advised Baxalta that it intends to otherwise dispose of such shares as soon as practicable thereafter, taking into account market conditions and its business judgment, including potentially through secondary offerings of Baxalta common stock, but in no event later than five years after the distribution. Baxter and Baxalta entered into a shareholder\u2019s and registration rights agreement wherein Baxalta agreed, upon the request of Baxter, to use reasonable best efforts to effect a registration under applicable federal and state securities laws of any shares of Baxalta\u2019s common stock retained by Baxter. Baxter exercised a portion of its demand registration rights pursuant to such agreement to cause Baxalta to register additional shares of our common stock. In connection with the Merger, Baxalta entered into a letter agreement with Baxter and Shire which addresses certain aspects of the shareholder\u2019s and registration rights agreement. For more information, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the captions entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter - Shareholder\u2019s and Registration Rights Agreement\u201d and \u201cAgreements with Baxter - Letter Agreement.\u201d\nDispositions of significant amounts of Baxalta\u2019s common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of Baxalta\u2019s common stock.\nBaxalta cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of any dividends on its common stock.\nThe Board of Directors of Baxalta has adopted a dividend policy with respect to the payment of dividends on Baxalta common stock. However, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends to stockholders will be within the discretion of Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors. The Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as Baxalta\u2019s financial condition, earnings, corporate strategy, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, ability to access capital markets and other factors that the Board deems relevant. For more information, refer to Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cDividends.\u201d Baxalta\u2019s ability to pay any dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. Baxalta cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay dividends in the future. The merger agreement provides that Baxalta may not pay dividends on Baxalta common stock other than regular quarterly cash dividends not to exceed $0.07 per quarter.\nThe current percentage of ownership a stockholder has in Baxalta may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, the percentage ownership of a given stockholder in Baxalta may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that Baxalta has granted and will grant to its directors, officers and employees. Baxalta\u2019s and Baxter\u2019s employees have stock options, stock-settled performance share units and stock-settled restricted stock units for Baxalta\u2019s common stock as a result of an adjustment to their corresponding Baxter awards as described in Item 11 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K under the caption \u201cExecutive Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Elements of Compensation Awards - Equity-Based Incentive Awards.\u201d Baxalta anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional performance share units, restricted stock, stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on Baxalta\u2019s earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of Baxalta\u2019s common stock.\nIn addition, Baxalta\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes Baxalta to issue, without the approval of Baxalta\u2019s stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over Baxalta\u2019s common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Baxalta\u2019s common stock. For example, Baxalta could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of Baxalta\u2019s directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences Baxalta could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThe merger agreement provides that Baxalta may not issue any capital stock except pursuant to its existing equity incentive plans. However, Shire may waive this restriction on issuances without prior notice and such restriction shall continue only so long as the merger agreement is in effect.\nThe public announcement of data from clinical studies or news of any developments related to Baxalta\u2019s product pipeline may cause significant volatility in its stock price. If the development of any of Baxalta\u2019s key pipeline products is delayed or discontinued, the company\u2019s stock price could decline significantly.\nAs Baxalta evolves as a standalone company, it will be focusing efforts and resources in building a diversified pipeline of products in existing core disease areas and into new areas of unmet medical need, such as oncology. The company expects that investors may place heightened scrutiny on some of the company\u2019s products in development when making investment decisions in Baxalta compared to historic Baxter. The announcement of data from clinical studies by the company or its collaborators or news of any developments related to the company\u2019s key pipeline products may cause significant volatility in the company\u2019s stock price. Furthermore, the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of any of Baxalta\u2019s key pipeline products, or any delay in anticipated timelines for filing for regulatory approval, could cause the company\u2019s stock price to decline significantly. There can be no assurance that data from clinical studies will support a filing for regulatory approval or even if approved, that any of Baxalta\u2019s key pipeline products will become commercially successful.\nThe Rights Agreement and certain provisions in Baxalta\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Baxalta by a party other than Shire, which could decrease the trading price of Baxalta\u2019s common stock.\nOn June 29, 2015, Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of common stock. The terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement dated as of June 30, 2015. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Baxalta on terms not approved by Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Baxalta amended certain provisions of the Rights Agreement as they relate to Shire and the proposed Merger.\nBaxalta\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover.\nIn addition, because Baxalta has not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nBaxalta believes these provisions will protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors and by providing Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Baxalta\u2019s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Baxalta and Baxalta\u2019s stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nCertain of the agreements that Baxalta entered into with Baxter require Baxter\u2019s consent to any assignment by Baxalta of its rights and obligations under the agreements. The consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may consider favorable. For more information on these agreements, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter.\u201d\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of Baxalta\u2019s stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, Baxalta is required to indemnify Baxter for the resulting taxes, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may consider favorable. For a description of such indemnification by Baxalta, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter - Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with Shire\nFailure to consummate the Merger could negatively impact the price of Baxalta common stock and our future business and financial results.\nThe consummation of the Merger may be delayed, the Merger may be consummated on terms different than those contemplated by the merger agreement, or the Merger may not be consummated at all. Failure to consummate the Merger would prevent Baxalta stockholders from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. In addition, the consideration offered by Shire reflects a valuation of Baxalta significantly in excess of the price at which Baxalta\u2019s common stock was trading prior to the public announcement of Shire\u2019s interest in the potential combination. The current market price of Baxalta common stock may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will occur, and a failure to consummate the Merger could result in a significant decline in the market price of Baxalta common stock and a negative perception of Baxalta generally. Any delay in the consummation of the Merger or any uncertainty about the consummation of the Merger could also negatively impact the share price and future business and financial results of Baxalta.\nThe market price of the Shire Securities will fluctuate prior to the Merger, so Baxalta stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Shire Securities they will receive if the Merger is consummated.\nIf the Merger is consummated, each outstanding share of Baxalta common stock will be exchanged for both (i) $18.00 in cash and (ii) 0.1482 of a Shire ADS (or, if the Baxalta stockholders elect accordingly and Shire so permits, 0.4446 of a Shire Ordinary Share in lieu of such fraction of a Shire ADS) (we refer to such Shire ADSs and Shire Ordinary Shares together as the Shire Securities) as further described in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cThe Proposed Merger.\u201d Because the number of Shire Securities being\noffered as consideration is fixed, the market value of the Per Share Stock Consideration will be based on the value of Shire Securities at the time the consideration in the Merger is paid. If the market price of Shire Securities declines, Baxalta stockholders could receive less value for their shares of Baxalta common stock upon the consummation of the Merger than the implied value of such shares as of the date the Merger was announced, the date of the Baxalta stockholders\u2019 meeting or as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The market price of the Shire Securities may fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are beyond Baxalta\u2019s control, including general market and economic conditions, changes in business prospects, catastrophic events, both natural and man-made, and regulatory considerations. In addition, the market price of the Shire Securities may significantly fluctuate during the period of time between the date of the merger agreement and the consummation of the Merger, as a result of uncertainty regarding the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, market perception of the synergies and cost savings expected to be achieved related to the Merger, changes to the ongoing business of Baxalta or Shire, including any actions taken by Baxalta\u2019s or Shire\u2019s customers, suppliers, distributors, partners, employees, investors and governmental authorities as a result of the Merger announcement, or actions taken by Baxalta or Shire in connection with the Merger.\nShire and Baxalta must obtain governmental and regulatory approvals to consummate the Merger, which, if delayed or not granted, may delay or jeopardize the Merger.\nThe Merger is conditioned on the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, merger control approval under relevant merger control laws of the European Union and the consent of certain other merger control authorities and other governmental entities. The governmental and regulatory agencies from which Shire and Baxalta are seeking these approvals have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, those agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business. The required approvals may not be obtained or the required conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied, or, even if the required approvals are obtained and the conditions to the consummation of the Merger are satisfied, the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals are uncertain.\nThe closing condition related to anti-trust approval in the United States was satisfied on February 29, 2016, when the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired without a request for additional information being issued.\nAny delay in consummating the Merger could cause the combined company not to realize some or all of the synergies that Shire expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully consummated within the expected time frame.\nThe Merger remains subject to additional conditions, some of which Shire and Baxalta cannot control, which could result in the Merger not being consummated or being delayed, either of which could negatively impact the share price and future business and operating results of Baxalta.\nThe Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of other conditions in addition to the approval of governmental authorities described above, including, but not limited to, the approval of the issuance of the Shire Securities by the stockholders of Shire; the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Baxalta; effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering the Shire Securities to be issued to Baxalta stockholders in the Merger; the absence of any orders, injunctions or rulings that would have the effect of enjoining or preventing the consummation of the Merger; the approval of the UK Listing Authority (UKLA) of a prospectus relating to the Shire Securities and a circular convening the Shire stockholder meeting; approval from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to list the Shire ADS; approval of the UKLA and London Stock Exchange (LSE) to list the Shire Ordinary Shares; and receipt by each of Baxter and Shire of a tax opinion from its respective tax advisor, in each case, substantially in the same form and substance as the tax opinion delivered by such advisor\nin connection with the signing of the merger agreement such that a restriction under the tax matters agreement is waived. Certain conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied or, if they are, the timing of such satisfaction is uncertain. If any conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or, where waiver is permitted by applicable law, not waived, the Merger will not be consummated.\nThe Merger is not subject to a financing condition. While Shire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility, of which $13 billion is available to finance the cash component of the Merger consideration, certain customary conditions precedent to funding must be satisfied in order for Shire to utilize its bank facility, and if such conditions are not satisfied or if Shire\u2019s lenders do not satisfy their funding commitment, Shire may be unable to obtain the funds necessary to consummate the Merger.\nIf for any reason the Merger is not completed, or the closing of the Merger is significantly delayed, the Baxalta share price and business and results of operations of Baxalta may be adversely affected. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger would prevent Baxalta stockholders from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Baxalta has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant transaction fees, professional service fees, taxes and other costs related to the Merger. Further, if the merger agreement is terminated, under certain circumstances, Baxalta may be required to disburse to Shire a termination fee of $369 million and/or reimburse Shire\u2019s expenses in an amount not to exceed $110 million, which expense reimbursement would be offset against any termination fee subsequently paid.\nThe directors and executive officers of Baxalta have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other Baxalta stockholders, which could have influenced their decisions to support or approve the Merger.\nBaxalta stockholders should recognize that the directors and executive officers of Baxalta have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, their interests as stockholders of Baxalta generally. For Baxalta directors, these interests may include the accelerated vesting and payment for certain Baxalta stock-based incentive awards as a result of the merger. For Baxalta executive officers, these interests may include the potential acceleration of stock-based incentive awards as a result of the merger, as well as cash severance payments and benefits that may become payable in connection with the merger. Additionally, Baxalta has agreed to provide \u201cgross-up\u201d payments to individuals for excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (by amending the severance agreements with its executive officers to provide for such payments). Baxalta\u2019s directors and executive officers are also covered by certain indemnification and insurance arrangements. Wayne T. Hockmeyer, Ph.D., chairman of the Baxalta board, will be appointed Shire\u2019s deputy chairman and two additional members of the Baxalta board, who will be jointly selected by the Chairman of the Baxalta board and Chairman of the Shire board following consultation with the Nomination Committee of the Shire board, will be appointed to the Shire board, effective upon the closing of the merger. Such interests and benefits could have influenced the decisions of Baxalta\u2019s directors and executive officers to support or approve the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that restrict Baxalta\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require Baxalta to pay Shire a termination fee and/or expense reimbursement.\nUnder the merger agreement, Baxalta has agreed not to (1) take certain actions to solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (2) subject to certain exceptions, including the receipt of a \u201ccompany superior proposal\u201d (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), enter into discussions or an agreement concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any proposals for alternative business combination transactions. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Baxalta would be required to disburse to Shire a termination fee of $369 million and/or reimburse Shire for its Merger-related expenses in an amount not to exceed $110 million, which reimbursement would be offset against any termination fee subsequently disbursed. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Baxalta from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to enter into a transaction that is more favorable to Baxalta or its stockholders than the Merger.\nIn specified circumstances, Shire could terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal.\nUnder the merger agreement, Shire may terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a \u201cparent superior proposal\u201d (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) prior to obtaining approval of the Merger from its stockholders. In such event, Shire would be obligated to pay Baxalta a termination fee equal to $369 million, but would have no further obligation or liabilities to Baxalta. Such termination would deny Baxalta and Baxalta\u2019s stockholders any benefits from the Merger and could negatively impact Baxalta\u2019s share price.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of employees and may otherwise affect the future business and operations of Baxalta, Shire and the combined company.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Shire or Baxalta and, if the proposed combination with Shire is consummated, on the combined company following the Merger. These consequent uncertainties may impair Shire\u2019s and Baxalta\u2019s ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could also cause customers, suppliers, licensees, partners and others that deal with Shire or Baxalta to defer entering into contracts with, making other decisions concerning, or seeking to change existing business relationships with Shire or Baxalta. Because Baxalta and Shire depend on the experience and industry knowledge of their executives and other key personnel to execute their business plans, the combined company may be unable to meet its strategic objectives.\nWhile the Merger is pending, Baxalta and Shire may not be able to hire qualified personnel to replace any key employees that may depart to the same extent that they have been able to in the past. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Baxalta may also encounter challenges in hiring qualified personnel to replace key employees that may depart Baxalta subsequent to the Merger announcement.\nShire and Baxalta may not successfully integrate.\nIf the Merger is consummated, which will represent Shire\u2019s largest transaction to date, achieving the anticipated benefits of the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta will depend in part upon whether the two companies integrate their businesses in an effective and efficient manner. The companies may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully. The integration of businesses is complex and time-consuming. The difficulties that could be encountered include the following:\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on selling and promoting existing and newly acquired or produced products;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management and employees from operations;\n\u2022\nchanges or conflicts in corporate culture;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s inability to manage a substantial increase in the number of employees;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s inability to train and integrate personnel, who may have limited experience with the respective companies\u2019 business lines and products, and to deliver a consistent message regarding diseases treated by the combined company;\n\u2022\nretaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nretaining existing employees and attracting new employees;\n\u2022\nmaintaining business relationships; and\n\u2022\ninefficiencies associated with the integration and management of the operations of the combined company.\nIn addition, there will be integration costs and non-recurring transaction costs (such as fees paid to legal, financial, accounting and other advisors and other fees paid in connection with the Merger) associated with the proposed Merger, including costs associated with combining operations and achieving the synergies Shire expects to obtain, and such costs may be significant.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta, including estimated cost synergies, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process and realizing such benefits, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may materially adversely affect the value of Shire Securities after the consummation of the Merger.\nShire will incur significant additional indebtedness in connection with the Merger, which will decrease Shire\u2019s business flexibility and increase its interest expense. All of Shire\u2019s debt obligations, and any future indebtedness Shire may incur, will have priority over the Shire Securities with respect to payment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nShire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility, of which $13 billion is available to finance the cash component of the per share merger consideration. Shire has announced that it intends to maintain an investment grade credit rating for the combined company, but one or more credit rating agencies may determine that the combined company\u2019s credit rating is below investment grade, which could increase the combined company\u2019s borrowing costs. The combined company\u2019s indebtedness following consummation of the merger could have the effect, among other things, of reducing the combined company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions as well as reducing funds available for capital expenditures and acquisitions and creating competitive disadvantages for the combined company relative to other companies with lower indebtedness levels. Shire will also incur various costs and expenses associated with the debt financing.\nShire intends to refinance the facilities through capital market debt issuances in due course. Its ability to refinance the indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and the combined company\u2019s financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require the combined company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations and such refinancing may not be available at all.\nMoreover, the combined company may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. The combined company\u2019s ability to arrange additional financing and the costs of that financing will depend on, among other factors, the combined company\u2019s financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond its control.\nIn any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Shire, Shire securities would rank below all debt claims against Shire or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, any convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities that Shire may issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of Shire securities. As a result, holders of Shire securities will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon any liquidation or dissolution until after Shire\u2019s obligations to its debt holders and holders of equity securities which rank senior to the Shire securities have been satisfied.\nThe Merger could result in significant liability to Baxalta and Shire if it causes the Baxter Transactions to be taxable.\nUnder the letter agreement, from and after the closing of the Merger, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses attributable to, or resulting from (in whole or in part) the Merger (as described in more detail in the letter agreement). If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be\ntaxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the Merger (for example, if the Merger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions), Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and under the tax matters agreement and the letter agreement, Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter. Baxter\u2019s waiver of the provisions under the tax matters agreement restricting Baxalta\u2019s ability to enter into and consummate the Merger will not relieve Baxalta (or Shire) of its obligation to indemnify Baxter if the Merger causes any of the Baxter Transactions to be taxable.\nIn connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Shire received an opinion from Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP (Cravath), tax counsel to Shire, to the effect that the Merger will not cause Baxter\u2019s contribution of assets to Baxalta, Baxter\u2019s initial distribution of Baxalta shares on July 1, 2015, Baxter\u2019s distribution of cash received from Baxalta to its creditors or the Later Distributions to fail to qualify as tax-free to Baxter and its stockholders under Sections 355, 361 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The Merger is conditioned on the receipt by Shire at the time of the consummation of the Merger of a tax opinion to the same effect.\nThe opinion referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph is based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or the assumptions in the tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, an undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the tax opinion is based are materially different from the facts at the time of the Merger, the opinion may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the Cravath opinion could be challenged by the IRS. None of Baxalta, Baxter or Shire has requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the impact of the Merger on the tax treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Further, the Cravath opinion does not address all tax aspects of the spin-off, Later Distributions and other related transactions and it is possible that Baxalta and Shire may be obligated to indemnify Baxter despite the continuing validity of the Cravath tax opinion.\nBaxalta\u2019s (and Shire\u2019s) indemnification obligations to Baxter and its subsidiaries, officers, and directors under the tax matters agreement and letter agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If Baxalta or Shire is required to indemnify Baxter and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement (as supplemented by the letter agreement), it could have a material adverse effect on Baxalta and Shire.\nFor a description of the sharing of certain tax liabilities between Baxter and Baxalta, refer to the discussion in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cAgreements with Baxter - Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nSales of Baxalta common stock in anticipation of the Merger, and resales of Shire Securities following the completion of the Merger, may adversely affect the market price of Baxalta common stock prior to the Merger, and, after the Merger, the market price of Shire Securities.\nCertain Baxalta stockholders, such as index funds or funds with concentration, geographic or other limitations on their permitted investments, may be required to sell the Shire Securities that they receive in the transaction. Other Baxalta stockholders may already hold Shire Securities and those stockholders may decide not to hold the additional Shire Securities they receive in the Merger, or to sell their Baxalta shares prior to the Merger. Such sales of Baxalta common stock or Shire Securities could have the effect of depressing the market price of Shire Securities and Baxalta common stock.\nIf the Merger is consummated, Shire will issue new Shire Securities to Baxalta stockholders. The issuance of these new shares and the sale of additional shares that may become eligible for sale in the public market from time to time upon exercise of options or the vesting of restricted securities could have the effect of depressing the market price for Shire Securities. Moreover, the increase in the number of Shire Securities, or an increase in the number of Shire Securities outstanding following a future issuance, sale or transfer of Shire Securities by Shire or the possibility of such an issue, sale or transfer may lead to sales of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market price of, Shire Securities.\nThe market price of Shire Securities may be adversely affected by reports of third-party analysts published in connection with the consummation of the Merger.\nThe trading market for Shire Securities depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about Shire and its industry. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, one or more of these analysts could downgrade Shire Securities or issue other negative commentary about Shire or its industry, which could cause the market price of Shire Securities to decline.\nThe market price of Shire Securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting the market price of Baxalta common stock.\nIf the Merger is consummated, Baxalta stockholders will become holders of Shire Securities. Shire\u2019s business differs from that of Baxalta, and Shire\u2019s results of operations, as well as the market price of Shire Securities, may be affected by factors different from those affecting Baxalta\u2019s results of operations and the market price of Baxalta common stock.\nExchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the foreign currency value of Shire Securities and any dividends.\nIf the Merger is consummated, Baxalta common stock will be exchanged for Shire Securities. Unlike Baxalta, as a consequence of Shire\u2019s dual listing on both the NASDAQ and LSE, Shire Ordinary Shares are quoted in pounds sterling on the LSE and Shire ADS are quoted in U.S. dollars on the NASDAQ. Dividends in respect of Shire Ordinary Shares, if any, will be declared in U.S. dollars. Shire\u2019s financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and pounds sterling will affect, among other matters, the pounds sterling value of Shire Ordinary Shares and of any dividends in respect of such shares.\nThe Shire Securities have different rights from the shares of Baxalta common stock.\nCertain of the rights associated with Baxalta common stock are different from the rights associated with Shire Securities. In particular, the law of Jersey, in which Shire is organized, significantly limits the circumstances under which stockholders of companies may bring derivative actions and, in most cases, only the corporation may be the claimant or plaintiff for the purposes of maintaining proceedings in respect of any wrongful act committed against it. Neither an individual nor any group of stockholders has any right of action in such circumstances. In addition, Jersey law does not afford appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders in the form typically available to stockholders of a U.S. corporation.\nOnly registered holders of Shire Securities are afforded the rights of stockholders under Jersey law, the Shire Memorandum of Association and the Shire Articles of Association. Because the depositary\u2019s nominee will be the registered owner of the shares, holders of Shire ADS must rely on the nominee to exercise the rights of a stockholder on their behalf.\nIf the Merger is consummated, Baxalta stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest and will exercise less influence over the management and policies of Shire than they do over Baxalta.\nBaxalta stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Baxalta Board of Directors and on other matters affecting Baxalta. If the Merger is consummated, each Baxalta stockholder will become a holder of Shire Securities with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of Baxalta. Shire estimates that, upon the consummation of the Merger, former Baxalta stockholders would own, in the aggregate, approximately 34% of all outstanding Shire Ordinary Shares on a diluted basis. Accordingly, Baxalta stockholders would have less influence over the management and policies of Shire than they now have over the management and policies of Baxalta.\nHolders of Shire Securities in the United States may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against Shire.\nA number of Shire\u2019s directors and executive officers are not residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to affect service of process within the United States upon such persons or to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.\nThere is also a doubt as to the enforceability in England, Wales and Jersey, whether by original actions or by seeking to enforce judgments of U.S. courts, of claims based on the federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in England, Wales and Jersey.\nLawsuits have been filed and additional lawsuits may be filed against Baxalta, Shire and the Baxalta board challenging the Merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the completion of the Merger or result in an award of damages against Baxalta.\nFollowing announcement of the Merger, putative class action complaints were filed by purported Baxalta stockholders on behalf of all Baxalta stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Illinois. The complaints filed in the State of Delaware have since been dismissed, but additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or the Merger may be filed in the future. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger. The existence of litigation relating to the Merger could impact the likelihood of obtaining the stockholder approvals from either Baxalta or Shire. Moreover, the pending litigation is, and any future additional litigation could be, time consuming and expensive and could divert Baxalta\u2019s and Shire\u2019s respective management\u2019s attention away from their regular business. One of the conditions to completion of the Merger is the absence of any law or judgment issued by any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the closing of the Merger. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining a judgment prohibiting completion of the Merger, then such judgment may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected time frame.
