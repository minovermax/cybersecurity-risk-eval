{"cik": "1573221", "company": "TheRealReal, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIf we fail to generate a sufficient amount of new and recurring supply of pre-owned luxury goods by attracting and retaining consignors, our business would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to cost-effectively attract, retain and grow relationships with consignors, and in turn, our supply of luxury goods sold through our online marketplace. To expand our consignor base, we must appeal to and engage individuals new to consignment, or who have consigned through traditional brick-and-mortar shops but are unfamiliar with our business. We find new consignors by converting buyers utilizing our online marketplace, shopping in our four retail stores, utilizing our ten luxury consignment offices (\u201cLCOs\u201d), paid advertising, referral programs, organic word-of-mouth and other methods of discovery, such as mentions in the press, Internet search engine results and through our partnerships with Stella McCartney and Burberry. We recently increased our paid marketing expenses by investing more in television advertising and digital marketing and we expect to increase our spending on these and other paid marketing channels in the future. We cannot be certain that these efforts will yield more consignors or be cost-effective. Moreover, new consignors may not choose to consign with us a second time or consign as frequently, or consign as many items or the same value of items, as has historically been the case with existing consignors. Therefore, the revenue generated from new consignors may not be as high as the revenue generated historically from our existing consignors or as high as we expect. In addition, a significant number of our new and existing consignors greatly prefer our White Glove consultation method for consigning luxury goods, which involves our sales professionals meeting with our consignors in their homes. Threats to public health, such as the novel corona virus (COVID-19), could significantly impact our consignors\u2019 willingness to allow our sales professionals into their homes or we may determine that it is in the best interests of our sales professionals to reduce or temporarily discontinue offering our White Glove consultation method. These new and existing consignors may not be as willing, or willing at all, to utilize our other methods for consignment. If we fail to attract new consignors, drive repeat consignments or other factors impact our consignment methods, our ability to grow our business would be adversely affected.\nOur ability to drive growth also depends on our success in continuing to generate a high volume of consigned items from new and existing consignors. To accomplish this, we rely on our sales professionals to drive our supply of luxury goods by identifying, developing and maintaining relationships with our consignors. Our sales professionals source high-quality, coveted luxury goods from consignors through a variety of methods including White Glove consultation, meeting with potential consignors in one of our ten LCOs or shipping consigned goods to us from remote locations. The process of identifying and hiring sales professionals with the combination of skills and attributes required in these roles can be difficult and can require significant time. In addition, competition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail industry is intense and turnover amongst our sales professionals within a few years is not uncommon. Any shortage in sales professionals or delay in identifying and hiring quality sales professionals could have a negative impact on the business. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining effective sales professionals, the quantity and quality of the luxury goods sold through our online marketplace may be negatively impacted, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe may not be able to attract, train and retain specialized personnel and skilled employees to effectively manage the merchandising operations required to authenticate, process and sell consigned luxury goods or identify and lease merchandising and fulfillment facilities in geographic regions that enable us to effectively scale our operations.\nWe lease facilities to store and accommodate the logistics infrastructure required to merchandise and ship the pre-owned luxury goods we sell through our online marketplace. To grow our business, we must continue to improve and expand our merchandising and fulfillment operations, information systems and skilled personnel in the jurisdictions in which we operate so that we have the skilled talent necessary to effectively operate our business. The operation of our business is complex and requires the coordination of multiple functions that are highly dependent on numerous employees and personnel. Each luxury item that we offer through our online marketplace is unique and requires multiple touch points, including inspection, evaluation, authentication, photography, pricing, copywriting, application of a unique single-SKU and fulfillment. We have rapidly increased our operations employee headcount to support the growth of our business. The market for these employees is increasingly competitive and is highly dependent on geographic location. Some of our employees have specific knowledge and skills that would make it more difficult to hire replacement personnel capable of effectively performing the same tasks without substantial training. We also provide specific training to our employees in each of our business functions in order to provide our consignors and buyers with a consistent luxury experience. If we fail to effectively locate, hire, train and retain such personnel, our operations would be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to successfully grow our business also depends on the availability and cost of leasing additional merchandising and fulfillment facilities that meet our criteria for a geographic location with access to a large, qualified talent pool, square footage, cost and other factors. We currently have four merchandising and fulfillment facilities-one in California and three in New Jersey. Optimal space is becoming increasingly scarce, and where it is available, the lease terms offered by landlords are increasingly competitive. Incentives currently offered by local, state and federal entities to offset operating expenses may be reduced or become unavailable. Companies who have more financial resources and negotiating leverage than us may be more attractive tenants and, as a result, may outbid us for the facilities we seek. We also may be unable to renew our existing leases or renew them on satisfactory terms. Failure to identify and secure adequate new merchandising and fulfillment facilities in optimal geographic locations or maintain our current merchandising and fulfillment facilities could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe experienced net losses of $96.7 million, $75.8 million, and $52.3 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and as of December 31, 2019 we had an accumulated deficit of $354.5 million. We believe there is substantial opportunity for growth in our business and our market and intend to invest aggressively to capitalize on this opportunity. As a result of these investments, we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. In particular, we are making significant investments in our marketing initiatives, expanding our operations and infrastructure, developing and introducing new technologies and automation and hiring additional personnel. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in revenue growth. In addition, in connection with operating as a public company, we are incurring additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. If our investments do not prove successful or our market does not develop as we expect, we may continue to experience losses over the long term. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability and may continue to incur significant losses going forward.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or effectively manage growth.\nOur recent revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. As we grow our business, we expect our future revenue growth rates may slow due to a number of factors, including the maturation of our business, increased market adoption against which future growth will be measured, increasing competition or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. Additionally, consignors may opt to consign less with us to the extent we take steps, such as increasing our take rates, that make our online marketplace appear less attractive to them. Alternatively, the emergence of direct competitors may force us to decrease our take rates to remain competitive to attract consignors, which will have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, rapid growth, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our consignors and buyers, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. To support anticipated growth, we are committing substantial financial, operational and technical resources. Failure to effectively manage the growth of our business and operations would negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and operating results.\nNational retailers and brands set their own retail prices and promotional discounts on new luxury goods, which could adversely affect our value proposition to consumers.\nNational retailers and brands set pricing for new luxury goods. Promotional pricing by these parties may adversely affect the value of products consigned with us and our inventory, and, in turn, GMV and operating results. In order to attract buyers to our online marketplace, the prices for the pre-owned luxury goods sold through our online marketplace may need to be lowered in order to compete with these pricing strategies, which could negatively affect gross merchandise value and in turn, our revenue. We have experienced a reduction in our GMV and AOV in the past due to fluctuations in the price of new luxury goods sold by retailers and brands, and we anticipate similar reductions and fluctuations in the future. However, the timing and magnitude of such discounting can be difficult to predict. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have a relatively short operating history in an evolving industry and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\nOur online marketplace represents a substantial departure from the traditional resale market for luxury goods. While our business has grown rapidly, the resale market for luxury goods may not continue to develop in a manner that we expect or that otherwise would be favorable to our business. Our relatively short operating history and the changes in our market make it difficult to assess our future performance. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncost-effectively acquire and engage with new and existing consignors and buyers and grow our supply of high-quality, coveted luxury goods for sale through our online marketplace;\n\u2022\nscale our revenue and achieve the operating efficiencies necessary to achieve and maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nincrease consignor and buyer awareness of our brand;\n\u2022\nanticipate and respond to changing consignor and buyer preferences;\n\u2022\nmanage and improve our business processes in response to changing business needs;\n\u2022\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes generally, including changes in both the primary and secondary market for luxury goods;\n\u2022\neffectively scale our operations while maintaining high service quality and consignor and buyer satisfaction;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain talented people at all levels of our business;\n\u2022\navoid or manage interruptions in our business from information technology downtime, cybersecurity breaches and other factors affecting our physical and digital infrastructure;\n\u2022\nfulfill and deliver orders in a timely manner and in accordance with customer expectations, which may change over time;\n\u2022\nmaintain the quality of our technology and operations infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndevelop new technology or services to enhance the consignor and buyer experience; and\n\u2022\ncomply with regulations applicable to our business.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, our business and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends.\nOur business and operating results are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending, particularly in the luxury goods market. Some of the factors that may negatively influence consumer spending on luxury goods include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth, and declines in asset values and related market uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices and general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Consumer purchases of new luxury goods have declined during periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. Such economic uncertainty and decrease in the rate of luxury purchases in the primary market may slow the rate at which individuals choose to consign their goods with us which could result in a decrease of items available in our online marketplace.\nAs an online marketplace for pre-owned luxury goods, our success depends on the accuracy of our authentication process. Failure by us to identify counterfeit goods could adversely affect our reputation, subject us to adverse publicity, and expose us to liability for the sale of counterfeit goods.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately and cost-effectively determine whether an item offered for consignment is an authentic product, a genuine gemstone or piece of jewelry or work of art. From time to time, we receive counterfeit goods for consignment. While we continue to invest and innovate in our authentication processes, and we reject any goods we believe to be counterfeit, we cannot be certain that we will identify every counterfeit item that is consigned to us. As the sophistication of counterfeiters increases, it may be increasingly difficult to identify counterfeit products. We refund the cost of a product to a buyer if the buyer questions its authenticity and returns the item. The sale of any counterfeit goods may damage our reputation as a trusted online marketplace for authenticated, pre-owned luxury goods which may impact our ability to attract and maintain consignors and buyers. Additionally, we have been and may in the future be subject to public allegations that our authentication processes are inadequate. Such controversy could negatively impact our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results. Any material failure or perceived failure in our authentication operations could cause buyers and consignors to lose confidence in our platform and adversely affect our revenue.\nWe may not succeed in promoting and sustaining our brand, which could have an adverse effect on our business and future growth.\nWe believe that maintaining The RealReal brand is critical to driving consignor and buyer engagement. An important goal of our brand promotion strategy is establishing trust with our consignors and buyers. Maintaining our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue providing our consignors with service that is consistent with the level of luxury associated with the goods they are consigning and delivering value for the goods they consign, all in a timely and consistent manner. Our success depends in part on the quality of our sales professionals who represent our brand to new and existing consignors. Sales professionals cultivate relationships with our consignor base by making in-home visits to evaluate the luxury goods that our consignors want to consign. While we require that all sales professionals undergo a background check, this may not prevent illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate actions by such employees, such as theft or physical assault, from occurring in connection with our services. Any negative publicity related to the foregoing could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our model of luxury consignment, which could negatively affect demand for our services and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor buyers, maintaining our brand requires that we foster trust through authentication, timely and reliable fulfillment of orders, and responsive and effective customer service. If we fail to provide consignors or buyers with the service and experience they expect, or experience consignor or buyer complaints or negative publicity about our online marketplace services, merchandise, delivery times or customer support, whether justified or not, the value of our brand would be harmed and our business may suffer.\nOur continued growth depends on attracting new and retaining repeat buyers.\nTo expand our buyer base, we must appeal to and attract buyers who do not typically purchase luxury goods, who have historically purchased only new luxury goods or who used other means to purchase pre-owned luxury goods, such as traditional brick-and-mortar consignment shops, auction houses and the websites of other secondary marketplaces. We reach new buyers through television and digital advertising, other paid marketing, press coverage, referral programs, organic word of mouth and other methods of discovery, such as converting consignors to buyers. We expect to continue investing heavily in these and other marketing channels in the future and cannot be certain that these efforts will yield more buyers or be cost-effective. Moreover, new buyers may not purchase through our online marketplace as frequently or spend as much with us as historically has been the case with existing buyers. As a result, the revenue generated from new buyer transactions may not be as high as the revenue generated from transactions with our existing buyers. Failure to attract new buyers and to maintain relationships with existing buyers would adversely affect our operating results and our ability to attract and retain consignors.\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to lawsuits and other claims that are expensive and time consuming, could lead to adverse publicity, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe rely on the fair use doctrine when we routinely refer to third-party intellectual property, such as trademarks, on our platform. Third parties may dispute the scope of that doctrine and challenge our ability to reference their intellectual property in the course of our business. For instance, from time to time, we are contacted by companies controlling brands of goods consignors sell, demanding that we cease referencing those brands in connection with such sales, whether in advertising or on our website. We have consistently responded by reference to the holding in Tiffany (NY), Inc. v. eBay that factual use of a brand to describe and sell a used good is not false advertising. These matters have generally been resolved with no further communications, but some have resulted in litigation against us. For example, in November 2018, Chanel, Inc. (\u201cChanel\u201d) filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York bringing various trademark and advertising-related claims under the Lanham Act and New York state law analogues. Chanel alleges, among other things, that we have misrepresented certain counterfeit Chanel products as authentic Chanel products, that our resale of Chanel products confuses consumers into believing that Chanel is affiliated with us and involved in authenticating consignors\u2019 goods and that only Chanel is capable of authenticating second-hand Chanel goods. This litigation is in its early stages and the final outcome, including our liability, if any, with respect to Chanel\u2019s claims, is uncertain. Chanel could in the future assert additional trademark and advertising or other claims against us in this or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in this or similar litigation could adversely affect our business and could lead to other similar lawsuits.\nWe are also at risk of claims by others that we have infringed their copyrights, trademarks or patents or improperly used or disclosed their trade secrets. In particular, third parties may allege that goods consigned to us are counterfeit or that by offering goods of a particular brand we are suggesting that we are sponsored by or affiliated with that brand. The costs of resolving any litigation or disputes related to these claims can be considerable, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve a favorable outcome of any such claim.\nIn addition, the Company, its officers and directors and the underwriters of the Company\u2019s initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) have been named as defendants in numerous purported securities class actions in connection with the Company\u2019s IPO (the \u201cSecurities Litigation\u201d). See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for a description of the Securities Litigation.\nIn addition, we have in the past and could face in the future a variety of employee claims against us, including but not limited to general discrimination, privacy, wage and hour, labor and employment, ERISA and disability claims. Any claims could also result in litigation against us or regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues and create risks and uncertainties.\nDefending litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. The results of any such litigation, investigations and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Although we have insurance, it provides for a substantial retention of liability and is subject to limitations. As a result, it may not cover a significant portion, or any, of the expenses we may incur or be subject to in connection with shareholder class action or other litigation to which we are party. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third-party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. Our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nThe operations of our facilities and our retail stores could be affected by the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nWe currently have four merchandising and fulfillment facilities- one in California and three in New Jersey. In addition, we operate retail stores in California and New York. Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of facilities.\nThe recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could pose public health risks that could reach epidemic or global pandemic proportions. This outbreak could directly threaten the health of our employees, our consignors and our customers. The operation of all of our facilities is critically dependent on our employees who staff these locations. In addition, the federal or state governments, or both, could impose restrictions ranging from limitations on public interaction to mandatory quarantine in affected areas.\nAny events that threaten the operation of our facilities or retail stores, including the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), could have a material adverse effect or our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to successfully leverage technology to automate and drive efficiencies in our operations, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are building automation, machine learning and other capabilities to drive efficiencies in our merchandising and fulfillment operations. As we continue to add capacity, capabilities and automation, our operations will become increasingly complex and challenging. While we expect these technologies to improve productivity in many of our merchandising operations, including pricing, copywriting, authentication, photography and photo retouching, any flaws or failures of such technologies could cause interruptions in and delays to our operations which may harm our business. We are increasing our investment in technology to support these efforts but they may not be effective in driving productivity, maintaining or improving the experience for buyers and consignors or providing a positive return on investment. We have created our own purpose-built technology to operate our business, but we also rely on technology from third parties. If these technologies do not perform in accordance with our expectations, third parties change the terms and conditions that govern their relationships with us, or if competition increases for the technology and services provided by third parties, our business may be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to add automation to our operations, we may be unable to reduce the costs of processing consignments and fulfilling orders, which could cause delays in buyers receiving their purchases. Any of these outcomes could harm our reputation and our relationships with our consignors and buyers.\nOur advertising activity may fail to efficiently drive growth in consignors and buyers.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising, promotion, public relations and marketing programs and we are investing heavily in these activities. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and the efficacy of these activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u2022\ndetermine the effective creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u2022\nselect the right markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise;\n\u2022\nidentify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market, media and specific media vehicle; and\n\u2022\neffectively manage marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, to maintain acceptable consignor and buyer acquisition costs.\nWe closely monitor the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and changes in the advertising market, and adjust or re-allocate our advertising spend across channels, customer segments and geographic markets in real-time to optimize the effectiveness of these activities. We expect to increase advertising spend in future periods to continue driving our growth. Increases in the pricing of one or more of our marketing and advertising channels could increase our marketing and advertising expenses or cause us to choose less expensive but possibly less effective marketing and advertising channels. If we implement new marketing and advertising strategies, we may incur significantly higher costs than our current channels, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operating results.\nImplementing new marketing and advertising strategies also could increase the risk of devoting significant capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. We also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. Even if our marketing and advertising expenses result in increased sales, the increase might not offset our related expenditures. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly or more effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, our consignor and buyer base could be adversely affected, and our business, operating results, financial condition and brand could suffer.\nWe may experience damage or destruction to our merchandising and fulfillment facilities or retail stores in which we store all of the consigned luxury goods we offer through our online marketplace which may materially adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe store the majority of the luxury goods we offer through our online marketplace in our merchandising and fulfillment facilities in California and New Jersey, with a small portion of luxury goods offered for sale in our four retail stores. Our merchandising and fulfillment facilities are located in areas that have a history of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and severe weather events, rendering our merchandising and fulfillment facilities vulnerable to damage. Any large scale damage to or catastrophic loss of goods stored in such merchandising and fulfillment facilities or retail stores, due to natural disasters or man-made disasters such as arson or theft or otherwise would result in liability to our consignors for the expected commission liability for the lost items, reduction in the value of our inventory and a significant disruption to our business. Additionally, given the nature of the unique consigned luxury goods we offer on our online marketplace, our ability to restore the supply of consigned luxury goods on our online marketplace would take time and would result in a limitation and delay of available supply for buyers which would negatively impact our revenue and operating results. While we carry insurance for the consigned luxury goods stored in these merchandising and fulfillment facilities, the number of carriers which provide for such insurance has declined, which has resulted in increased premiums and deductibles. The insurance we do carry may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and, in any event, may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our business could suffer. In the event that we suffer a catastrophic loss of any or all of our merchandising and fulfillment facilities and the consigned luxury goods stored in such facilities, our liabilities may exceed the maximum insurance coverage amount which would materially adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe have experienced seasonal and quarterly variations in our revenue and operating results and, as a result, our quarterly results may fluctuate and could be below expectations.\nOur business is seasonal and historically we have realized a disproportionate amount of our revenue and earnings for the year in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season and seasonal promotions. We expect this to continue in the future. In anticipation of increased activity during the fourth quarter, we incur significant additional expenses, including additional marketing and staffing in our sales and customer support operations. In addition, we may experience an increase in our shipping costs due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. At peak periods, there could also be further delays in processing consigned goods or fulfilling buyer orders, which could lead to lower consignor and/or buyer satisfaction. As a result of increased expenses or delays in shipping, if we experience lower than expected revenue during any fourth quarter, it may have a disproportionately large impact on our operating results and financial condition for that year. Any factors that harm our fourth quarter operating results, including disruptions in our consignors\u2019 willingness to consign or unfavorable economic conditions, or adverse weather could have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for our entire fiscal year. In the future, our seasonal sales patterns may become more pronounced, may strain our personnel and may cause a shortfall in revenue related to expenses in a given period, which could substantially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe resale market for luxury goods is highly competitive. We compete with vendors of new and pre-owned luxury goods, including branded luxury goods stores, department stores, traditional brick-and-mortar consignment stores, pawn shops, auction houses, specialty retailers, discount chains, independent retail stores, the online offerings of these traditional retail competitors, resale players focused on niche or single categories, as well as technology-enabled marketplaces that may offer the same or similar luxury goods and services that we offer. We believe our ability to compete depends on many factors within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nengaging and enhancing our relationships with existing consignors and buyers and attracting new consignors and buyers;\n\u2022\nfurther developing our data science capabilities;\n\u2022\nmaintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively delivering our online marketplace to consignors and buyers;\n\u2022\nidentifying and delivering authentic luxury goods;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and increasing the amount, diversity and quality of brands and luxury goods that we or our competitors offer;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand the categories of luxury goods our consignors consign and sell;\n\u2022\nthe price at which consigned, authenticated luxury goods through our online marketplace are offered;\n\u2022\nthe speed and cost at which we can authenticate and make available consigned luxury goods and deliver purchased goods to our buyers; and\n\u2022\nthe ease with which our consignors and buyers can consign, purchase and return goods.\nFailure to adequately meet these demands may cause us to lose potential consignors and buyers which could harm our business.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater brand recognition and technical capabilities, faster shipping times, lower-cost shipping, larger databases, greater financial, marketing, institutional and other resources and larger buyer bases than we do. As the market evolves, competitors may emerge. For example, Farfetch Ltd recently announced the launch of a new consignment service. Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do, which may allow them to derive greater revenue and profits from their existing buyer bases, acquire consignors at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer shopping behavior. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, enter the business of online luxury consignment, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger consignor or buyer bases or generate revenue from their existing buyer bases more effectively than we do. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to host our website and mobile app and to process payments made by buyers or to consignors on our online marketplace. Any significant disruption in service provided by, or termination of our relationship with, such third parties could damage our reputation and result in loss of buyers and consignors, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nOur brand and ability to attract and retain consignors and buyers depends in part on the reliable performance of our network infrastructure and content delivery process. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience, interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints which could affect the availability of services on our platform and prevent or inhibit the ability of buyers to access our online marketplace or complete purchases on our website and app. We currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS\u2019 facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. The continuing and uninterrupted performance of our online marketplace is critical to our success. Volume of traffic and activity on our online marketplace spikes on certain days and during certain periods of the year, such as during a Black Friday promotion and generally during the fourth quarter due to the seasonality of our business, and any interruption would be particularly problematic if it were to occur at such a high volume time. We also use Google services for our business emails, file storage and communications. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from Google could harm our ability to run our business.\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by buyers or to consignors on our online marketplace. If our third-party payment processors terminate their relationships with us or refuse to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processors in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments, make payments to consignors or conduct other payment transactions, any of which could make our platform less convenient and attractive and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain buyers and consignors.\nWe must successfully gauge and respond to changing preferences among our consignors and buyers.\nOur success is in large part dependent upon our ability to anticipate and identify trends in the market for pre-owned luxury goods in a timely manner and to obtain consignments of luxury goods that address those trends. We use data science to predict consignor and buyer preferences, and there can be no assurance that our data science will accurately anticipate consignor or buyer requirements. Lead times relating to these changing preferences may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing trends. We have begun to expand our offerings and the impact on our business from these new offerings is not clear as it is difficult to accurately predict consignor and buyer preferences. To the extent we do not accurately predict the evolving preferences of our consignors and buyers, our ability to grow our business and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, including those relating to the sale of secondhand goods, may subject us to fines, penalties, loss of licensure, registration, facility closures and approval or other governmental enforcement action.\nThe sale of consigned goods through our online marketplace is subject to regulation, including by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other international, federal, state and local governments and regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are complex, vary from state to state and change often. We monitor these laws and regulations and adjust our business practices as warranted to comply. We receive luxury goods on consignment from numerous consignors located in all 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, and the goods we receive from our consignors may contain materials such as fur, python, ivory and other exotic animal product components, that are subject to regulation. Our standard consignor terms and conditions require consignors to comply with applicable laws when consigning their goods. Failure of our consignors to comply with applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation or other claims against us, resulting in increased legal expenses and costs. Moreover, failure by us to effectively monitor the application of these laws and regulations to our business, and to comply with such laws and regulations, may negatively affect our brand and subject us to penalties and fines.\nNumerous U.S. states and municipalities, including the States of California, New York and Florida, have regulations regarding the handling and sale of secondhand goods, and licensing requirements for secondhand dealers. Such government regulations could require us to change the way we conduct business, or our buyers to conduct their purchases in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues, such as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the sale or shipment of certain items in some locations. We could also be subject to business interruption, fines or other penalties which in the aggregate could harm our business. To the extent we fail to comply with requirements for secondhand dealers, we may experience unanticipated permanent or temporary shutdowns of our facilities which may negatively affect our ability to increase the supply of our goods, result in negative publicity and subject us to penalties and fines.\nAdditionally, the luxury goods our consignors sell could be subject to recalls and other remedial actions and product safety, labeling and licensing concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected goods from our online marketplace. Such recalls or voluntary removal of goods can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs and legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nSome of the luxury goods sold through our online marketplace on behalf of our consignors may expose us to product liability claims and litigation or regulatory action relating to personal injury, environmental or property damage. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. In addition, while all of our vendor agreements contain a standard indemnification provision, certain vendors may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations which may harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties to drive traffic to our website, and these providers may change their algorithms or pricing in ways that could negatively impact our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely in part on digital advertising, including search engine marketing, to promote awareness of our online marketplace, grow our business, attract new consignors and buyers and increase engagement with existing consignors and buyers. In particular, we rely on search engines, such as Google, and the major mobile app stores as important marketing channels. Search engine companies change their search algorithms periodically, and our ranking in searches may be adversely impacted by those changes. Search engine companies or app stores may also determine that we are not in compliance with their guidelines and penalize us as a result. If search engines change their algorithms, terms of service, display or the featuring of search results, determine we are out of compliance with their terms of service or if competition increases for advertisements, we may be unable to cost-effectively add consignors and buyers to our website and apps. Our relationships with our marketing vendors are not long term in nature and do not require any specific performance commitments. In addition, many of our online advertising vendors provide advertising services to other companies, including companies with whom we may compete. As competition for online advertising has increased, the cost for some of these services has also increased. Our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a return on those initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, such increase may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur.\nGreater than expected product returns could have a negative impact on our revenue.\nWe generally allow buyers to return certain purchases from our website and retail stores under our return policy. We record a reserve for returns against proceeds to us from the sale of goods on our online marketplace in calculating revenue. We estimate this reserve based on historical return trends. The introduction of new products in the retail market, changes in consumer confidence or other competitive and general economic conditions may also cause actual returns to exceed our reserve for returns. We believe adverse economic conditions in the past have resulted in an increase in our returns, and we have also experienced higher than expected returns in connection with fourth quarter holiday buying. Additionally, most of the consigned luxury goods are valuable and require special handling and delivery. From time to time, such goods are damaged in transit which can increase return rates, increase our costs and harm our brand. Returned goods may also be damaged in transit as part of the return process which can significantly impact the price we are able to charge for such goods on our online marketplace. Any significant increase in returns that exceeds our reserves could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nCompromises of our data security could cause us to incur unexpected expenses, compromise our data assets and may materially harm our reputation and operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store certain personal information and other data relating to individuals, such as our consignors, buyers and employees. We also maintain other information, such as our trade secrets and confidential business information, that is sensitive and that we seek to protect. We rely substantially on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for our processing, transmission and storage of personal information and other confidential information. We or our vendors could be the subject of hacking, social engineering, phishing attacks or other attacks. Due to these or other causes, we or our vendors may suffer a data breach or other security incident, which may allow hackers or other unauthorized parties to gain access to personal information or other data, including payment card data or confidential business information, and we might not discover such issues for an extended period. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target. As a result, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our employees, contractors, vendors or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate such personal information, confidential information or other data, or may inadvertently release or compromise such data. We and our vendors have faced these attacks previously and regularly must defend against or respond to such incidents. We expect to incur ongoing costs associated with the detection and prevention of security breaches and other security-related incidents. We may incur additional costs in the event of a security breach or other security-related incident. Any actual or perceived compromise of our systems or data security measures or those of third parties with whom we do business, or any failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or other confidential information and delays in detecting or providing notice of any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, harm the perception of our security measures, damage our reputation, cause some participants to decrease or stop their use of our online marketplace and subject us to litigation, government action, increased transaction fees, regulatory fines or penalties or other additional costs and liabilities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nOur use and other processing of personal information and other data is subject to laws and obligations relating to privacy and data protection, and our failure to comply with such laws and obligations could harm our business.\nNumerous state, federal and international laws, rules and regulations govern privacy, data protection and the collection, use and protection of personal information and other types of data we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process. These laws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving, and we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions. For example, California enacted legislation that came into effect January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), that requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers qualified new privacy rights, such as rights of access, deletion and to opt-out of the sales of their personal information. The CCPA includes provisions that sunset at the end of 2020, may be amended or replaced, and Attorney General regulations have not yet been finalized. It remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the CCPA or how it will be interpreted. The CCPA may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Similarly, the European Commission adopted a General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) that became fully effective on May 25, 2018, imposing stringent EU data protection requirements.\nWe cannot yet fully determine the impact these or future laws, rules and regulations may have on our business or operations. These laws, rules and regulations may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, subject to differing interpretations and may be interpreted to conflict with our practices. Additionally, we may be bound by contractual requirements applicable to our collection, use, processing and disclosure of various types of data, including personal information, and may be bound by, or voluntarily comply with, self-regulatory or other industry standards relating to these matters.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, or with other obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, the expenditure of legal and other costs and of substantial time and resources, and fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such action would be expensive to defend, may require the expenditure of substantial legal and other costs and substantial time and resources and likely would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFurther, in view of new or modified federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, or any changes in their interpretation, we may find it necessary or desirable to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our product and otherwise adapt to these changes. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and features could be limited. Privacy, data protection and information security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit the use and growth of our online marketplace, particularly in certain foreign countries.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel on our executive team or to effectively manage leadership succession, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel on our executive team. Senior employees have left our company in the past and others may in the future. We often cannot anticipate such departures, and may not be able to promptly replace key leadership personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to promptly identify a suitable successor to a key role could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Julie Wainwright, has unique and valuable experience from creating and leading our company from its inception through today. If she were to depart or otherwise reduce her focus on The RealReal, our business may be disrupted.\nLabor-related matters, including labor disputes, may adversely affect our operations.\nNone of our employees are currently represented by a union. If our employees decide to form or affiliate with a union, we cannot predict the negative effects such future organizational activities will have on our business and operations. If we were to become subject to work stoppages, we could experience disruption in our operations, including delays in merchandising operations and shipping, and increases in our labor costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nExpansion of our operations internationally will require management attention and resources, involves additional risks and may be unsuccessful.\nWe have members from outside the United States who purchase items from our online marketplace, but we have not expanded our physical operations outside the United States. If we choose to expand our physical operations internationally, we would need to adapt to different local cultures, languages, standards, laws and regulations and policies. The online marketplace consignment business model we employ may not appeal to consignors and buyers outside of the United States. Furthermore, to succeed with clients in international locations, it will be necessary to locate merchandising and fulfillment facilities in foreign markets and hire local employees in those markets, and we may have to invest in such facilities before demonstrating that we can successfully run operations outside of the United States. We may not be successful in expanding into international markets or in generating revenue from foreign operations for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour failure to localize our luxury consignment business model, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local cultures and customs;\n\u2022\ndifferent buyer demand dynamics, which may make our model and the merchandise we offer less successful compared to the United States;\n\u2022\ncompetition from local firms that understand the local market and may operate more effectively;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, trade sanctions and economic embargoes, tariffs, export quotas, import laws and regulations, custom duties, shipping of pre-owned goods from or into the U.S. or other trade restrictions or any unexpected changes thereto;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States and increased labor costs;\n\u2022\nmore stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security and access to, or use of, commercial and personal information, particularly in Europe;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nrisks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to establish and expand our operations internationally and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our operating results would suffer.\nOur inability to replicate our business model for newer categories of consigned luxury goods in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur women\u2019s category accounted for approximately 66% of our GMV in 2019. We intend to deepen our penetration in other high-value categories such as men\u2019s, jewelry and watches, and home and art. We continue to explore additional categories of luxury goods to serve our existing consignors and buyers and to attract new consignors and buyers. These additional category offerings may not have the same success, or gain traction with consignors and buyers as quickly, as our women\u2019s offerings. If these additional categories of pre-owned luxury goods are not accepted by our existing consignors or buyers, or if such categories do not attract new consignors or buyers, our revenues may fall short of expectations, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected and we may incur expenses that are not offset by revenues. In addition, our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract new and repeat consignors that supply the necessary high-quality, appropriately priced and in-demand luxury merchandise in these additional categories, and these categories of goods may also have a different range of margin profiles than the goods currently sold through our online marketplace. Additionally, as we enter into new categories, potential consignors may demand higher commissions than our current categories, which would adversely affect our take rate and operating results. Expansion of our offerings may also strain our management and operational resources, specifically the need to hire and manage additional authentication and market experts. We may also face greater competition in specific categories from companies that are more focused on these categories. If any of these were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business, including our costs and supply of consigned goods, is subject to risks associated with sourcing, processing, warehousing and shipping.\nNearly all of the luxury goods we offer through our online marketplace are initially sourced from consignors who are individuals. As a result, we may be subject to periodic fluctuations in the number, brands and quality of goods sold through our online marketplace on behalf of our consignors. Our operating results could be negatively impacted by these fluctuations. In addition, as we expand into new categories of luxury goods, our payments to our consignors may rise relative to our existing categories, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe can make no assurance that goods we receive from consignors will be of sufficient quality or free from damage, or that such goods will not be damaged during shipping, while stored in one of our merchandising and fulfillment facilities or when shipped to buyers. While we take measures to avoid damage, conduct inspections of consigned goods and inspect returned products, we cannot control items while they are out of our possession or prevent all damage while in our merchandising and fulfillment facilities. For example, we have in the past and may in the future experience contamination, such as mold, bacteria, insects and other pests, in the goods shipped to us by our consignors, which may cause contamination of the goods stored in our merchandising and fulfillment facilities or while shipping to buyers. If we are unable to detect and quarantine such contaminants at the time such goods are initially received in our merchandising and fulfillment facilities, some or all of the goods stored in such facilities could be contaminated. We may incur additional expenses and our reputation could be harmed if clients and potential clients believe that the luxury goods we offer on behalf of our consignors is not of high-quality or may be damaged or contain contaminants.\nWe could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of consignors.\nWe may fail to prevent consignors from consigning stolen goods. Government regulators and law enforcement officials may allege that our services violate, or aid and abet violations of certain laws, including laws restricting or prohibiting the transferability and, by extension, the resale, of stolen goods. Our form of consignor agreement includes a representation that the consignor has the necessary right and title to the goods they may consign, and we include such a rule and requirement in our terms of service prohibiting the listing of stolen or otherwise illegal products. In addition, we have implemented other protective measures to detect such products. If these measures prove inadequate, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures which could negatively impact our operations. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of stolen goods could harm our business. In addition, negative publicity relating to the actual or perceived\nlisting or sale of stolen goods using our services could damage our reputation, and make our consignors and buyers reluctant to use our services. To the extent any of this occurs, it could harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face liability for such unlawful activities. Despite measures taken by us to detect stolen goods, to cooperate fully with law enforcement, and to respond to inquiries regarding potentially stolen goods, any resulting claims or liabilities could harm our business.\nShipping is a critical part of our business and any changes in our shipping arrangements or any interruptions in shipping could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe currently rely on major vendors for our shipping. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these vendors or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and our consignors\u2019 and buyers\u2019 experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound consignments efficiently and ship luxury goods to buyers may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism and similar factors. Because of the seasonality of our business, we tend to ship more goods in the fourth quarter than any other quarter. Disruption to delivery services due to winter weather in the fourth quarter could result in delays that could adversely affect our reputation or operational results. If our goods are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during the consignment or the delivery process, our consignors or buyers could become dissatisfied and cease using our services, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may incur significant losses from fraud.\nWe have in the past incurred and may in the future incur losses from various types of fraudulent transactions, including the use of stolen credit card numbers, claims that a consignment of a good was not authorized and that a buyer did not authorize a purchase. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if the fraud is related to credit card transactions and becomes excessive, it could result in us paying higher fees or losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. Under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder\u2019s signature. Our failure to adequately prevent fraudulent transactions could damage our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory action or lead to expenses that could substantially impact our operating results.\nUse of social media, emails and text messages may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nWe use social media, emails, push notifications and text messages as part of our omni-channel approach to marketing. As laws and regulations evolve to govern the use of these channels, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the use of these channels could adversely affect our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties. In addition, our employees or third parties acting at our direction may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that could lead to the loss or infringement of intellectual property, as well as the public disclosure of proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information of our business, employees, consumers or others. Information concerning us or our consignors and brands, whether accurate or not, may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may have an adverse impact on our brand, reputation or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses.\nWe rely on constant replenishment of consigned goods to sustain and grow our revenue, and our revenue in a given period can be difficult to predict. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions. A downturn in the United States or global economies may result in decreased consumer disposable income and decreased purchases. We make certain assumptions when planning our expenses based on our expected revenue. These assumptions are partly based on historical results. Because our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, any failure to achieve our revenue expectations would have a direct, adverse effect on our operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot successfully protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, contractual protections and other practices to protect our brand, proprietary information, technologies and processes. We primarily rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, including the algorithms we use throughout our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies and processes, or may improperly acquire and use information about our technologies and processes, which may allow them to provide a service similar to ours, which could harm our competitive position. Our principal trademark assets include the registered trademark \u201cThe RealReal\u201d and our logos and taglines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that support our brand and consumers\u2019 perception of our services and merchandise. We also hold the rights to the \u201ctherealreal.com\u201d Internet domain name and various related domain names, which are subject to Internet regulatory bodies and trademark and other related laws of each applicable jurisdiction. If we are unable to protect our trademarks or domain names, our brand recognition and reputation would suffer, we would incur significant expense establishing new brands and our operating results would be adversely impacted. Further, to the extent we pursue patent protection for our innovations, patents we may apply for may not issue, and patents that do issue or that we acquire may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. There can be no assurance that any patents we obtain will adequately protect our inventions or survive a legal challenge, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and the efforts we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient.\nWe could be required to pay or collect sales taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so, with respect to past or future sales. This could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAn increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers of goods. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States recently ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al (\u201cWayfair\u201d), that online sellers can be required to collect sales tax despite not having a physical presence in the state of the customer. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments and taxing authorities may adopt, or begin to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. While we collect and remit sales taxes in every state that requires sales taxes to be collected, including states where we do not have a physical presence, the adoption of new laws by, or a successful assertion by the taxing authorities of, one or more state or local governments requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently do collect some taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments and taxing authorities of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state ecommerce businesses could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors and decrease our future sales, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nApplication of existing tax laws, rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities.\nThe application of the income and tax laws is subject to interpretation. Although we believe our tax methodologies are compliant, a taxing authority\u2019s final determination in the event of a tax audit could materially differ from our past or current methods for determining and complying with our tax obligations, including the calculation of our tax provisions and accruals, in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties. Furthermore, taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation and enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations over time, as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues. This has contributed to an increase in audit activity and stricter enforcement by taxing authorities. As such, additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAmendments to existing tax laws, rules or regulations or enactment of new unfavorable tax laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMany of the underlying laws, rules and regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the Internet and ecommerce. U.S. federal, state and local taxing authorities are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce and considering changes to existing tax or other laws that could levy sales, income, consumption, use or other taxes relating to our activities, and/or impose obligations on us to collect such taxes. If such tax or other laws, rules or regulations are amended, or if new unfavorable laws, rules or regulations are enacted, the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations, prospectively or retrospectively, subject us to interest and penalties, decrease the demand for our services if we pass on such costs to our buyers or consignors, result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions. As a result, these changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRecently enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made a number of significant changes to the current U.S. federal income tax rules, including reducing the generally applicable corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposing additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, placing limits on the utilization of net operating losses and making substantial changes to the international tax rules. Many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act still require guidance through the issuance and/or finalization of regulations by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in order to fully assess their effect, and there may be substantial delays before such regulations are promulgated and/or finalized, increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on us and our stockholders. There also may be technical corrections legislation or other legislative changes proposed with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us or our stockholders.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), during our history. Unused NOLs may carry forward to offset future taxable income if we achieve profitability in the future, unless such NOLs expire under applicable tax laws. However, under the rules of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. The applicable rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company, as well as changes in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company. During 2019, we analyzed whether any of the reported net operating losses would be limited because of these rules. Based on our analysis we believe $3.3 million of the Federal and $2.1 million of California net operating losses will not be available to offset future taxable income because of the limitation. The reported net operating losses have been adjusted based on this analysis. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes certain limitations on the deduction of NOLs generated in tax years that began on or after January 1, 2018, including a limitation on use of NOLs to offset 80% of taxable income and the disallowance of NOL carryback. Although NOLs generated in tax years before 2018 may still be used to offset future income without limitation, the recent legislation may limit our ability to use our NOLs to offset any future taxable income.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders.\nWe intend to continue making investments to support our growth and may require additional funds to support this growth and respond to business challenges, including the need to develop our online marketplace services, expand our categories of pre-owned luxury goods, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand the markets in which we operate and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-\nraising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business and prospects could fail or be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), following the later of the date we are deemed to be an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d or a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d each as defined in the Exchange Act, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluations, document our controls and perform testing of our key controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may encounter difficulties in the timely and accurate reporting of our financial results, which would impact our ability to provide our investors with information in a timely manner. As a result, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and our stock price could decline.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\nIf you purchase shares of our common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the price you paid. We cannot assure you that the market price of our shares will equal or exceed prices in privately negotiated transactions of our shares that have occurred from time to time before our IPO. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our consignor or buyer base, the level of consignor and buyer engagement, revenue or other operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022\nany forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;\n\u2022\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nadditional shares of our common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales, including if existing stockholders sell shares into the market when the applicable \u201clock-up\u201d periods associated with our IPO ends;\n\u2022\nhedging activities by market participants;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of companies in our industry, including our competitors;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events or threats to public health, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many online marketplace and other technology companies\u2019 stock prices. Stock prices often fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. We have been the target of litigation associated with these fluctuations and market volatility and may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. See the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to lawsuits and other claims that are expensive and time consuming, could lead to adverse publicity, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\u201d\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers, like us, whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. The publication of such commentary has, and may in the future, cause a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. No assurances can be made that declines in the market price of our common stock will not occur in the future in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise.\nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us, or may cover us, were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nrestrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf under Delaware law, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by\nthe internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) or (5) any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim,\u201d as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL, in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. These exclusive-forum provisions do not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18784, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "REAL"}
