{"cik": "846913", "company": "FUEL TECH, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvestors in our Common Shares should be mindful of the following risk factors relative to our business.\nOur Product Portfolio Lacks Diversification\nWe have two broad technology segments that provide advanced engineering solutions to meet the pollution control, efficiency improvement, and operational optimization needs of coal-fired energy-related facilities worldwide. They are as follows:\n\u2022\nThe Air Pollution Control technology segment includes technologies to reduce NOx emissions in flue gas from boilers, incinerators, furnaces and other stationary combustion sources. These include Low and Ultra Low NOx Burners (LNB and ULNB), Over-Fire Air (OFA) systems, NOxOUT\u00ae and HERT\u2122 Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems, and Advanced Selective Catalytic Reduction (ASCR\u2122) systems. The ASCR system includes ULNB, OFA, and SNCR components, along with a downsized SCR catalyst, Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG), and Graduated Straightening Grid (GSG\u2122) systems to provide high NOx reductions at significantly lower capital and operating costs than conventional SCR systems. The NOxOUT CASCADE\u00ae and NOxOUT-SCR\u00ae processes are basic types of ASCR systems, using just SNCR and SCR catalyst components. ULTRA\u2122 technology creates ammonia at a plant site using safe urea for use with any SCR application. ESP technologies make use of electrostatic precipitator products and services to reduce particulate matter. Flue Gas Conditioning systems are chemical injection systems offered in markets outside the U.S. and Canada to enhance electrostatic precipitator and fabric filter performance in controlling particulate emissions.\n\u2022\nThe FUEL CHEM\u00ae technology segment which uses chemical processes in combination with advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Chemical Kinetics Modeling (CKM) boiler modeling for the control of slagging, fouling, corrosion, opacity and other sulfur trioxide-related issues in furnaces and boilers through the addition of chemicals into the furnace using TIFI\u00ae Targeted In-Furnace Injection\u2122 technology.\nAn adverse development in our advanced engineering solution business as a result of competition, technological change, government regulation, customers converting to use natural gas or other fuels, or any other factor could have a significantly greater impact than if we maintained more diverse operations.\nWe Face Substantial Competition\nCompetition in the Air Pollution Control market comes from competitors utilizing their own NOx reduction processes, including SNCR systems, Low NOx Burners, Over-Fire Air systems, flue gas recirculation, ammonia SNCR and SCR, which do not infringe our patented technologies. Indirect competition will also arise from business practices such as the purchase rather than the generation of electricity, fuel switching, closure or de-rating of units, and sale or trade of pollution credits and emission allowances. Utilization by customers of such processes or business practices or combinations thereof may adversely affect our pricing and participation in the NOx control market if customers elect to comply with regulations by methods other than the purchase of our Air Pollution Control products. See Item 1 \u201cProducts\u201d and \u201cNOx Reduction Competition\u201d in the Air Pollution Control segment overview.\nCompetition in the FUEL CHEM markets includes chemicals sold by specialty chemical and combustion engineering companies, such as NALCO (Ecolab), GE Infrastructure, and Environmental Energy Services, Inc.\nOur Business Is Dependent on Continuing Air Pollution Control Regulations and Enforcement\nOur business is significantly impacted by and dependent upon the regulatory environment surrounding the electricity generation market. Our business will be adversely impacted to the extent that regulations are repealed or amended to significantly reduce the level of required NOx reduction, or to the extent that regulatory authorities delay or otherwise minimize enforcement of existing laws. Additionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production which result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of fossil fuel-fired power plants may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1 above under the caption \u201cRegulations and Markets\u201d in the Air Pollution Control segment overview.\nWe May Not Be Able to Successfully Protect our Patents and Proprietary Rights\nWe hold licenses to or own a number of patents for our products and processes. In addition, we also have numerous patent applications pending both in the U.S. and abroad. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be granted or that our outstanding patents will not be challenged, overturned or otherwise circumvented by competitors. In foreign markets, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for our patent rights in emergi\nng markets. In addition, certain critical technical information relating to our products which is not patented is held as trade secret, and protected by trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure contained in our confidentiality and licensing agreements. There can be no assurance that such protections will prove adequate or that we will have adequate remedies against contractual counterparties for disclosure of our trade secrets or other violations of our intellectual property rights. See Item 1 above under the caption \u201cIntellectual Property.\u201d\nOur Results May Be Affected By Foreign Operations\nIn 2007, we expanded our operations in China by establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in Beijing. Our management believes that the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, offers significant market opportunities as nations in this region look to establish and implement regulatory policies for improving their environment and utilizing fossil fuels, especially coal, efficiently and effectively. In 2012, we expanded our operations in Latin and South America by establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in Chile. The future business opportunities in these markets are dependent on the continued implementation and enforcement of regulatory policies that will benefit our technologies, the acceptance of our engineering solutions in such markets, the ability of potential customers to utilize our technologies on a competitive, cost-effective basis, and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur Operating Results May Be Adversely Affected by Product Pricing\nThe onset of significant competition for either of the technology segments might require us to lower our product prices in order to remain competitive and have a corresponding adverse impact on our realized gross margins and operating profitability. See the risk factor entitled \u201cWe Face Substantial Competition\u201d above.\nWe May Not Be Able to Purchase Raw Materials on Commercially Advantageous Terms\nOur FUEL CHEM technology segment is dependent, in part, upon a supply of magnesium hydroxide. Any adverse changes in the availability of this chemical will likely have an adverse impact on ongoing operation of our FUEL CHEM programs. On March 4, 2009, we entered into a Restated Product Supply Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d) with Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, LLC (MMMS) in order to assure the continuance of a stable supply from MMMS of magnesium hydroxide products for our requirements in the United States and Canada. On October 31, 2013, we agreed to extend the term of the PSA to December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the PSA, MMMS supplies us with magnesium hydroxide products manufactured pursuant to our specifications and we have agreed to purchase from MMMS, and MMMS has agreed to supply, 100% of our requirements for such magnesium hydroxide products for our customers who purchase such products for delivery in the United States and Canada. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a stable source of magnesium hydroxide in markets outside the United States.\nOur Customer Base Is Highly Concentrated\nA small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. There can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders, that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods, or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers. The loss of one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nWe May Borrow Funds Pursuant to our Credit Facilities\nWe are party to a $15 million domestic revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility and Fuel Tech was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the agreement. In addition, our Chinese subsidiary, Beijing Fuel Tech Environmental Technologies Company, Ltd., has a RMB 35 million (approximately $5.688 million) revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank (China) Company Limited. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding borrowings under this facility were approximately $1,625. In the event of any default on our part under either of these agreements, the lender is entitled to accelerate payment of any amounts outstanding and may, under certain circumstances, cancel the facilities. If we were unable to obtain a waiver for a breach of covenant and the lender accelerated the payment of any outstanding amounts, such acceleration may cause our cash position to significantly deteriorate or, if cash on hand were insufficient to satisfy the payment due, may require us to obtain alternate financing.", "PERMNO": 79586, "SIC": 3569, "TIC": "FTEK"}
