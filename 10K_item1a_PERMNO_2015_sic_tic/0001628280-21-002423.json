{"cik": "1472595", "company": "R1 RCM INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers or acquire new customers, our financial condition will suffer.\nOur success depends in part upon the retention of our customers and our ability to acquire new customers. We derive our net services revenue primarily from managed services agreements pursuant to which we receive performance-based fees. Customers can elect not to renew their managed services agreements with us upon expiration. Our agreements with certain customers permit such customers to terminate for convenience, subject to a notice period. If a managed services agreement is not renewed or is terminated early for any reason, we would not derive the financial benefits that we would expect to derive by serving that customer. In addition, certain customer agreements contain clauses requiring us to offer fees for comparable services at least as low as the fees we offer other customers. If we offer new customers a lower fee, it may impact our ability to continue to be profitable while serving existing customers.\nSome of our managed services agreements require us to adhere to extensive, complex data security, network access, and other institutional procedures and requirements of our customers, and we cannot guarantee that some of our customers will not allege that we have not complied with all such procedures and requirements. If we breach a managed services agreement or, for certain of our managed services agreements, fail to perform in accordance with contractual service levels, we may be liable to the customer for damages, and either we or the customer may generally terminate an agreement for a material uncured breach by the other. In addition, financial issues or other changes in customer circumstances, such as a customer change in control (including as a result of increasing consolidation within the healthcare provider industry), may cause us or the customer to seek to modify or terminate a managed services agreement.\nIncreasing consolidation within the healthcare provider industry may also make it more difficult for us to acquire new customers, as consolidated healthcare systems may be more likely to have incumbent revenue cycle management providers or significant internal revenue cycle capabilities. For example, certain of our smaller customers have been acquired by larger healthcare systems and ceased to be customers.\nIf we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe have not always been fully successful in managing the expansion of our operations which has led, at times, to customer dissatisfaction and weaknesses in our operating, internal, and financial controls. To manage potential future growth, we will need to hire, integrate, and retain highly skilled and motivated employees, and will need to work effectively with a growing number of customer employees engaged in revenue cycle operations. We will also need to continue to maintain or improve our operating, internal, and financial controls, reporting systems, and procedures. If we do not effectively manage our operations, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, or maintain high-quality service offerings.\nThe markets for our RCM service offering may develop more slowly than we expect.\nOur success depends, in part, on the willingness of healthcare organizations to implement integrated solutions for the areas in which we provide services. Some organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to implement our solutions for a number of reasons, including failure to perceive the need for improved revenue cycle operations, lack of knowledge about the potential benefits our solutions provide, or having made or be planning to make investments in internally developed solutions and choosing to continue to rely on their own internal resources.\nWe may not be able to maintain profitability.\nPrior to 2019, we had incurred net losses in most of our recent fiscal years in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We also incurred significant costs in most of our recent fiscal years including, among other things, costs related to acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, debt related fees and expenses, restructuring, and/or previously settled lawsuits filed against us and we may continue to incur additional costs in connection with certain of these matters. Further, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs for investments in technology, facilities, and talent to support the anticipated growth of our business, including growth related to the expected implementation of our services under our operating partner relationships. We intend to continue to increase our operating expenses associated with sales and marketing in future years in an effort to expand our business. If our revenue does not increase to offset these increases in costs, our operating results would be adversely affected. You should not consider our historical operating results as indicative of future operating results, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain profitability in the future. Each of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as other factors, may adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe face a selling cycle of variable length to secure new RCM agreements, making it difficult to predict the timing of specific new customer relationships.\nWe face a selling cycle of variable length, typically spanning six to 18 months or longer, to secure a new managed services agreement. Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in entering into a managed services agreement with that customer. In addition, we cannot accurately predict the timing of entering into managed services agreements with new customers due to the complex procurement decision processes of most healthcare providers, which often involves high-level management or board committee approvals. Due to our variable selling cycle length, we have only a limited ability to predict the timing of specific new customer relationships, which affects our ability to predict future cash flows. In periods which we add new customers, our operating costs are typically higher because we incur expenses to implement our operating model at those customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than we do, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, growth rates and market share.\nThe market for our solutions is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. The rapid changes in the U.S. healthcare market due to financial pressures to reduce the growth in healthcare costs and from regulatory and legislative initiatives are increasing the level of competition. We face competition from new entrants, internal RCM departments, and external participants. External participants that are our competitors include end-to-end RCM providers, software vendors and other technology-supported RCM business process outsourcing companies, traditional consultants, and information technology outsourcers. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulations, or customer requirements. We may not be able to compete successfully with these companies, and these or other competitors may introduce technologies or services that render our technologies or services obsolete or less marketable. Even if our technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of our competitors, current or potential customers might prefer competitive solutions to our solutions. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could adversely affect our margins, growth rate, or market share. Even if we have a good relationship and strong performance history with the customer, open and competitive biding practices mean we may not be awarded the renewal business or may have to aggressively price our services to be successful.\nIf our information technology security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers may be reduced, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information and protected health, financial, payment, and other personal information of patients. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of such information. Due to the sensitivity of this information, the effectiveness of such security efforts is very important. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to customer or patient data. Improper activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries, and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Our security measures may not be effective in preventing these types of activities, and the information technology security measures of our third-party data centers and service providers may not be adequate.\nTo date, cyber attacks have not had a material impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition; however, we could suffer material losses in the future as a result of cyber attacks, and we are not able to predict the severity of these attacks. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the ongoing shortage of qualified cyber security professionals, and the interconnectivity and interdependence of third parties to our systems. The occurrence of a cyber attack, breach, unauthorized access, misuse, computer virus or other malicious code, or other cyber security event could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure, gathering, monitoring, misuse, corruption, loss, or destruction of confidential information that belongs to us or our customers or PHI that is processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. The occurrence of such an event could also result in damage to our software, computers, or systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, or third parties\u2019 operations. If a breach of our information technology security occurs, we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, possible lawsuits by individuals affected by the breach, and significant remediation costs and efforts to prevent future occurrences. Although we currently carry insurance coverage to protect ourselves against some of these risks, our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs could also have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, whether there is an actual or a perceived breach of our information technology security, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose current or potential customers.\nDelayed or unsuccessful implementation of our technologies or services with our customers or implementation costs that exceed our expectations may harm our financial results.\nTo implement our solutions, we work with our customer\u2019s existing vendors, management, and staff and layer our proprietary technology applications on top of the customer\u2019s existing patient accounting and clinical systems. Each customer\u2019s situation is different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise, such as delays in, or the inability to, obtain approvals or access rights from our customers' vendors. If the implementation process is not executed successfully or is delayed, our relationship with the customer may be adversely affected and our results of operations could suffer. Implementation of our solutions also requires us to integrate our own employees into the customer\u2019s operations. Individual customer\u2019s circumstances or a combination of customer\u2019s circumstances may require us to devote a larger number of our employees than anticipated, which could increase our costs and harm our financial results.\nDisruptions in service or damage to our global business services centers and third-party operated data centers could adversely affect our business.\nOur global business services centers and third-party operated data centers are essential to our business. Our operations depend on our ability to operate our global business services centers and maintain and protect our applications, which are located in data centers that are operated for us by third parties. We cannot control or assure the continued or uninterrupted availability of these third-party data centers. In addition, our information technologies and systems, as well as our data centers and global business services centers, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes, including (1) acts of God and other natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, and\npandemics and other public health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) power losses, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses of and corruption of data, and similar events. We have a business continuity plan and maintain insurance against fires, floods, other natural disasters, and general business interruptions to mitigate the adverse effects of a disruption, relocation, or change in operating environment at one of our data centers or global business services centers, but the situations we plan for and the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate in every particular case. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, or cessations in service to our customers, or in interruptions, delays, or cessations in the direct connections we establish between our customers and payers. Any of these events could impair or inhibit our ability to provide our services, reduce the attractiveness of our services to current or potential customers, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure, data centers, global business services centers, or systems that we interface with, including the internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, improper employee or contractor access, programming errors, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, or other information security threats by third parties seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security. Any of these can cause system failure, including network, software, or hardware failure, which can result in service disruptions. As a result, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.\nOur growing global business services operations expose us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our costs of operations.\nOur reliance on an international workforce exposes us to disruptions in the business, political, and economic environment in those regions. Maintenance of a stable political environment is important to our operations, and terrorist attacks and acts of violence or war may directly affect our physical facilities and workforce or contribute to general instability. Our global business services operations require us to comply with local laws and regulatory requirements, which are complex and of which we may not always be aware, and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our global business services operations may also subject us to trade restrictions, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, security breaches, pandemics and other public health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors that may adversely affect our business. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and will likely continue to negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOn March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to the pandemic, governments around the world have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. Restrictions on businesses and travel are occurring based on state and local guidelines and vary by locality and cannot be reasonably predicted. Even after re-openings, a resurgence of cases have led to and may continue to lead to further shut-downs or restrictions after the initial re-opening. These measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers. These impacts include decreases in patient volumes, the need for personal protective equipment and other protective measures for front-line employees, and work-from-home arrangements. Restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to travel could affect our ability to sell or onboard certain services. Our business, along with the global economy, has been adversely affected by these measures, which have resulted in a significant reductions in spending, volatile economic conditions, and business disruptions across markets globally.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the adverse impacts to our results of operations which resulted from certain revenue pressure due to declining volumes were partially offset by our cost control initiatives which were implemented in 2020. However, due to the continued global spread of COVID-19, including throughout the U.S., we anticipate adverse effects on our results of operations throughout our business as our customers continue to\nexperience disruptions to their businesses. In response to governmental restrictions and/or concerns regarding the spread of the virus, many patients and/or providers have delayed or cancelled routine and non-essential medical procedures and physician visits. As a result, a number of our customers have a reduced need for our personnel on site to manage their RCM activities. However, even with decreased patient volumes, we have continued to employ our full customer-facing workforce. We also have a large number of employees now working from home, and such arrangements may involve increased use of public Wi-Fi and use of office equipment off premises, which may make our business more vulnerable to cybersecurity breach attempts. This period of uncertainty could also lead to an increase in phishing and other scams, fraud, theft, or other criminal activity. In addition, we have a significant number of personnel internationally, including in India, which has implemented strict travel restrictions across the country. Travel restrictions or other containment measures or the sudden spread of COVID-19 in India or in any other country where we have a large number of personnel or critical operations could impair our ability to manage day-to-day service delivery for our customers, which could result in, among other things, losses of revenue or breaches of our customer contracts if a large number of personnel were unable to work at the same time. Further, adverse impacts to our customers\u2019 businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause delays in, or limit their ability to, make timely payments to us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it have caused an economic slowdown. An economic slowdown, recession, or economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could negatively affect us by reducing patient or service volumes and payment ability. The extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, but could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and liquidity in future periods. The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which can increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our ability to access capital.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, business closures or business disruption, and the actions taken throughout the world, including in our markets, to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. The severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing, and difficult to predict and depends on events beyond our knowledge or control. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. The agreement that governs our indebtedness contains covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to operate.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of our strategic initiatives. The loan agreement for this indebtedness contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative financial covenants, indemnity obligations, and events of default. These covenants could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022negative financial covenants contained in the debt agreement require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022our debt level will make us more vulnerable than our less leveraged competitors to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to comply with the provisions of the debt agreement may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations.\nIf we lose key personnel or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate, and retain our key personnel and other necessary employees, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate, and retain key personnel. Our future success also depends in part on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel, each of whom may be difficult to replace. The loss of services of any of our executive officers or key personnel, or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Competition for the caliber and number of employees we require is intense. We may face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training each of our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. Under the terms of our operating partner model agreements, we expect to transition a significant number of our customers\u2019 revenue cycle management employees to our employment. We may experience difficulties in integrating and retaining these employees. We employ a significant number of personnel internationally and expect to continue to add personnel in India. Significant growth in the technology sector in India has increased competition to attract and retain skilled employees and has led to a commensurate increase in compensation expense. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring, integrating, and training their replacements, and the quality of our services and our ability to serve our customers could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be liable to our customers or third parties if we make errors in providing our services, and our anticipated net services revenue may be lower if we provide poor service.\nThe services we offer are complex, and we make errors from time to time. Errors can result from the interface of our proprietary technology applications and a customer\u2019s existing technologies or we may make human errors in any aspect of our service offerings. The costs incurred in correcting any material errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. Our customers, or third parties such as our customers\u2019 patients, may assert claims against us alleging that they suffered damages due to our errors, and such claims could subject us to significant legal defense costs in excess of our existing insurance coverage and adverse publicity regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such claims. In addition, if we provide poor service to a customer and the customer therefore fails to achieve agreed upon improvement in financial or operating metrics, the incentive fee payments to us from that customer will be lower than anticipated.\nOur business operations currently include the collection, on behalf of our customers, of medical co-pays and other payments that are due to our customers from their patients. This business practice has been perceived negatively by the public and this negative perception has adversely affected (and may continue to adversely affect) our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe currently collect, on behalf of our customers, medical co-pays and other non-defaulted payments that are due to our customers from their patients, pursuant to managed services agreements with our customers. Collection of these payments from patients may become a more significant part of our RCM services as industry trends continue to increase patient responsibility as a percentage of total compensation to healthcare providers. This business practice, which has received widespread, unfavorable publicity as a result of lawsuits previously initiated against us, has been negatively perceived by the public and has led us to change aspects of our business practices, made it more difficult to retain existing customers and attract new customers, extended the time it takes to enter into service agreements with new customers, and resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and it may continue to do so.\nNegative public perception in the United States regarding offshore outsourcing and proposed legislation may increase the cost of delivering our services.\nOffshore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the United States. For example, various organizations and public figures in the United States have expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the United States. Current or prospective customers may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services from onshore to offshore providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore provider. Any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends towards offshore outsourcing would increase the cost of delivering our services if we had to relocate aspects of our services from our global business services operations to the United States where operating costs are higher.\nLegislation in the United States may be enacted that is intended to discourage or restrict offshore outsourcing. In the United States, federal and state legislation has been proposed, and in several states enacted, to restrict or discourage U.S. companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the United States. Further, through rule making or executive action, some states have imposed limitations on offshore outsourcing of administrative services for the Medicaid program. It is possible that additional legislation could be adopted or regulatory guidance issued that would restrict U.S. private sector companies that have federal or state government contracts, or that receive government funding or reimbursement, such as Medicare or Medicaid payments, from outsourcing their services to offshore service providers. Any changes to existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing in the United States may adversely affect our ability to do business, particularly if these changes are widespread, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nLitigation has materially adversely affected our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows and caused unfavorable publicity and may continue to do so.\nWe are subject to, and may in the future become subject to additional, lawsuits, claims, audits, and investigations related to our business. Current lawsuits, claims, audits, and investigations are described in \u201cPart I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d. These, as well as any future lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, have resulted in, and may lead to additional, unfavorable publicity for us and may continue to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows in various ways, including subjecting us to significant liability, resulting in significant settlement payments, or having a disruptive effect upon the operation of our business and consuming the time and attention of our senior management. In addition, we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with these litigation matters, including substantial fees for attorneys. Although we maintain insurance that may provide coverage for some or all of these expenses, and we have given notice to our insurers of the claims, our insurers have responded, in many instances, by reserving their rights under the policies, including the rights to deny coverage under various policy exclusions. There is risk that the insurers will rescind the policies, that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such policies, or that, even if covered, our ultimate liability will exceed the available insurance.\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of pending legal actions. The ultimate resolutions of our pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, financial condition or liquidity, and on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe imposition of legal responsibility for obligations related to our customers\u2019 employees could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nUnder our co-management model, we work with customers\u2019 employees engaged in the activities included in the scope of our services. Our co-management model agreements establish the division of responsibilities between us and our customers for various personnel management matters, including compliance with and liability under various employment laws and regulations. We could, nevertheless, be found to have liability with our customers for actions against or by employees of our customers, including under various employment laws and regulations, such as those relating to discrimination, retaliation, wage and hour matters, occupational safety and health, family and medical leave, notice of facility closings and layoffs and labor relations, and any such liability could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe offer our services in many jurisdictions and, therefore, may be subject to federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that could harm our business or that we may have inadvertently failed to pay.\nWe may lose sales or incur significant costs should various tax jurisdictions be successful in imposing taxes on a broader range of services. Imposition of such taxes on our services could result in substantial unplanned costs, which would effectively increase the cost of such services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nRisks Related to Ascension and the Transaction\nHealthcare providers affiliated with Ascension currently account for a significant portion of our net services revenue. The early termination of our A&R MPSA with Ascension, or any significant loss of business from our large customers, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHealthcare providers affiliated with Ascension have accounted for a significant portion of our net services revenue each year since our formation. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, net services revenue from healthcare providers affiliated with Ascension represented 64%, 67%, and 69% of our total net services revenue, respectively. The early termination of the A&R MPSA, the loss of any of our other large customers or their failure to renew their managed services agreements with us upon expiration, or a reduction in the fees for our services for these customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur agreement with Ascension requires us to offer to Ascension service fees that are at least as low as the fees we charge any other customer receiving comparable services at comparable or lower volumes.\nOur A&R MPSA with Ascension requires us to offer to Ascension's affiliated healthcare providers fees for our services that are at least as low as the fees we charge any other customer receiving comparable services at lower volumes. If we were to charge lower service fees to any other customer receiving comparable services at lower volumes, we would be obligated to charge such lower fees to the hospital systems affiliated with Ascension effective as of the date such lower charges were first implemented for such other customer. If we offer customers lower rates as discussed above, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Investor, an affiliate of TowerBrook and Ascension, is a significant shareholder in us and may have conflicts of interest with us or other stockholders in the future.\nOn January 15, 2021, the Investor converted all of its 294,266 shares (the \u201cCurrent Shares\u201d) of Preferred Stock into 117,706,400 shares of common stock of the Company into which the Current Shares were convertible pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of the Preferred Stock, and, in consideration therefor, the Company (i) issued 21,582,800 additional shares of common stock, and (ii) paid the Investor $105.0 million in cash. The shares issued to the Investor represent 53% of the voting power of our stockholders as of February 11, 2021. The Investor also owns a warrant to acquire up to 60 million shares of our common stock which was issued pursuant to the Transaction. As a result of this ownership, so long as certain ownership thresholds are met, the Investor, among other things, has the right to nominate a majority of the members of our board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and has a consent right over certain corporate actions, including any amendment of the A&R MPSA, the incurrence of indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million, the acquisition of any assets or properties in excess of $100.0 million or the making of any capital expenditures in excess of $25.0 million, the approval of our annual budget, and the hiring or termination of our chief executive officer.\nThe interests of the Investor and its affiliates may differ from our other stockholders in material respects. For example, the Investor may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to other stockholders. Additionally, Ascension is an affiliate of the Investor and as our largest customer their interests may differ from other stockholders\u2019 interests. The Investor or its affiliates or advisors are also in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, and may from time to time in the future, acquire interests in, or\nprovide advice to, businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. They may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Other stockholders should consider that the interests of the Investor and its affiliates may differ from theirs in material respects.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe may fail to realize the success of strategic initiatives and other investments.\nThe anticipated benefits of acquisitions, strategic initiatives, and other investments will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated synergies, cost savings, and operational benefits of corresponding activity, which benefits are subject to, among others, the following risks:\n\u2022the incurrence of additional indebtedness in connection with the financing of the acquisition may have an adverse effect on our liquidity;\n\u2022we may fail to retain key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022we may be unable to successfully integrate personnel from acquired companies, while at the same time attempting to provide consistent, high quality services;\n\u2022we may fail to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings we expect from the acquisition;\n\u2022future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022we may face difficulties establishing, integrating, or combining operations and systems;\n\u2022we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022we may encounter unforeseen internal control, regulatory or compliance issues; and\n\u2022we may face other additional risks relating to regulatory matters, legal proceedings, or tax laws or positions.\nIf any of these risks occur, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or they may take longer to realize than expected. The integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business, or inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, procedures, and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the services we provide. There can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or adversely affected by enforcement initiatives. Our failure to anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business, or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect the attractiveness of our services to existing customers and our ability to market new services. We are unable to predict what changes to laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or our operating costs.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry, including national healthcare reform, could adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect this to continue. We are unable to predict each healthcare initiative that will be implemented at the federal or state level, or what the ultimate\neffect these initiatives may have on us. For example, changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are implemented periodically and may cause a reduction in the amounts received by our customers and may have an adverse indirect effect on our business.\nIn addition, healthcare reform is causing some payors to transition from volume to value-based reimbursement models, which can include risk-sharing, bundled payment, and other innovative approaches. While these models may provide us with opportunities to provide new or additional services (e.g., our value based reimbursement capabilities within our RCM service offering) and to participate in incentive-based payment arrangements, there can be no assurance that such new models and approaches will prove to be profitable to our customers or us. Further, new models and approaches may require investment by us to develop technology or expertise to offer necessary and appropriate services or support to our customers, and the amount of such investment and the timing for return of such investment are not fully known at this time. In addition, some of these new models are being offered as pilot programs and there is no assurance that they will continue or be renewed. Further, adoption of such new models and approaches may require compliance with a range of federal and state laws relating to fraud and abuse, insurance, reinsurance and managed care regulation, billing and collection, corporate practice of medicine restrictions, and licensing, among others. Many states in which these new value-based structures are being developed lack regulatory guidance or a well-developed body of law for these new models and approaches, or may not have updated their laws or enacted legislation yet to reflect the new healthcare reform models. As a result, although we have structured, and will attempt to structure and conduct, our operations in accordance with our interpretation of current laws and regulations, new and existing laws, regulations, or guidance could have a material adverse effect on our current and future operations and could subject us to the risk of restructuring or terminating our customer agreements and arrangements, as well as the risk of regulatory enforcement, penalties, and sanctions, if state enforcement agencies disagree with our interpretation of state laws.\nIf we violate HIPAA, the HITECH Act or state or foreign health information privacy laws, we may incur significant liabilities, and any such violations could make it more difficult to retain existing customers or attract new customers, extend the time it takes to enter into service agreements with new customers, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs described in Item 1 above, HIPAA contains substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals\u2019 PHI. Since the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009, enforcement of HIPAA violations has increased, as indicated by the announcement of a number of significant settlement agreements and/or sanctions by federal authorities, the pursuit of HIPAA violations by state attorneys general, and the roll-out of a new federal audit program for covered entities and business associates. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general may bring civil actions in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations and/or state privacy and security laws that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nWe and our customers also are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties and subject us to additional privacy and security restrictions. Legislation has also been proposed or implemented at various times at both the federal and the state levels that would limit, forbid or regulate the use or transmission of medical information pertaining to U.S. patients outside of the United States. In addition, various states recently have enacted, and other states are considering, new laws and regulations concerning the privacy and security of consumer and other personal information. To the extent we are subject to such requirements, these laws and regulations often have far-reaching effects, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply, and may render our international operations impracticable or make them substantially more expensive. These laws and regulations often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, which may increase the likelihood or impact of data breach litigation.\nAlong with state and federal laws, GDPR imposes obligations on us as a data controller and data processor, as well as on many of our customers. New privacy laws also may mandate steps needed to continue to store, transfer, and process personal data. For example, there are some legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. This may mean that data transfer agreements will need to be updated. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency.\nWe have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any security incidents or breaches. We have received and maintained certification from the Health Information Trust (HITRUST) Alliance since January 2013. The HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF), the most widely adopted framework in the healthcare industry, provides a comprehensive set of baseline security controls that leverage nationally and internationally accepted standards, including ISO, NIST, PCI, HIPAA and COBIT. Our HITRUST certification validates our continued commitment to compliance with the Security and Privacy Rules under HIPAA and to state-specific security and privacy laws regarding the creation, access, storage or exchange of PHI and financial information. Nonetheless, a knowing breach of HIPAA\u2019s requirements could expose us to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes that is not due to reasonable cause or involves willful neglect could expose us to significant civil penalties and the possibility of civil litigation under HIPAA and applicable state law.\nIn addition, given the omnipresent threat of potential cybersecurity incidents or security breaches, we, or our customers, could be required to report such breaches to affected consumers or regulatory authorities, leading to disclosures that could damage our reputation or harm our business, financial position, and operating results. We have been the victim of theft of company property containing patient data in the past, and we may face similar incidents in the future. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted many employees to work from home environments, which introduces additional risk surrounding theft of company property and access to PHI. Cybersecurity incidents or allegations of deficiencies regarding our data security practices could require us to change aspects of our business practices, make it more difficult to retain existing customers or attract new customers, extend the time it takes to enter into service agreements with new customers, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state laws governing submission of false or fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs and financial relationships among healthcare providers, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs.\nHealthcare is one of the largest industries in the country and one of the costliest lines in the federal budget. As a result, the health care industry continues to attract attention from legislators and regulators. As described in Item 1 above, a number of health care fraud and abuse laws, including but not limited to the AKS, FCA, Stark Law, and EMTALA, and their state counterparts, apply to hospitals, physicians, and others who furnish health care services to patients and submit claims for reimbursement to government programs and/or commercial insurers, and refer patients to one another, continues to attract attention from legislators and regulators. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to focus on enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other healthcare reimbursement laws and rules in an effort to reduce overall healthcare spending.\nThese laws are complex, may change rapidly, and their application to our specific services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways we do not anticipate. New payment structures, for example, such as accountable care organizations and other arrangements involving combinations of healthcare providers who share savings, potentially implicate anti-kickback and other fraud and abuse laws. In addition, errors created by our proprietary applications or services that relate to entry, formatting, preparation, or transmission of claims, reporting of quality or other data pursuant to value-based purchasing initiatives, or cost report information may be alleged or determined to cause the submission of false claims or otherwise be in violation of these laws. Further, the continued growth of our coding and billing services provided from a global business services\nenvironment necessitates comprehensive monitoring and oversight of these services to ensure a constant vigilance to quality control and regulatory compliance.\nWhile we seek to structure our business relationships and activities to avoid any activity that could be construed to implicate federal and state fraud and abuse laws, we cannot assure you that our arrangements and activities will be deemed outside the scope of these laws or that increased enforcement activities will not directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any determination that we have violated any of these laws could, for example (i) subject us to civil or criminal penalties (ii) require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business (iii) disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs, (iv) give our customers the right to terminate our managed services agreements with them, and/or (v) require us to refund portions of our base fee revenues and incentive payment revenues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, any violations by, and resulting penalties or exclusions imposed upon, our customers could adversely affect their financial condition and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Finally, even absent an alleged violation of the law by us, participants in the healthcare industry receive inquiries or subpoenas to produce documents in connection with government investigations. We could be required to expend significant time and resources to comply with these requests, and the attention of our management team could be diverted by these efforts.\nWe cannot be certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing EMTALA, or other parties, will not assert that our customers are in violation of EMTALA, and defending and settling allegations of EMTALA violations could have a material adverse effect on our business even if we are ultimately not found to have contributed to such violations.\nAlthough EMTALA is not directly applicable to us because we are not a Medicare participating hospital, we cannot be certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing EMTALA, or other parties, will not assert that our customers are in violation of EMTALA. If our customers are found to have violated EMTALA, they may assert claims that our management practices contributed to the violation. Defending and settling allegations of EMTALA violations could have a material adverse effect on our business even if we are ultimately not found guilty of a violation.\nOur failure to comply with debt collection and other consumer protection laws and regulations could subject us to fines and other liabilities, which could harm our reputation and business, and could make it more difficult to retain existing customers or attract new customers, extend the time it takes to enter into service agreements with new customers, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business practices involve collecting or assisting our customers in collecting, non-defaulted amounts owed by patients for current and prior services activities, which may subject us to the FDCPA. The FDCPA and the TCPA restrict the methods that we may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. Moreover, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. We could incur costs or could be subject to fines or other penalties under the TCPA, the FDCPA and the FTC Act if we are determined to have violated the provisions of those regulations during the course of conducting our operations. Any perceived breach of the FDCPA could result in us being required to change aspects of our business practices, make it more difficult to retain existing customers or attract new customers, extend the time it takes to enter into service agreements with new customers, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. If we fail to establish or protect our intellectual property rights, we may lose an important advantage in the market in which we compete. We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law and contractual terms and conditions to protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to protect our competitive advantages. We cannot assure you that any patents issued or that will be issued from current or future applications will provide us with the protection that we seek or that any current or future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patents are uncertain. Also, we cannot assure you that any trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any of our trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe also rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets may lose their value if not properly protected. We endeavor to enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers, contractors, and business partners to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and proprietary technology. Moreover, others may reverse engineer or independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property and using our technology for their competitive advantage. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Monitoring infringement of our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly, and enforcement of our intellectual property rights may require us to bring legal actions against infringers. Infringement actions are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, and even if successful, may require a substantial amount of resources and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could force us to incur significant costs or revise the way we conduct our business.\nOur competitors protect their intellectual property rights by means such as patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks. We have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties. Additionally, because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are kept confidential for 18 months before they are published, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our proprietary technology. Any party asserting that we infringe its proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves, and possibly our customers, against the alleged infringement. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could: subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights; cause interruption or cessation of our operations; require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties; and consume time which would otherwise be spent on our core business. Even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could deplete our financial resources. Furthermore, during the course of litigation, confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions, or trial testimony. The software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, the risk of such a lawsuit will likely increase as our size and scope of our services and technology platforms increase, as our geographic presence and market share expand and as the number of competitors in our market increases. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Shares of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile.\nSince December 31, 2010, our common stock has traded at a price per share as high as $32.82 and as low as $1.47. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. In addition to the risks described in this section, factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in estimates of our financial results;\n\u2022failure to meet expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022the loss of service agreements with customers;\n\u2022lawsuits filed against us by governmental authorities or stockholders;\n\u2022unfavorable publicity concerning our operations or business practices;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of us; and\n\u2022changes in general economic, industry, regulatory, and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022require that directors only be removed from office upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our Board, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022limit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022require supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nWe may not pay any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough we paid cash dividends on our capital stock prior to our May 2010 initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) there is no assurance that we will pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, contractual restrictions, provisions of applicable law, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93369, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "RCM"}
