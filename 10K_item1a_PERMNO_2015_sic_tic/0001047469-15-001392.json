{"cik": "1289460", "company": "Texas Roadhouse, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business.\nSeasonality\nOur business is also subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each year. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be\nexpected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease.\nEmployees\nAs of December 30, 2014, we employed approximately 43,300 people in the company restaurants we own and operate and our corporate support center. This amount includes 508 executive and administrative personnel and 1,713 restaurant management personnel, while the remainder were hourly restaurant personnel. Many of our hourly restaurant employees work part-time. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\nExecutive Officers of the Company\nSet forth below are the name, age, position and a brief account of the business experience of each of our executive officers:\nW. Kent Taylor. Mr. Taylor is the founder of Texas Roadhouse and resumed his role as Chief Executive Officer in August 2011, a position he held between May 2000 and October 2004. He was named Chairman of the Company and Board in October 2004. Before his founding of our concept, Mr. Taylor founded and co-owned Buckhead Bar and Grill in Louisville, Kentucky. Mr. Taylor has over 30 years of experience in the restaurant industry.\nScott M. Colosi. Mr. Colosi was appointed President in August 2011 and has served as Chief Financial Officer since January 2015. Previously, Mr. Colosi served as our Chief Financial Officer from September 2002 to August 2011. From 1992 until September 2002, Mr. Colosi was employed by YUM! Brands, Inc., owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands. During this time, Mr. Colosi served in various financial positions and, immediately prior to joining us, was Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Colosi has over 25 years of experience in the restaurant industry.\nCelia P. Catlett. Ms. Catlett was appointed General Counsel in November 2013. She joined Texas Roadhouse in 2005 and served as Associate General Counsel from 2010 until her appointment as General Counsel. She has served as Corporate Secretary since 2011. Prior to joining us, Ms. Catlett practiced law in New York City. Ms. Catlett has 14 years of legal experience, including over 9 years of experience in the restaurant industry.\nWebsite Access to Reports\nWe make our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available, free of charge on or through the Internet website, www.texasroadhouse.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFrom time to time, in periodic reports and oral statements and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we present statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future financial and operating performance and growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements.\nCareful consideration should be given to the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, it could harm our business.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business. We have grown significantly since our inception and intend to continue growing in the future. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nYou should not rely on past changes in our average unit volume or our comparable restaurant sales as an indication of our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly.\nA number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales, including, among other factors:\n\u2022 consumer awareness and understanding of our brands;\n\u2022 our ability to execute our business strategy effectively;\n\u2022 unusually strong initial sales performance by new restaurants;\n\u2022 competition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry or our own restaurants;\n\u2022 weather and acts of God;\n\u2022 consumer trends;\n\u2022 introduction of new menu items;\n\u2022 negative publicity regarding food safety, health concerns, quality of service, and other food or beverage related matters, including the integrity of our or our suppliers' food processing; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions, which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use.\nOur average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales may not increase at rates achieved in the past. Changes in our average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur growth strategy, which primarily depends on our ability to open new restaurants that are profitable, is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur objective is to grow our business and increase stockholder value by (1) expanding our base of company restaurants (and, to a lesser extent, franchise restaurants) that are profitable and (2) increasing sales and profits at existing restaurants. While both these methods of achieving our objective are important to us, historically the most significant means of achieving our objective has been through opening new restaurants and operating these restaurants on a profitable basis. We expect this to continue to be the case for the near future.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to open new restaurants in accordance with our expansion plans. We have experienced delays in opening some of our restaurants in the past and may experience delays in the future. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially adversely affect our growth strategy. One of our biggest challenges in executing our growth strategy is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites. Competition for suitable restaurant sites in our target markets is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find sufficient suitable locations, or suitable purchase or lease terms, for planned expansion in any future period. Our ability to open new restaurants will also depend on numerous other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 our ability to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel, especially market partners and managing partners;\n\u2022 the availability of construction materials and labor;\n\u2022 our ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants;\n\u2022 our ability to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022 our ability to secure liquor licenses;\n\u2022 general economic conditions;\n\u2022 the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses; and\n\u2022 weather and acts of God.\nOnce opened, we anticipate that our new restaurants will generally take several months to reach planned operating levels due to start-up inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants. We cannot assure you that any restaurant we open will be profitable or obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Our ability to operate new restaurants profitably will depend on numerous factors, including those discussed above impacting our average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 competition from competitors in our industry or our own restaurants;\n\u2022 consumer acceptance of our restaurants in new domestic or international markets;\n\u2022 the ability of the market partner and the managing partner to execute our business strategy at the new restaurant;\n\u2022 general economic conditions which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs, and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use;\n\u2022 changes in government regulation;\n\u2022 road construction and other factors limiting access to the restaurant; and\n\u2022 weather and acts of God.\nOur failure to successfully open new restaurants that are profitable in accordance with our growth strategy could harm our business and future prospects. In addition, our inability to open new restaurants and provide growth opportunities to our employees could result in the significant loss of qualified personnel which could harm our business and future prospects.\nOur objective to increase sales and profits at existing restaurants could be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nDuring 2015 and possibly beyond, the U.S. and global economies may suffer from a downturn in economic activity. Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits could adversely affect the demand for our products. As in the past, we could experience reduced guest traffic or we may be unable or unwilling to increase the prices we can charge for our products to offset higher costs or fewer transactions, either of which could reduce our sales and profit margins. Also, landlords or other tenants in the shopping centers in which some of our restaurants are located may experience difficulty as a result of macroeconomic trends or cease to operate, which could in turn negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nOur franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with Texas Roadhouse standards. We also provide training and support to franchisees. However, most franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and these franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, the Texas Roadhouse image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022 the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses;\n\u2022 restaurant operating costs for our newly-opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter;\n\u2022 labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel including mandated changes in federal and/or state minimum and tip wage rates, state unemployment tax rates, or health benefits;\n\u2022 profitability of our restaurants, particularly in new markets;\n\u2022 changes in interest rates;\n\u2022 the impact of litigation, including negative publicity;\n\u2022 increases and decreases in average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales;\n\u2022 impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and any loss on restaurant closures;\n\u2022 general economic conditions which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs, and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use;\n\u2022 negative publicity regarding food safety, health concerns and other food and beverage related matters, including the integrity of our or our suppliers' food processing;\n\u2022 negative publicity relating to the consumption of beef or other products we serve;\n\u2022 changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u2022 expansion to new domestic or international markets;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions which impact guest traffic at our restaurants;\n\u2022 increases in infrastructure costs;\n\u2022 adoption of new, or changes in existing, accounting policies or practices;\n\u2022 fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022 competitive actions; and\n\u2022 weather and acts of God.\nOur business is also subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each year. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock could decrease.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers and managers, particularly regional market partners, market partners and managing partners. Competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or other key officers or managers or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business.\nOur failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations, including our trade names and logos, and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We, therefore, devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. The protective actions that we take, however, may not be enough to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees. Our inability to register or protect our marks and other propriety rights in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our competitive position in international markets.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms.\nThe development of our business may require significant additional capital in the future to, among other things, fund our operations and growth strategy. We may rely on bank financing and also may seek access to the debt and/or equity capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that these sources of financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our outstanding debt. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth could be impeded.\nOur existing credit facility limits our ability to incur additional debt.\nThe lenders' obligation to extend credit under our amended revolving credit facility depends on our maintaining certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. If we are unable to maintain these ratios, we would be unable to obtain additional financing under this amended revolving credit facility. The amended revolving credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness outside the revolving credit facility, except for the incurrence of secured indebtedness that in the aggregate exceeds 15% of our consolidated tangible net worth or circumstances where the incurrence of secured or unsecured indebtedness would prevent us from complying with our financial covenants.\nWe have also entered into other loan agreements with other lenders to finance various restaurants which impose financial covenants that are less restrictive than those imposed by our existing revolving credit facility. A default under these loan agreements could result in a default under our existing revolving credit facility, which in turn would limit our ability to secure additional funds under that facility. As of December 30, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our lenders' covenants.\nWe may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to the impairment of long-lived assets, we make certain estimates and projections with regard to company-owned restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. When impairment triggers are deemed to exist for any company-owned restaurant, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant are compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.\nWe also review the value of our goodwill on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may exceed the fair value of such assets. The estimates of fair value are based upon the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation measurements and techniques.\nThe estimates of fair value used in these analyses require the use of judgment, certain assumptions and estimates of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates or assumptions,\nadditional impairment charges may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe acquisition of existing restaurants from our franchisees and other strategic transactions may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nWe plan to opportunistically acquire existing restaurants from our franchisees over time. Additionally, from time to time, we evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts. To successfully execute any acquisition or development strategy, we will need to identify suitable acquisition or development candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition or development terms and obtain appropriate financing. Any acquisition or future development that we pursue, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n\u2022 material adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition or development as the restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering into new domestic or international markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022 risks inherent in accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, and our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and\n\u2022 the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.\nFuture acquisitions of existing restaurants from our franchisees or other strategic partners, which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of shares of common stock or a combination of both, could have a dilutive impact on holders of our common stock, and result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. The development of additional concepts and/or the entrance into international markets may not be as successful as our experience in the development of the Texas Roadhouse concept domestically. Development rates for newer brands may differ significantly as there is increased risk in the development of a new restaurant concept or system.\nApproximately 14% of our company-owned restaurants are located in Texas and, as a result, we are sensitive to economic and other trends and developments in that state.\nAs of December 30, 2014, we operated a total of 51 company-owned restaurants in Texas. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in this state, including its labor market. In addition, given our geographic concentration in this state, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in Texas could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other occurrences in Texas such as local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters.\nOur expansion into new domestic and/or international markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with the area.\nSome of our new restaurants will be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets. An additional risk of expanding into new markets is the lack of market awareness of our brands. Restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volume than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant-level\noperating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average unit volume, if at all, thereby affecting our overall profitability.\nWe are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nThe possibility of future misstatement exists due to inherent limitations in our control systems, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur business is affected by changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food products. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our restaurants or cuisine, particularly beef, would harm our business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete with many food service businesses.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We compete with many well-established food service companies on the basis of taste, quality and price of products offered, guest service, atmosphere, location and overall guest experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individual restaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to well-capitalized national restaurant companies. We also face competition from the supermarket industry which offers \"convenient\" meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section. In addition, improving product offerings of fast casual and quick-service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing and the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry better than we can. As our competitors expand their operations, we expect competition to intensify. We also compete with other restaurant chains and other retail establishments for quality site locations and hourly employees.\nChanges in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Any increase in food prices, particularly proteins, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our\ncontrol, such as food supply constrictions, weather conditions, food safety concerns, product recalls, global market and trade conditions, and government regulations. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, because we provide a moderately priced product, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our guests. Also, if we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we will realize the full benefit of any adjustment due to changes in our guests' menu item selections and guest traffic.\nWe currently purchase the majority of our beef from four beef suppliers under annual contracts. While we maintain relationships with additional suppliers, if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which would harm our business.\nThe food service industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues, which can cause guests to avoid our restaurants and result in significant liabilities or litigation costs.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests, consumer groups or government authorities resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging guests from eating at our restaurants. We could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us or litigation costs regardless of the result.\nGiven the marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices in recent years, individuals have access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate as is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealth concerns relating to the consumption of beef or other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nLike other restaurant chains, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef, the key ingredient in many of our menu items, or negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury in general. In recent years there has been negative publicity concerning e-coli, hepatitis A, \"mad cow,\" \"foot-and-mouth\" disease and \"bird flu.\" The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests. In November 2014, the FDA published final regulations to implement the menu labeling provisions of the PPACA. Companies have one year to comply with the new regulations. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general. The labeling requirements and any negative publicity concerning any of the food products we serve may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the labeling requirements or negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu offerings or their ingredients, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new concept or products, and we may not be able to attract sufficient new guests to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have\ndifferent or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of a change in our concept and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business.\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing demand and increasing costs.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food-borne illnesses and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Any report or publicity linking us to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect our brands and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales.\nFurthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. We cannot assure that all food items are properly maintained during transport throughout the supply chain and that our employees will identify all products that may be spoiled and should not be used in our restaurants. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our restaurants, could subject us or our suppliers to a food recall.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as Ebola, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1. To the extent that a virus is food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product. To the extent that a virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised or required, to avoid gathering in public places, any one of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, unionization, increased minimum and tip wage, state unemployment rates or employee benefits costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. The federal government and numerous states have enacted legislation resulting in tip and/or minimum wage increases as well as pre-determined future increases. We anticipate that additional legislation will be enacted in future periods. The PPACA includes provisions requiring health care coverage for all Americans in 2015. The legislation imposes implementation effective dates that began in 2010 and extend through 2020, and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies or federal regulations. While we believe that the impact of the requirement to provide health insurance benefits to employees that are more extensive than what we currently provide is manageable, the requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. In addition, a shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes could also increase our labor costs. Our operating expenses will be adversely affected to the extent that we are not able or are unwilling to offset these costs through higher prices on our products.\nMoreover, we could suffer from significant indirect costs, including restaurant disruptions due to management or hourly labor turnover and potential delays in new restaurant openings or adverse guest reactions to inadequate guest service levels due to staff shortages. Competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs, together with greater recruitment and training expense. A shortage in the labor pool could also cause our restaurants to be required to operate with reduced staff, which could negatively impact our ability to provide adequate service levels to our guests.\nIn addition, our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff, to keep pace with our growth strategy. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary to operate our restaurants and compliance with governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Such regulations are subject to change from time to time. The failure to obtain and maintain these licenses, permits and approvals, including liquor licenses, could adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failure to obtain the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may revoke, suspend or deny renewal of our liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations.\nIn addition to our having to comply with these licensing requirements, various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum and tip wage requirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and working conditions. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including:\n\u2022 additional government-imposed increases in minimum and/or tipped wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence, sick leave, and mandated health benefits;\n\u2022 increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities;\n\u2022 any failure of our employees to comply with laws and regulations governing citizenship or residency requirements resulting in disruption of our work force and adverse publicity against us;\n\u2022 a reduction in the number of states that allow gratuities to be credited toward minimum wage requirements; and\n\u2022 increased employee litigation including claims under federal and/or state wage and hour laws.\nThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.\nComplaints or litigation may hurt us.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered as a result of a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding consumer, workplace and employment matters, wage and hour claims, discrimination and similar matters, or we could become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a\ngrowing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests. In addition, we are subject to \"dram shop\" statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop statutes. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nWe rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness or interruption could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, payment of obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms could result in delays in guest service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nWe may incur costs resulting from breaches of security related to confidential guest and/or employee information.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests and employees. Hardware, software or other applications we develop and procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems and facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees or vendors. In addition, we accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2014, approximately 76% of our transactions were by credit or debit cards, and such card usage could increase. Other retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card along with employee information may have been stolen. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of alleged theft of guest and/or employee information, and we may also be the subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these type of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, in excess of our insurance coverage, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such damages could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our health, workers compensation, general liability, employment practices liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves\nfor these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure, Our Stock Ownership and Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings, \"blank check\" preferred stock and three-year staggered terms for our Board of Directors. Blank check preferred stock enables our Board of Directors, without approval of the stockholders, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of blank check preferred stock may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock as our Board of Directors may designate and issue preferred stock with terms that are senior to our common stock. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits us from engaging in \"business combinations\" with \"interested shareholders\" (with some exceptions) unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of this provision could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board of Directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90427, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "TXRH"}
