{"cik": "1116521", "company": "AVAYA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this report, including but not limited to, the discussion under Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur degree of leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness.\nThe significant terms of our financing agreements can be found in Note 10, \"Financing Arrangements,\" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2015, our total indebtedness was $6,042 million (excluding capital lease obligations). As of September 30, 2015, the Company had $3,284 million, $2,683 million, $55 million and $20 million of outstanding borrowings under Avaya Inc.'s senior secured credit facility (\"Senior Secured Credit Agreement\"), senior secured notes due April 1, 2019 (the \"2019 senior secured notes\") and the indenture governing our senior secured notes due March 1, 2021 (the \"2021 senior secured notes\" and, together with the 2019 senior secured notes, the \"notes\"), senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the \"Domestic ABL\") and the senior secured foreign asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"Foreign ABL\"), respectively. The Company regularly evaluates market conditions, its liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance its capital structure. If market conditions are favorable, we may refinance our existing debt or issue additional securities.\nOur degree of leverage could have consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our Domestic ABL, our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and certain foreign subsidiaries of our Foreign ABL are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and our other ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nWe expect to make payments of approximately $451 million during fiscal 2016 in principal and interest associated with long-term debt and interest associated with our revolving credit facilities and senior secured notes, although we may elect to make additional principal payments under certain circumstances. The expected payments are exclusive of repayments we have made or may make with respect to revolving debt under our revolving credit facilities. In the ordinary course of business, we may from time to time borrow and repay amounts under our revolving credit facilities to meet business needs.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us under any of our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our\nscheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. Accordingly, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain any proceeds on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit in certain respects our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit facilities, the indentures governing the 2019 senior secured notes and the indenture governing the 2021 senior secured notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specific types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries' ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt and issue or sell certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nincur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets to, or merge or consolidate with, another company.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or all of our credit facilities and/or the indentures governing the notes. In the event of any default under any of our credit facilities, the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations, to be due and payable, which would be an event of default under the indentures governing the notes.\nWe have refinanced our and our subsidiaries' debt in the past but there is no assurance we will be able to refinance all or any portion of our or our subsidiaries' debt in the future. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due, the applicable secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our or our subsidiaries' borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nThe market opportunity for business collaboration products and services may not develop in the ways that we anticipate.\nThe demand for our products and services can change quickly and in ways that we may not anticipate because the market in which we operate is characterized by rapid, and sometimes disruptive, technological developments, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and a limited ability to accurately forecast future customer orders. Our operating results may be adversely affected if the market opportunity for our products and services does not develop in the ways that we anticipate or if other technologies become more accepted or standard in our industry or disrupt our technology platforms.\nOur strategy depends in part on our ability to rely on our indirect sales channel.\nAn important element of our go-to-market strategy to expand sales coverage and increase market absorption of new products is our global network of alliance partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers and system integrators. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our relationships with channel partners were to deteriorate, if our support pricing or other services strategies conflict with those of our channel partners, if any of our competitors were to enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel partner, if channel partners do not become enabled to sell new products or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken. In addition, we may expend time, money and other resources on developing and maintaining channel relationships that are ultimately unsuccessful. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing relationships with channel partners. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers or market share. Although the terms of individual channel partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year with automatic renewal for successive one year terms and generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30 days prior written notice. Our standard program agreements for distributors generally may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with alliance partners were terminated. See \"Our Business-Avaya Connect\" for more information on our global business partner program and the standard terms of our program agreements.\nWe face formidable competition from providers of unified communications, contact center and networking products and related services; as these markets evolve, we expect competition to intensify and expand to include companies that do not currently compete directly against us.\nOur unified communications products and services compete with companies such as Cisco, Microsoft, NEC, Unify, Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei, in the enterprise segment; with companies such as ShoreTel and Mitel, in the midmarket; and with companies such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (\"Cisco\"), Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\"), NEC Corporation (\"NEC\"), Unify GmbH & Co. Kg (\"Unify\"), Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (\"Huawei\") in the enterprise segment; with companies such as NEC, ShoreTel, Inc. (\"ShoreTel\") and Mitel Networks Corp. (\"Mitel\") in the midmarket; and with companies such as Cisco, Broadsoft Inc. (\"Broadsoft\"), Microsoft, 8x8, Inc. (\"8x8\"), RingCentral, Inc. (\"RingCentral\"), ShoreTel and Mitel in cloud products and services. Our video products and services compete with companies such as Cisco, Polycom Inc., Huawei, ZTE Corporation (\"ZTE\"), Vidyo, Blue Jeans and LifeSize (now a division of Logitech International S.A.).\nOur contact center products and services compete with companies such as Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. (\"Genesys\"), Cisco, Huawei, Enghouse Interactive (\"Enghouse\") and Mitel in the enterprise segment and with companies such as Cisco, Genesys, Enghouse and Interactive Intelligence, Inc. or Interactive Intelligence, in the midmarket and cloud products and services.\nOur networking products and services compete with companies such as Cisco, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company (\"HP\", formerly Hewlett-Packard Company), Huawei, Dell Inc. (\"Dell\") and Juniper Networks, Inc. (\"Juniper\") primarily with respect to L2/L3 ethernet switching.\nWe face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in these regions, such as Huawei and ZTE in China, Intelbras in Latin America and Panasonic in Asia.\nWhile we believe our global, in-house end-to-end services organization provides us with a competitive advantage, we face competition from companies like those above offering services, either directly or indirectly through their channel partners, with respect to their own product offerings, as well as many value-added resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and network service providers.\nIn addition, because the business collaboration market continues to evolve and technology continues to develop rapidly, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete against us, but whose current business activities may bring them into competition with us in the future. In particular, this may be the case as business, information technology and communications applications deployed on converged networks become more integrated to support business collaboration. We may face increased competition from current leaders in information technology infrastructure, information technology, consumer products, personal and business applications and the software that connects the network infrastructure to those applications. With respect to services, we may also face competition from companies that seek to sell remotely hosted services or software as a service directly to the end customer. Competition from these potential market entrants may take many forms, including offering products and applications similar to those we offer as part of another offering. In addition, these technologies continue to move from a proprietary environment to an open standards-based environment.\nSeveral of our existing competitors have, and many of our future competitors may have, greater financial, personnel, technical, research and development and other resources, more well-established brands or reputations and broader customer bases than we do and, as a result, these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to potential acquisitions and other market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Some of these competitors may have customer bases that are more geographically balanced than ours and, therefore, may be less affected by an economic downturn in a particular region. Other competitors may have deeper expertise in a particular stand-alone technology that develops more quickly than we anticipate. Competitors with greater resources also may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or other incentives that we cannot match or do not offer. Industry consolidations may also create competitors with broader and more geographic coverage and the ability to reach enterprises through communications service providers. Existing customers of data networking companies that compete against us may be inclined to purchase enterprise communications products and services from their current data networking or software vendors rather than from us. Also, as communications and data networks converge, we may face competition from systems integrators that traditionally have been focused on data network integration.\nWe cannot predict which competitors may enter our markets in the future, what form such competition may take or whether we will be able to respond effectively to the entry of new competitors into competition with us or the rapid evolution in technology and product development that has characterized our businesses. In addition, in order to effectively compete with any new market entrant, we may need to make additional investments in our business, use more capital resources than our business currently requires or reduce prices, any of which may materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur products and services may fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards.\nThe market in which we operate is characterized by rapid, and sometimes disruptive, technological developments, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changes in customer requirements. In addition, both traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in this market and competing for customers. As next-generation business collaboration technology continues to evolve, we must keep pace in order to maintain or expand our market leading position. We recently introduced a significant number of new product offerings and are increasingly focused on new, high value software products, as a revenue driver. If we are not able to successfully develop and bring these new products to market in a timely manner, achieve market acceptance of our products and services or identify new market opportunities for our products and services, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our operating results\nWe are a global company with significant international operations and transact business in many currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary currency exposures relate to net operating expenses denominated in euro, Indian rupee, British pound, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and the geographic mix of our business changes. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain intercompany obligations. However any attempts to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk may be unsuccessful and result in an adverse impact to our operating results.\nAs our business and operations relationships have expanded globally, certain operational and logistical challenges as well as changes in economic or political conditions and natural disasters, in a specific country or region, could negatively affect our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition or those of our channel partners and distributors.\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support operations and significant amounts of our research and development activities in countries outside of the U.S. and also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers and our channel partners. For fiscal 2015 we derived 46% of our revenue from sales outside of the U.S. The vast majority of our contract manufacturing also takes place outside the U.S., primarily in southern China. The transition of even a portion of our operations or functions to a foreign country involves a number of logistical and technical challenges, including:\n\u2022\nchallenges in effectively managing operations in jurisdictions with lower cost structures as a result of several factors, including time zone differences and regulatory, legal, employment, cultural and logistical issues;\n\u2022\nthe potential negative impact on our existing employees as a result of the relocation of workforce resources;\n\u2022\nan inability to predict the extent of local government support;\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified workers and the level of competition in offshore markets for qualified employees, including skilled design and technical employees, as companies expand their operations offshore; and\n\u2022\nfuture political, monetary and economic conditions in any specific offshore location.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our offshore operations, we may be unable to produce the expected cost savings from any shifts of operations to offshore jurisdictions and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our future operating results, including our ability to import our products from, export our products to, or sell our products in, various countries, could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors such as political conditions, economic conditions including trade sanctions, legal and regulatory constraints, protectionist and local security legislation, difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights such as against counterfeiting of our products, relationships with employees and works councils, unfavorable tax and currency regulations, health pandemics or similar issues, natural disasters and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we and our contract manufacturers and business partners currently operate or intend to operate in the future, including in the U.S. Our corporate headquarters is located in the Silicon Valley area of California, a seismically active region, and a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane or a flood, in that area of California or elsewhere where we and/or our channel partners and distributors have business operations could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other critical functions. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. Furthermore, our prospective effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among others, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.\nOur revenues are dependent on general economic conditions and the willingness of enterprises to invest in technology.\nWe believe that enterprises continue to be cautious about sustained economic growth and have tried to maintain or improve profitability through cost control and constrained spending. That may include delaying or rejecting capital projects, including with respect to the implementation of our products and services. In addition, we believe there is a growing market trend around Cloud consumption preferences with more customers exploring operating expense models as opposed to capital expense models for procuring technology. We believe the market trend toward Cloud models will continue as customers seek ways of reducing their overhead and other costs. In addition, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic unrest and on political or social conditions. All of the foregoing may result in continued pressure on our ability to increase our revenue as well as create competitive pricing pressures and price erosion. If these or other conditions limit our ability to grow revenue or cause our revenue to decline our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in the past a portion of our revenues which come from the U.S. federal government sector were impacted because of government shutdowns. In the event of future shutdowns or uncertainties, there can be no assurance that that portion of our revenues will not be impacted.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Fluctuations in our financial results from period to period are caused by many factors, including, but not limited to, the size and timing of individual orders; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the mix of products sold by us; and general economic conditions.\nAlso it is difficult to predict our revenue for a particular quarter, especially in light of the growing demand for IT purchases under a usage-based operating expense model instead of a capital expense model and the increasing proportion of our revenue coming from software and services. Both of these trends delay the timing of our revenue recognition. In addition, execution of sales opportunities sometimes traverses from the intended fiscal quarter to the next. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.\nIn addition, we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. Typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nWe are dependent on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected.\nAs a leader in technology and innovation in business collaboration and communications, we generally protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other measures. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications that we have filed or that our patents will be sufficient to protect our key technology from misappropriation or falling into the public domain, nor can assurances be made that any of our patents, patent applications, trademarks or our other intellectual property or proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, our business is global and the level of protection of our proprietary technology will vary by country, particularly in countries that do not have well developed judicial systems or laws that adequately protect intellectual property rights. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents and other proprietary rights are costly and unpredictable and may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a disadvantage to others who did not incur the substantial time and expense we incurred to create our products.\nCertain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to unintended consequences and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nSome of our products contain software from open source code sources. The use of such open source code may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer our products that use open source code to third parties for no cost. We monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. However, the use of such open source code may ultimately subject some of our products to unintended conditions, which could require us to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nIf we fail to retain or attract key employees, our business may be harmed.\nThe success of our business depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employee base. If we are unable to retain and recruit sufficiently experienced and capable employees, especially in the key areas of product development, sales, services\nand management, our business and financial results may suffer. Experienced and capable employees in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. In addition, talented employees may choose to leave the Company because of our cost reduction initiatives. When talented employees leave, we may have difficulty replacing them and our business may suffer. While we strive to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the employees that we need to achieve our business objectives.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers, as well as warehousing and distribution logistics providers.\nWe have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers produce the vast majority of products in facilities located in southern China, with other products manufactured in facilities located in Israel, Mexico, Malaysia, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Ireland and the U.S. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs furnished or approved by us and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. Although we closely manage the transition process when manufacturing changes are required, we could experience disruption to our operations during any such transition. Any such disruption could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components and resell them separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand. In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited source of suppliers. Delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations. We have also outsourced substantially all of our warehousing and distribution logistics operations to several providers of such services on a global basis, and any delays or material changes in such services could cause significant disruption to our operations.\nIf we are unable to integrate acquired businesses into ours effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we seek to expand our business through acquisitions. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and, where desired, their product portfolios, into ours, and therefore we may not be able to realize the intended benefits from an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, or product portfolios, or if they fail to perform as we anticipate, our existing businesses and our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected. If the due diligence of the operations of acquired businesses performed by us and by third parties on our behalf is inadequate or flawed, or if we later discover unforeseen financial or business liabilities, acquired businesses and their assets may not perform as expected. Additionally, acquisitions could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and, where deemed desirable, transitioning overlapping products to be a single product line and the diversion of capital and management's attention away from other business issues and opportunities. We may fail to retain employees acquired through acquisitions, which may negatively impact the integration efforts. For all the reasons set forth above, the failure to integrate acquired businesses effectively may adversely impact Avaya's business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices and claims from third parties asserting that our proprietary or licensed products, systems and software infringe their intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the number of these notices and claims will not increase in the future or that we do not in fact infringe those intellectual property rights. Irrespective of the merits of these claims, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. These matters may result in any number of outcomes for us, including entering into licensing agreements, redesigning our products to avoid infringement, being enjoined from selling products that are found to infringe, paying damages if products are found to infringe and indemnifying customers from infringement claims as part of our contractual obligations. Royalty or license agreements may be very costly and we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Such agreements may cause operating margins to decline. In addition, some of our employees previously have been employed at other companies that provide similar products and services. We may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. These claims and other successful claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could materially adversely affect our operating results. We have made and will likely continue to make investments to license and/or acquire the use of third-party intellectual property rights and technology as part of our strategy to manage this risk, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any costs relating to such activity will not be material. We may also be subject to additional notice, attribution and other compliance requirements to the extent we incorporate open source software into our applications. In addition, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that a customer's use of our products, systems or software infringes the third party's intellectual property rights. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to indemnify our customers for some of the costs and damages related to such an infringement claim. Any indemnification requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results. See Note 19, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain legal proceedings regarding intellectual property.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions including the U.S. may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation, such as interpretations as to the legality of tax advantages granted under the European Union (\"EU\") state aid rules. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA breach of the security of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third party providers could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on the security of our information systems and, in certain circumstances, those of our third party providers, such as vendors, consultants and contract manufacturers, to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. In addition, the growth of BYOD programs has heightened the need for enhanced security measures. Information technology system failures, including a breach of our or our third party providers' data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders, disruptions in the manufacture or shipment of products or, delivery of services or an unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third party providers, information systems and our products and services may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our or our customers' proprietary information. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of mission critical business collaboration and communications products and services and could cause irreparable damage to us or our systems regardless of whether we or our third party providers are able to adequately recover critical systems following a systems failure.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety, laws, regulations, costs and other liabilities.\nWe are subject to a wide range of governmental requirements relating to safety, health and environmental protection. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, lose customers and damage our reputation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We are subject to environmental laws governing the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination that may impose joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and remediating releases of regulated materials at currently or formerly owned or operated sites and at third-party waste disposal sites. We are also subject to various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the material content and electrical design of our products that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products. For example, the EU has adopted the Restriction on Hazardous Substances (\"RoHS\") and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\"WEEE Directive\") with similar laws and regulations being enacted in other regions. Effective in May 2014, the United States requires companies to begin publicly disclosing their use of conflict minerals that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (\"DRC\") or an adjoining country. Additionally, requirements such as the EU Energy Using Product (\"EuP Directive\") are being imposed to address the operating characteristics of our products. Our failure or the undetected failure of our supply chain to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety requirements could subject us to liabilities exceeding our reserves or adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, a number of climate change regulations and initiatives are either in force or pending at the local, federal and international levels. Our operations and our supply chain could face increased climate change-related regulations, modifications to transportation to meet lower emission requirements and changes to types of materials used for products and packaging to reduce emissions, increased utility costs to address cleaner energy technologies, increased costs related to severe weather events, and emissions reductions associated with operations, business travel or products. These yet-to-be defined costs and changes to operations could have a financial impact on our business.\nBusiness collaboration products are complex, and design defects, errors, failures or \"bugs\" may be difficult to detect and correct.\nBusiness collaboration products are complex, integrating hardware, software and many elements of a customer's existing network and communications infrastructure. Despite testing conducted prior to the release of products to the market and quality\nassurance programs, hardware may malfunction and software may contain \"bugs\" that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such issues could interfere with the expected operation of a product, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins.\nDepending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a material impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, the temporary or permanent withdrawal from an application, product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, an increase in warranty claims, lawsuits by customers or customers' or channel partners' end users, or application or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover claims that are successfully asserted against us.\nPension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance liabilities could impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe sponsor non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a portion of our U.S. employees and retirees, and postretirement benefit plans for a portion of our U.S. retirees that include healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage. We froze benefit accruals and additional participation in our plans for our U.S. management employees effective December 31, 2003. We also subsequently amended the postretirement benefit plan for U.S. management employees as follows: effective January 1, 2013, to terminate retiree dental coverage and to cease providing medical and prescription drug coverage to a retiree, dependent, or lawful spouse who has attained age 65; effective January 1, 2015, to reduce our maximum contribution toward the cost of providing benefits under the plan; and effective January 1, 2016, to replace coverage through our group plan with coverage through the private insurance marketplace. Certain of our non-U.S. operations also have various retirement benefit programs covering substantially all of their employees. Some of these programs are considered to be defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. If one or more of our U.S. pension plans were to be terminated without being fully funded on a termination basis, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\") could obtain a lien on our assets for the amount of our liability, which would result in an event of default under each of our credit facilities. As a result, any such liens would have a material adverse effect on the Company, including our liquidity and financing arrangements. The measurement of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and postretirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants, including assumptions related to discount rates, investment returns on designated plan assets, health care cost trends, and demographic experience. If future economic or demographic trends and results are different from our assumptions, then our obligations and cash flow requirements could be higher than we currently estimate. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet required minimal funding of our defined benefit plans or to fund our other pension or postretirement healthcare and life insurance obligations, or if we are required or elect to fund any material portion of these obligations now or in the future, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. In addition, if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our pension or postretirement healthcare and life insurance obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be required to dispose of material assets or operations in order to meet our obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain any proceeds on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any such obligations then due. The PBGC has the authority under certain circumstances to petition a court to terminate an underfunded pension plan upon the occurrence of an event with respect to which the PBGC determines that the possible long-term loss of the PBGC with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated. If our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were to be terminated, we would incur a liability to the plans or the PBGC equal to the amount by which the liabilities of the plans, calculated on a termination basis, exceed the assets of the plans, which amount would likely exceed the amount that we have estimated to be the underfunded amount as of September 30, 2015.\nSee Note 14, \"Benefit Obligations,\" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our pension and postretirement benefit plans, including funding status.\nWe may incur liabilities as a result of our obligation to indemnify, and to share certain liabilities with, Lucent Technologies Inc. (\"Lucent\") in connection with our spin-off from Lucent in September 2000.\nPursuant to the Contribution and Distribution Agreement between us and Lucent, a predecessor to Alcatel-Lucent, Lucent contributed to us substantially all of the assets, liabilities and operations associated with its enterprise networking businesses and distributed all of the outstanding shares of our common stock to its stockholders. The Contribution and Distribution Agreement, among other things, provides that, in general, we will indemnify Lucent for all liabilities including certain pre-distribution tax obligations of Lucent relating to our businesses and all contingent liabilities accruing pre-distribution primarily relating to our businesses or otherwise assigned to us. In addition, the Contribution and Distribution Agreement provides that certain contingent liabilities not directly identifiable with one of the parties accruing pre-distribution will be shared in the proportion of 90% by Lucent and 10% by us. The Contribution and Distribution Agreement also provides that contingent liabilities accruing pre-distribution in excess of $50 million that are primarily related to Lucent's businesses shall be borne 90% by Lucent and 10% us and contingent liabilities accruing pre-distribution in excess of $50 million that are primarily related to our businesses shall be borne equally by the parties. See Note 19, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to our audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain matters involving Lucent for which we have assumed responsibility under the Contribution and Distribution Agreement. We cannot assure you that Lucent will not submit a claim for indemnification or cost sharing to us in connection with any future matter. In addition, our ability to assess the impact of matters for which we may have to indemnify or share the cost with Lucent is made more difficult by the fact that we do not control the defense of these matters.\nIn addition, in connection with the distribution, we and Lucent entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for the periods ending on or before the distribution. Generally, pre-distribution taxes that are clearly attributable to the business of one party will be borne solely by that party, and other pre-distribution taxes will be shared by the parties based on a formula set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement. Costs borne by Avaya under the Tax Sharing Agreement could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost-reduction initiatives.\nAs discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Continued Focus on Cost Structure,\u201d we have initiated costs savings programs designed to streamline operations and we continue to evaluate additional similar opportunities. These types of cost-reduction activities are complex. Even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we expect, we may not be able to achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate, or on the timetable we anticipate, and any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Our ability to realize the gross margin improvements and other efficiencies expected to result from these initiatives is subject to many risks, including delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these initiatives, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time and unexpected costs associated with operating our business, our success in reinvesting the savings arising from these initiatives, time required to complete planned actions, absence of material issues associated with workforce reductions and avoidance of unexpected disruptions in service. A failure to implement our initiatives or realize expected benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition that could be material.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and related risks associated with acquisitions.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary to enable us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our efforts to prevent financial fraud. However, we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, is designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist. Accordingly, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nMoreover, following any acquisition, we may experience delays in implementing or be unable to implement the required internal financial reporting controls and procedures, which could result in enforcement actions, the assessment of penalties and civil suits, failure to meet reporting obligations and other material and adverse events that could have a negative effect on us. If addition, if material weaknesses in our internal control are identified or we acquire companies with a material weakness, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our degree of leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' currently anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.\nThe claims of holders of our notes to assets of any non-guarantor subsidiary are structurally subordinated to all of the creditors of that subsidiary which may affect our ability to pay principal and interest on our notes.\nWe rely upon dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate a significant portion of the funds necessary to meet our obligations. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, in general, our foreign subsidiaries, unrestricted subsidiaries, non-wholly owned subsidiaries and other subsidiaries that do not borrow or guarantee our\nindebtedness under our credit facilities are not required to guarantee our notes. Accordingly, claims of holders of the notes are structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors. This means that the creditors of the non-guarantor subsidiaries have priority in their claims on the assets of such subsidiaries over the creditors of us, including the holders of the notes.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on one or more series of our notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under any of our credit facilities, that is not waived by the required lenders, or a default under any of the indentures governing our notes and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on each series of our notes and substantially decrease the market value of such notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under any of our credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our credit facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not be able to repurchase our notes upon a change of control.\nUpon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Further, we may be contractually restricted under the terms of our credit facilities from repurchasing all of the notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to purchase the notes unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our credit facilities. Our failure to repurchase one or more series of notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture governing such notes and a cross default under our credit facilities and the indentures governing other series of notes. The credit facilities also provide that a change of control will be a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings and loans thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void or limit the amount payable under our notes or the related guarantees, and, if that occurs, a holder of our notes may receive limited or no payments on the notes and guarantees affected.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of our notes and the incurrence of the related guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:\n\u2022\nwe or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business;\n\u2022\nwe or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such guarantor\u2019s ability to pay as they mature; or\n\u2022\nwe or any of the guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied.\nIf a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or limit the amount of payment or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor, or require the\nholders of the notes to repay any amounts received. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, a holder of our notes may not receive any payment on the notes. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. Under applicable law, a court may determine that a debtor has not received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the notes or the guarantees would not be voided, limited in amount or subordinated to our or any of our guarantors\u2019 other debt.\nWe are controlled by Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital, whose interests may not be aligned with a holder of our notes.\nAvaya is a wholly owned subsidiary of Avaya Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (\u201cParent\u201d). Parent was formed by affiliates of two private equity firms, Silver Lake Partners (\u201cSilver Lake\u201d) and TPG Capital (\u201cTPG\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cSponsors\u201d). Silver Lake and TPG, through Parent, acquired Avaya in a transaction that was completed on October 26, 2007 (the \u201cMerger\u201d). See discussion in Note 1, \u201cBackground and Basis of Presentation - Merger,\u201d to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Sponsors and their affiliated funds own a majority of the outstanding equity securities of our Parent. In addition, the Sponsors control substantially all of the voting power of our outstanding equity securities and therefore ultimately control all of our affairs and policies, including the election of our Board of Directors, the approval of certain actions such as amending our charter, commencing bankruptcy proceedings and taking certain corporate actions (including, without limitation, incurring debt, issuing stock, selling assets and engaging in mergers and acquisitions) and appointing members of our management. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Sponsors could be in conflict with a holder of our notes. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the Sponsors might pursue strategies that favor equity investors. The Sponsors may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to a holder of our notes. Additionally, the Sponsors are not prohibited from making investments in any of our competitors.\nThe secured indebtedness under our Domestic ABL and Foreign ABL will be effectively senior to our notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such facilities on a first-priority basis and the secured indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement will be effectively senior to our notes to the extent of the value of the real estate securing such facility.\nOur Domestic ABL and Foreign ABL have a first priority lien in certain of our personal property and that of the subsidiary guarantors, with certain exceptions. Our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and our notes have a second priority lien in that property. The indentures governing the notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by such property in the future. The first priority liens in the collateral securing indebtedness under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL and any such future indebtedness will be higher in priority as to such collateral than the security interests securing our notes and the guarantees thereof. Holders of the indebtedness under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL and any other indebtedness secured by higher priority liens on such collateral will be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of such collateral to repay such indebtedness in full before a holder of the notes will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral. As a result, holders of our notes will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of assets securing our Domestic ABL and Foreign ABL on a higher priority basis after all indebtedness and other obligations under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL and any other obligations secured by higher priority liens on such assets are repaid in full. Our notes will be effectively junior in right of payment to indebtedness under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL and any other indebtedness secured by higher priority liens on such collateral to the extent of the realizable value of such collateral.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Agreement has a first priority lien in certain of our real estate and that of the subsidiary guarantors, with certain exceptions. Our Domestic ABL and Foreign ABL have a second priority lien in that property. The indentures governing our senior secured notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured on a first-priority basis by such property in the future. Our senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are not secured by a lien on such property. Holders of the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and any other indebtedness secured by liens on such collateral will be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of such collateral to repay such indebtedness in full before a holder of our senior secured notes will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral. As a result, holders of our senior secured notes will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of such collateral after all indebtedness and other obligations secured by liens on such assets are repaid in full. Our senior secured notes will be effectively junior in right of payment to indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and any other indebtedness secured by higher priority liens on such collateral to the extent of the realizable value of such collateral.\nThe right of holders of our 2019 senior secured notes to receive proceeds from the sale of collateral securing our 2019 senior secured notes will be pari passu with (and junior with respect to real estate collateral to) the claims of lenders and counterparties under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and certain future indebtedness.\nThe loans under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and our 2019 senior secured notes are, and certain future indebtedness may be, secured on a pari passu basis by the same collateral consisting of a first priority perfected lien and security interest in substantially all of our and the guarantors\u2019 assets (except for cash, accounts, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, chattel paper, inventory and proceeds thereof, as to which the 2019 senior secured notes and the Senior Secured Credit Agreement will be secured by a second priority lien and except for real estate, as to which the 2019 senior secured notes will not be secured), subject to certain exceptions. As a result, holders of our 2019 senior secured notes will receive distributions from any foreclosure proceeds of any of our and the guarantors\u2019 assets constituting collateral (other than real estate) for the 2019 senior secured notes on a pro rata basis with the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and certain future indebtedness and holders of our 2019 senior secured notes will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of real estate collateral after all indebtedness and other obligations secured by liens on such assets are repaid in full.\nThe right of holders of our 2021 senior secured notes to receive proceeds from the sale of collateral securing our 2021 senior secured notes will be junior to the claims of lenders and counterparties under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL, Senior Secured Credit Agreement, 2019 senior secured notes and certain future indebtedness.\nThe indebtedness under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL, Senior Secured Credit Agreement and our notes are, and certain future indebtedness may be, secured on a senior priority basis by the same collateral consisting of substantially all of our and the guarantors\u2019 assets (except for real estate, as to which the 2019 senior secured notes are not secured), subject to certain exceptions. As a result, holders of the indebtedness under our Domestic ABL, our Foreign ABL, our Senior Secured Credit Agreement, our 2019 senior secured notes and any other indebtedness secured by higher priority liens on such collateral than the lien securing the 2021 senior secured notes will be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of such collateral to repay such indebtedness in full before holders of our 2021 senior secured notes will be entitled to any recovery from such collateral. As a result, holders of our 2021 senior secured notes will only be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of assets securing our Domestic ABL, our Foreign ABL, our Senior Secured Credit Agreement, our 2019 senior secured notes and such other indebtedness secured on a higher priority basis than the 2021 senior secured notes are secured after all indebtedness and other obligations under our Domestic ABL, our Foreign ABL, our Senior Secured Credit Agreement, our 2019 senior secured notes and any other obligations secured by higher priority liens on such assets than the 2021 senior secured notes, are repaid in full.\nThe collateral securing our notes may not be valuable enough to satisfy all the obligations secured by the collateral.\nWe have secured our obligations under our notes by the pledge of certain of our assets. The value of the pledged assets in the event of liquidation will depend upon market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. No independent appraisals of any of the pledged property were prepared by or on behalf of us in connection with the offering of our notes. Accordingly, we cannot assure holders of our notes that the proceeds of any sale of the pledged assets following an acceleration to maturity with respect to our notes would be sufficient to satisfy, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on our notes and the other debt secured thereby.\nIf the proceeds of any sale of the pledged assets were not sufficient to repay all amounts due on our notes after satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens, holders of our notes (to the extent such notes were not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets) would have only an unsecured claim against our remaining assets. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure a holder of notes that the pledged assets will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. To the extent that liens securing obligations under our credit facilities, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the indenture governing our notes and other rights, including liens on excluded assets, encumber any of the collateral securing our notes and the guarantees, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the collateral (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the collateral and the ability of the collateral agent, the trustees under the indentures or the holders of our notes to realize or foreclose on the collateral.\nOur 2019 senior secured notes and the related guarantees will be secured, subject to certain exceptions and to permitted liens, by a first priority lien in the collateral that secures our Senior Secured Credit Agreement on a first-priority basis and will share equally in right of payment to the extent of the value of such collateral securing such Senior Secured Credit Agreement on a first-priority basis. The indenture governing our 2019 senior secured notes permit us, subject to compliance with certain financial tests, to issue additional indebtedness secured by a lien that ranks equally with our 2019 senior secured notes. This would reduce amounts payable to holders of our 2019 senior secured notes from the proceeds of any sale of the collateral.\nOur 2021 senior secured notes and the related guarantees will be secured, subject to certain exceptions and to permitted liens, by a second priority lien in the collateral that secures our Senior Secured Credit Agreement on a second-priority basis and will\nnot share equally in right of payment to the extent value of such collateral securing such Senior Secured Credit Agreement on a first-priority basis.\nThe collateral securing our notes may be diluted under certain circumstances.\nThe collateral that secures the notes also secures the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and obligations under our Domestic ABL and Foreign ABL. The collateral may also secure additional indebtedness that we incur in the future, subject to restrictions on our ability to incur debt and liens under our Domestic ABL, Foreign ABL, Senior Secured Credit Agreement, and the indentures governing our notes. The rights of holders of our notes to the collateral would be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness secured by this collateral or portions thereof.\nThe rights of holders of our notes with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral will be substantially limited by the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement.\nThe collateral agents for the notes, the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and the collateral agent under our Domestic ABL are party to the amended and restated intercreditor agreement, entered into on October 29, 2012, between Citicorp USA, Inc. and Citibank, N.A., (as it may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, the \u201cABL Intercreditor Agreement\u201d). The ABL Intercreditor Agreement significantly restricts any action that may be taken by the collateral agents for the notes with respect to the collateral over which the holders of Domestic ABL loans have a first-priority lien (\u201cABL Priority Collateral\u201d), even during an event of default. Under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, at any time that obligations under our Domestic ABL are outstanding, any actions that may be taken with respect to (or in respect of) the ABL Priority Collateral that secures obligations under our Domestic ABL on a first-priority basis, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such ABL Priority Collateral and to control the conduct of such proceedings, and the approval of amendments to, releases of such ABL Priority Collateral from the lien of, and waivers of past defaults under, such documents relating to such ABL Priority Collateral, will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations under our Domestic ABL, and the holders of the notes and the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement, which are secured on a second-priority basis in the case of the 2019 senior secured notes and our Senior Secured Credit Agreement and a junior-priority basis in the case of the 2021 senior secured notes, by such ABL Priority Collateral, may be adversely affected. The ABL Priority Collateral so released will no longer secure our and the guarantors\u2019 obligations under the notes and the related guarantees. In addition, because the holders of the indebtedness under our Domestic ABL control the disposition of such ABL Priority Collateral, such holders could decide not to proceed against such ABL Priority Collateral, regardless of whether there is a default under the documents governing such indebtedness or under the indentures governing the notes. In such event, the only remedy available to holders of our notes would be to sue for payment on those notes and the related guarantees. In addition, under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the collateral agents for the notes may not assert any right of marshalling that may be available under applicable law with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral. Without this waiver of the right of marshalling, holders of indebtedness secured by first priority liens in the ABL Priority Collateral would likely be required to liquidate collateral on which the notes did not have a lien, if any, prior to liquidating the collateral, thereby maximizing the proceeds of the collateral (due to the reductions in the amount of the indebtedness with a prior claim on such collateral) that would be available to repay our obligations under the notes.\nAs a result of this waiver, the proceeds of sales of such ABL Priority Collateral could be applied to repay any indebtedness secured by first priority liens in such ABL Priority Collateral before applying proceeds of other collateral securing indebtedness, and a holder of notes may recover less than it would have if such proceeds were applied in the order most favorable to it.\nThe indentures governing the notes and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement contain certain provisions benefiting holders of indebtedness under our Domestic ABL, including provisions prohibiting the collateral agents for the notes and the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Agreement from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a number of important matters regarding the collateral and the financing to be provided to us. After such filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate and a holder of notes would be unable to raise an objection. In addition, the right of holders of obligations secured by first priority liens to foreclose upon and sell such collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default also would be subject to limitations under applicable bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also gives the holders of first priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral the right to access and use the collateral that secures the notes to allow those holders to protect the ABL Priority Collateral and to process, store and dispose of the ABL Priority Collateral.\nThe ABL Priority Collateral will also be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the lenders under our Domestic ABL and other creditors that have the benefit of first priority liens on such collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date the notes and related guarantees were issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the collateral agents for the notes or the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Agreement to realize or foreclose on such collateral.\nThe rights of holders of our notes in the collateral securing such notes may be adversely affected by the first lien intercreditor agreement.\nThe rights of the holders of our notes with respect to the collateral that secures such notes is subject to a first lien intercreditor agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that collateral on a pari passu basis (\u201cfirst lien obligations\u201d), including the obligations under the notes and our Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Under that intercreditor agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral, to control such proceedings and to approve amendments to releases of such collateral from the lien of, and waive past defaults under, such documents relating to such collateral, may be taken solely by the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Agreement until (1) our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the senior secured credit facility) or (2) 90 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing the notes or any other agreement governing first lien obligations. Under the circumstances described in clause (2) of the preceding sentence, the authorized representative of the holders of the indebtedness that represents the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by the collateral on a pari passu basis with the other first lien obligations (other than the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) and that has complied with the applicable notice provisions gains the right to take actions with respect to the collateral.\nEven if the authorized representative of the notes gains the right to take actions with respect to the collateral in the circumstances described in clause (2) above, the authorized representative must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to the collateral would revert to the authorized representative of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) if such lenders\u2019 authorized representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that collateral (i.e., we or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the notes permit us to issue additional series of obligations that also have a pari passu lien on the same collateral with the other first lien obligations. As explained above, any time that the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Agreement does not have the right to take actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the first lien intercreditor agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a pari passu lien on the collateral with the other first lien obligations. If we issue or incur additional first lien obligations in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for that additional indebtedness would be earlier in line to exercise rights under the first lien intercreditor agreement than the authorized representative for the notes.\nUnder the first lien intercreditor agreement, the authorized representative of the holders of the notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in- possession financing or to the use of the common collateral to secure that financing, subject to conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of this collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.\nThe collateral that secures and will secure the notes and related guarantees also is and will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the authorized representative of the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement during any period that such authorized representative controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the first lien intercreditor agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the collateral agents for the notes to realize or foreclose on such collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes.\nThe lenders under the credit facilities have the discretion to release the guarantors under the credit facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors to be released from their guarantees of the notes.\nWhile any obligations under the credit facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustees under the indentures governing the notes, at the discretion of lenders under the credit facilities, or if the related guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the credit facilities or any other indebtedness. The lenders under the credit facilities have the discretion to release the guarantees under the credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. Holders of our notes will not have a claim as creditors against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of our notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to the claims of holders of our notes.\nThere are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of our notes under which the collateral securing such notes and the related guarantees will be released automatically, without the consent of the holders of our notes or the consent of the trustees.\nUnder various circumstances, collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:\n\u2022\na sale, transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indentures governing the notes;\n\u2022\nwith respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee;\n\u2022\nwith respect to any collateral in which the notes have a second priority lien, upon any release by the lenders under our Domestic ABL or Foreign ABL of their first-priority security interest in such collateral; provided that, if the release occurs in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies by the collateral agent for the lenders under our Domestic ABL and/or Foreign ABL, the lien on that collateral will be automatically released but any proceeds thereof not used to repay the obligations under our Domestic ABL and/or Foreign ABL will be subject to liens in favor of the collateral agents for the noteholders and our Senior Secured Credit Agreement; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the collateral upon which the notes have a first priority lien, upon any release in connection with a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to that collateral directed by the authorized representative of the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement during any period in which such authorized representative controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the first lien intercreditor agreement. Even though holders of our notes share ratably with the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement, the authorized representative of the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Agreement will initially control actions with respect to the collateral, whether the holders of our notes agree or disagree with those actions.\nThe imposition of certain permitted liens will cause the assets on which such liens are imposed to be excluded from the collateral securing our notes and the related guarantees. There are also certain other categories of property that are also excluded from the collateral securing our notes.\nThe indentures governing our notes permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional debt, including purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens will be automatically excluded from the collateral securing our notes and the related guarantees to the extent the agreements governing such indebtedness prohibit additional liens. In addition, certain categories of assets are excluded from the collateral securing our notes and the guarantees. Excluded assets include, but are not limited to, among other things, the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, certain capital stock and other securities of our subsidiaries and equity investees, leaseholds or other non-fee simple interests in real property, fee simple interests in real property and the proceeds from any of the foregoing. If an event of default occurs and our notes are accelerated, such notes and the related guarantees will rank equally with the holders of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the relevant entity with respect to such excluded property.\nSales of assets by us or our subsidiary guarantors could reduce the pool of assets securing the notes and the related guarantees.\nThe security documents relating to our notes allow us and the guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the notes. To the extent we sell any assets that constitute such collateral, the proceeds from such sale will be subject to the liens securing our notes only to the extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute \u201ccollateral\u201d securing such notes and the guarantees under the security documents.\nThe rights of holders of our notes in the collateral securing such notes may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral.\nApplicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the collateral securing our notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such notes if and to the extent that the collateral agent was not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the indentures governing our notes. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement will have taken all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests, which may result in the loss of the priority of the security interest in favor of holders of our notes to which they would otherwise have been entitled. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as equipment subject to a certificate of title and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of holders of our notes in specified collateral. There can be no assurance that the trustees or the collateral agents for our notes will monitor, or that we will inform such trustees or collateral agents of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Neither the trustees nor the collateral agents for our notes have an obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interest. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of our notes against third parties.\nThe collateral securing our notes is subject to casualty risks.\nWe intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business. There are, however, some losses, including losses resulting from terrorist acts that may be either uninsurable or not\neconomically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, we cannot assure holders of our notes that the insurance proceeds will compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged assets, we cannot assure holders of our notes that the proceeds received by us in respect thereof will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including our notes and the related guarantees.\nBankruptcy laws may limit the ability of holders of our notes to realize value from the collateral securing such notes.\nThe right of the collateral agents to repossess and dispose of the pledged assets upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indentures governing our notes is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us before the collateral agents repossessed and disposed of the pledged assets. For example, under Title 11 of the United States Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon the bankruptcy filing, a secured creditor is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from such debtor, or taking other actions to levy against a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, the United States Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given \u201cadequate protection.\u201d The meaning of the term \u201cadequate protection\u201d may vary according to circumstances (and is within the discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such times as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. Generally, adequate protection payments, in the form of interest or otherwise, are not required to be paid by a debtor to a secured creditor unless the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the secured creditor\u2019s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. Due to the imposition of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term \u201cadequate protection\u201d and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict (1) how long payments under our notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, (2) whether or when the collateral agents could repossess or dispose of the pledged assets or (3) whether or to what extent a holder of notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the pledged assets through the requirement of \u201cadequate protection.\u201d\nIn the event of a bankruptcy of the Company or any of the guarantors of our indebtedness, holders of our notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of those notes exceed the fair market value of the collateral securing those notes.\nIn any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the collateral with respect to our notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then current principal amount of such notes. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that our notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to such notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral.\nOther consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would be, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of our notes to receive post-petition interest and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of our notes to receive other \u201cadequate protection\u201d under federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to our notes.\nAny future pledge of collateral in favor of a holder of notes might be voidable in bankruptcy.\nAny future pledge of collateral in favor of our lenders or holders of our senior secured indebtedness, including pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the indentures governing the notes, might be voidable by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, under the United States Bankruptcy Code, if the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits a holder of our notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced with 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.\nWe do not intend to offer to register the notes or to exchange the notes in a registered exchange offer.\nWe do not intend to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange those notes in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act. We will not be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), with respect to those notes. As a result, holders of our notes will only be entitled to receive certain information about us specified in the indentures governing the notes and information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. Except as included in the reports filed with the SEC, information about our company will be provided to holders of our notes on a confidential basis and may not be copied or reproduced, nor may it be distributed or any of its contents disclosed, to anyone other than holders of our notes and prospective purchasers of those notes pursuant to Rule\n144A(d)(4). In addition, the indentures governing the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with any provision of the Trust Indenture Act.\nA holder\u2019s ability to transfer our notes may be limited by our decision to not list the notes on a securities exchange, and an active trading market for such notes may not develop.\nWe do not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on a securities exchange or any automated dealer quotation system. We cannot assure a holder of our notes as to the liquidity of markets that may develop for the notes, such holder\u2019s ability to sell the notes or the price at which such holder would be able to sell such notes. If such markets were to exist, the notes could trade at prices that may be lower than their principal amount or purchase price depending on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our financial and operations performance and other factors. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which a holder of notes may sell its notes.", "PERMNO": 88587, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "5933B"}
