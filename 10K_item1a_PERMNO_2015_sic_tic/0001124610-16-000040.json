The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. Specific risk factors related to our status as a controlled subsidiary of EMC Corporation (\u201cEMC\u201d), including, among other things, Dell\u2019s proposed acquisition of EMC (the \u201cDell Acquisition\u201d), overlapping business opportunities, EMC's ability to control certain transactions and resource allocations and related persons\ntransactions with EMC and its other affiliated companies, are set forth below under the heading \u201cRisks Related to Our Relationship with EMC.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur success depends increasingly on customer acceptance of our emerging products and services.\nOur products and services are primarily based on server virtualization and related compute technologies used for virtualizing on-premise data center servers, which form the foundation for private cloud computing. As the market for server virtualization continues to mature, sales of our vSphere hypervisor product have begun to decline, and we are increasingly directing our product development and marketing efforts toward products and services that enable businesses to utilize virtualization as the foundation for private, public and hybrid cloud-based computing and mobile computing, including our vSphere-based software-defined data center (\u201cSDDC\u201d) products such as our management and automation and network virtualization (\u201cNSX\u201d) offerings, our Horizon client virtualization offerings, our AirWatch mobile device management offerings and our Virtual SAN (\u201cvSAN\u201d) storage virtualization offerings. We have also been introducing software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) versions of our on-premises products, including our vRealize and Horizon Suite and certain AirWatch offerings, and are working to extend our SDDC and NSX offerings into the public cloud. These initiatives present new and difficult technological and compliance challenges, and significant investments will be required to develop or acquire solutions to address those challenges. Our success depends on our current and future customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with adopting our private and hybrid cloud solutions and our client virtualization and mobile device management solutions. As the market for our server virtualization products continues to mature, and the scale of our business has increased, our rate of revenue growth increasingly depends upon the success of our newer product and service offerings. To the extent that our emerging products and services are adopted more slowly than revenue growth in our established server virtualization offerings declines, our revenue growth rates may slow materially or our revenue may decline substantially and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant decrease in demand for our server virtualization products would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe large majority of our revenues is derived, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be derived, from our server virtualization products. As more and more businesses achieve high levels of virtualization in their data centers, the market for our VMware vSphere product has matured. Additionally, as businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and may also shift some of their existing workloads to public cloud providers, thereby limiting growth, and potentially reducing, the market for on-premises deployments of VMware vSphere. Although sales of VMware vSphere have declined as a portion of our overall business, and we expect this trend to continue, VMware vSphere remains key to our future growth, as it serves as the foundation for our newer SDDC and network virtualization offerings. Although we are developing products to extend our vSphere-based SDDC offerings to the public cloud due to our product concentration, a significant decrease in demand for our server virtualization products would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face intense competition that could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe virtualization, cloud computing, end-user computing and software-defined data center industries are inter-related and rapidly evolving, and we face intense competition across all the markets for our products and services. Many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do.\nWe face competition from, among others:\nProviders of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads off-premises and may also shift some of their existing workloads. As a result, the demand for on-premises IT resources is expected to slow, and our products and services will need to increasingly compete for customers' IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based offerings. If we fail to develop products and services that address evolving customer requirements and that complement and or compete with off-premises compute resources offered by competitors, the demand for VMware\u2019s virtualization products and services may decline, and we could experience lower growth. Additionally, vCloud Air Network offerings from our partners and certain vCloud Air offerings may compete directly with infrastructure-as-a service (\u201cIaaS\u201d) offerings from various public cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft.\nLarge, diversified enterprise software and hardware companies. These competitors supply a wide variety of products and services to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small to medium sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products and services less attractive to our end users. Other competitors have limited or denied support\nfor their applications running in VMware virtualization environments. In addition, these competitors could integrate competitive capabilities into their existing products and services and make them available without additional charge. For example, Oracle provides free server virtualization software intended to support Oracle and non-Oracle applications, and Microsoft offers its own server virtualization software packaged with its Windows Server product and offers built-in virtualization in the client version of Windows. As a result, existing and prospective VMware customers may elect to use products that are perceived to be \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cvery low cost\u201d instead of purchasing VMware products and services for certain applications where they do not believe that more advanced and robust capabilities are required.\nCompanies offering competing platforms based on open source technologies. Open source technologies for virtualization, containerization and cloud platforms such as Xen, KVM, Docker, Rocket and OpenStack provide significant pricing competition and enable competing vendors to leverage these open source technologies to compete directly with our SDDC initiative. Enterprises and service providers have shown significant interest in building their own clouds based on open source projects such as OpenStack, and other companies have indicated their intention to expand offerings of virtual management and cloud computing solutions as well. Additionally, a number of enterprise IT hardware vendors have released solutions based on OpenStack including HP, IBM and Cisco.\nOther industry alliances. Many of our competitors have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive virtualization and cloud computing solutions than they individually had offered. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their positions in the evolving virtualization infrastructure and enterprise IT solutions industry. These alliances may result in more compelling product and service offerings than we offer.\nOur partners and members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. We face competition from our partners. For example, third parties currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing products and services of other vendors. Additionally, as formerly distinct sectors of enterprise IT such as software-based virtualization and hardware-based server, networking and storage solutions converge, we also increasingly compete with companies who are members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. Consequently, we may find it more difficult to continue to work together productively on other projects, and the advantages we derive from our ecosystem could diminish.\nThis competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could also prevent our new products and services from gaining market acceptance, thereby harming our ability to increase, or causing us to lose, market share.\nThe loss of key management personnel could harm our business.\nWe depend on the continued services of key management personnel. We generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our employees, and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty and could pursue employment opportunities with any of our competitors. In addition, we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key management personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for our target employees is intense and costly, and we may not be able to attract and retain highly skilled employees.\nTo execute on our strategy, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for senior sales executives and engineers with significant experience designing and developing software and cloud offerings. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. Research and development personnel are also aggressively recruited by startup and emerging growth companies, which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product and service development. Competition for our key personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation and can have a dilutive impact on our stock. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could suffer.\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The purchase of our products and services is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Weak economic conditions or significant uncertainty regarding the stability of financial markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in a number of ways, including by lengthening sales cycles, affecting the size of enterprise agreements (\u201cEAs\u201d) that customers will commit to, reducing the level of our non-EA transactional sales, lowering prices for our products and services, reducing unit sales and reducing the rate of adoption of our products and services by new customers and the willingness of current customers to purchase upgrades to\nour existing products and services. For example, a recurrence of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe or that region\u2019s failure to recover from recession would threaten to suppress demand and our customers\u2019 access to credit in that region, which is an important market for our products and services. In addition, recent economic instability in Brazil, China and Russia has adversely affected our operating results in these countries, and our operating results may be further adversely affected if this economic instability continues or spreads to neighboring markets. In response to sustained economic uncertainty, many national and local governments that are current or prospective customers for our products and services, including the U.S. federal government, have made, or threatened to make, significant spending cutbacks which could reduce the amount of government spending on IT and the potential demand for our products and services from the government sector.\nRegional economic uncertainty can also result in general and ongoing tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and significant volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services. Even if customers are willing to purchase our products and services, if they do not meet our credit requirements, we may not be able to record accounts receivable or unearned revenues or recognize revenues from these customers until we receive payment, which could adversely affect the amount of revenues we are able to recognize and our cash flows in a particular period.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes with new solutions and services offerings.\nThe virtualization, cloud computing, end-user computing and SDDC industries are characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new software product introductions and evolving industry standards. The introduction of third-party solutions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions obsolete and unmarketable. Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology that is altering the way that businesses consume, manage and provide physical IT resources, applications, data and IT services. We may not be able to establish or sustain our thought leadership in the cloud computing and enterprise software fields, and our customers may not view our products and services as innovative and best-of-breed, which could result in a reduction in market share and our inability to command a pricing premium over competitor products and services. We may not be able to develop updated products and services that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards, that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers or that interoperate with new or updated operating systems and hardware devices.\nOur ability to react quickly to new technology trends and customer requirements is negatively impacted by the length of our development cycle for new products and services and product and service enhancements, which has frequently been longer than we originally anticipated. This is due in part to the increasing complexity of our product offerings as we increase their interoperability, introduce them into product suites and maintain their compatibility with multiple IT resources utilized by our customers, which can significantly increase the development time and effort necessary to achieve the interoperability of product suite components while maintaining product quality. If we are unable to evolve our solutions and offerings in time to respond to and remain ahead of new technological developments, our ability to retain or increase market share and revenues in the virtualization, cloud computing, end-user computing and SDDC industries could be materially adversely affected. With respect to our SDDC products, if we fail to introduce compelling new features in future upgrades to our VMware vSphere product line, manage the transition to hybrid cloud platforms, develop new or tightly integrate existing applications for our virtualization technology that address customer requirements for integration, automation and management of their IT systems with public cloud resources, overall demand for products and services based on VMware vSphere may decline.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our operating results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In 2015, approximately 30% of our sales were invoiced and collected in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies. The realized gain or loss on foreign currency transactions is dependent upon the types of foreign currency transactions that we enter into, the exchange rates associated these transactions and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts, and other factors. Although we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure, a significant fluctuation in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our operating results. For example, we experienced a measurable negative impact to our revenues in 2015 due to exchange rate fluctuations, and we expect a further negative impact to 2016 revenues and unearned revenues and cash flows. The further weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would likely result in additional adverse impact on our revenues.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. In addition, a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last two weeks of the quarter, which generally reflects customer buying patterns for enterprise technology. As a result, our\nquarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline substantially.\nFactors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, among others, the factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section and the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, adoption rates, sales cycles (which have been increasing in length) and pricing levels for our products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of their purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenues in any given quarter, which can be affected by a number of factors, including product announcements, beta programs and product promotions that can cause revenue recognition of certain orders to be deferred until future products to which customers are entitled become available;\n\u2022\nthe timing of announcements or releases of new or upgraded products and services by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of business realignment plans and restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain scalable internal systems for reporting, order processing, license fulfillment, product delivery, purchasing, billing and general accounting, among other functions;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\ncredit risks of our distributors, who account for a significant portion of product revenues and accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nour ability to process sales at the end of quarter;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors such as the end of fiscal period budget expenditures by our customers and the timing of holiday and vacation periods;\n\u2022\nrenewal rates and the amounts of the renewals for EAs as original EA terms expire;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of internally developed software development costs that may be capitalized;\n\u2022\nunplanned events that could affect market perception of the quality or cost-effectiveness of our products and solutions; and\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately predict the degree to which customers will elect to purchase our subscription-based offerings in place of licenses to our on-premises offerings.\nBreaches of our cybersecurity systems could seriously harm our business.\nWe increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Unauthorized parties have penetrated our network security and our website in the past and may do so in the future. These cyberattacks threaten to misappropriate our proprietary information, cause interruptions of our IT services and commit fraud. Because the techniques used by unauthorized persons to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics. Further, if unauthorized access or sabotage remains undetected for an extended period of time, the effects of such breach could be exacerbated. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems and processes. Our exposure to cybersecurity threats and negative consequences of cybersecurity breaches will likely increase as our customers conduct more purchase and service transactions online, and we store increasing amounts of customer data and host or manage parts of customers\u2019 businesses in cloud-based IT environments.\nWe have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third parties, and we rely upon distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators to sell our products and services. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors, partners and vendors fail to protect against breaches, our ability to conduct our business could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nsensitive data regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen;\n\u2022\nour electronic communications systems, including email and other methods, could be disrupted, and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored and secured;\n\u2022\nour ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded, and our distribution channels could be disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;\n\u2022\ndefects and security vulnerabilities could be exploited or introduced into our software products or our hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and services and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents; and\n\u2022\npersonally identifiable or confidential data of our customers, employees and business partners could be stolen or lost.\nShould any of the above events occur, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers, we could face regulatory actions from governmental agencies, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised, our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed and we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\nOur international activities account for a substantial portion of our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In addition, our investment portfolio includes investments in non-U.S. financial instruments and holdings in non-U.S. financial institutions, including European institutions. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in these risk factors, our international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in delivering support, training and documentation in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products and services in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\neconomic or political instability and security concerns in countries that are important to our international sales and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transferring funds from certain countries;\n\u2022\nincreased compliance risks, particularly in emerging markets; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining appropriate controls relating to revenue recognition practices.\nFor example, recent economic instability in Brazil, China and Russia has adversely affected our operating results in these countries, and our operating results may be further adversely affected if this economic instability continues or spreads to neighboring markets. Additionally, the Chinese government is working to implement new network security standards that will require IT systems being sold into certain key sectors to be certified as \u201csecure and controllable\u201d. As part of that effort, in December 2014, standards were implemented in the banking sector requiring IT companies selling to Chinese banks to submit their software and other technology to intrusive security testing, include indigenous Chinese intellectual property and encryption technology in their software and disclose source code and other proprietary information to the Chinese government. Implementation of these standards was subsequently suspended in light of concerns communicated by banks and other parties. However, in 2015, the government has continued to enact or propose additional laws and regulations to address information and network security. For example, in July 2015, China enacted a State Security Law authorizing the government to implement a system for maintaining the security of networks and information, and it also published a draft cyber security law that proposed various specific information security and network security measures to enhance \u201ccyber sovereignty.\u201d In November 2015, the insurance regulator in China issued draft insurance cyber rules that would require insurance companies to have compliant encryption tools, secure and compliant hardware and software products, and data storage. In December 2015, China enacted an Anti-Terrorism Law that gives local public security and state security authorities the broad discretionary authority to require companies to provide access to their equipment and decryption support in particular cases. Failure to comply with such requests can result in fines and imprisonment. In addition, a broad range of businesses will be required to verify the identities of customers and prohibit the provision of services to customers whose identities are unclear or who refuse to cooperate in the verification process. If we are not able to, or choose not to, comply with these and other information and network security standards that the Chinese government might implement in the future, our business in China may suffer.\nFurthermore, if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory requirements covering the foreign activities of U.S. corporations, such as export control requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as with local regulatory requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we may be exposed to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm. These risks will increase as we expand our operations in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices.\nIn addition, potential fallout from past disclosures related to the U.S. Internet and communications surveillance and possible efforts to enable increased surveillance could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies and impair our growth rate in foreign markets.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could negatively affect our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur current research and development efforts may not produce significant revenues for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping our products and services is expensive. In particular, developing and launching disruptive technologies in new areas, as we are continuing to do with our VMware NSX virtual networking and vSAN virtual storage initiatives, requires significant investments of resources and often entails greater risk than incremental investments in existing products and services. Our investment in research and development may not result in marketable products or services or may result in products and services that generate less revenues than we anticipate. Our research and development expenses were approximately 20% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our future plans include significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. As such, despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. In addition, we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology. There is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights, in part because we rely on \u201cclick-wrap\u201d and \u201cshrink-wrap\u201d licenses in some instances.\nDetecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology proprietary rights and intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation is necessary from time to time to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, which could result in a substantial loss of our market share.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to litigation.\nMany of our products and services incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products and services in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software, which exposes us to potential liability if the software fails to work or infringes the intellectual property of a third party.\nWe monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend and avoid exposing us to unacceptable financial risk. However, the processes we follow to monitor our use of open source software could fail to achieve their intended result. In addition, although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of terms in most of these licenses, which increases the risk that a court could interpret the license differently than we do.\nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries or claims from authors or distributors of open source software included in our products regarding our compliance with the conditions of one or more open source licenses. An adverse outcome to a claim could require us to:\n\u2022\npay significant damages;\n\u2022\nstop distributing our products that contain the open source software;\n\u2022\nrevise or modify our product code to remove alleged infringing code;\n\u2022\nrelease the source code of our proprietary software; or\n\u2022\ntake other steps to avoid or remedy an alleged infringement.\nIn March 2015, a software developer who alleges that software code he wrote is used in a component of our vSphere product filed a lawsuit against us in Germany alleging copyright infringement for failing to comply with the terms of an open source license General Public License v.2 (\u201cGPL v.2\u201d) and seeking an order requiring us to comply with the GPL v.2 or cease distribution of any affected code within Germany. Although we believe that the claims in this lawsuit lack merit and intend to\nvigorously defend the lawsuit, an adverse outcome to this or other claims could have a material adverse impact on our intellectual property rights, our operating results and financial condition.\nThe evolution of our business requires more complex go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.\nOur increasing focus on developing and marketing IT management and automation and IaaS (including software-defined networking, vCloud Air, vCloud Air Network and integrated virtual desktop and mobile device) offerings that enable customers to transform their IT systems requires a greater focus on marketing and selling product suites and more holistic solutions, rather than selling on a product-by-product basis. Consequently, we have developed, and must continue to develop, new strategies for marketing and selling our offerings. Additionally, the duration of sales cycles for our offerings has increased as our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions become more complex and require additional levels of approval. In addition, marketing and selling new technologies to enterprises requires significant investment of time and resources in order to educate customers on the benefits of our new product offerings. These investments can be costly and the additional effort required to educate both customers and our own sales force can distract from their efforts to sell existing products and services.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop appropriate business and pricing models.\nIf we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends, including the industry-wide transition to cloud-based computing, our revenues could be negatively impacted. Certain of our new product initiatives, such as our vCloud Air and SaaS offerings, have a subscription model. As we increase our adoption of subscription-based pricing models for our products, we may fail to set pricing at levels appropriate to maintain our revenue streams or our customers may choose to deploy products from our competitors that they believe are priced more favorably. In addition, we may fail to accurately predict subscription renewal rates or their impact on operating results, and because revenues from subscriptions are recognized for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our results. Additionally, as customers transition to our hybrid cloud and SaaS products and services, our revenue growth rate may be adversely impacted during the period of transition as we will recognize less revenue up front than we would otherwise recognize as part of the multi-year license arrangements through which we typically sell our established offerings. Finally, as we offer more services that depend on converting users of free services to users of premium services and converting purchasers of our on-premises products to our SaaS offerings, and as such services grow in size, our ability to maintain or improve and to predict conversion rates will become more important.\nOur products and services are highly technical and may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities.\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, have contained and may contain errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been installed and used by customers. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. In the past, VMware has been made aware of public postings by hackers of portions of our source code. It is possible that the released source code could expose unknown security vulnerabilities in our products and services that could be exploited by hackers or others. We may also inherit unknown security vulnerabilities when we integrate the products or services of other companies into VMware products or services. Actual or perceived errors, defects or security vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products or services, reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products or services.\nFailure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. To the extent these products or services remain subject to a service contract with the customer, we offer to transition the customer to alternative products or services. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur success depends on the interoperability of our products and services with those of other companies.\nThe success of our products depends upon the cooperation of hardware and software vendors to ensure interoperability with our products and offer compatible products and services to end users. In addition, we intend to extend the functionality of various products to work with native public cloud applications, which may require the cooperation of public cloud vendors. To the extent that hardware, software and public cloud vendors perceive that their products and services compete with ours or those of our controlling stockholder, EMC or Dell Inc. (\u201cDell\u201d), which has signed an agreement to acquire EMC, they may have an incentive to withhold their cooperation, decline to share access or sell to us their proprietary APIs, protocols or formats, or engage in practices to actively limit the functionality, compatibility and certification of our products. In addition, vendors may fail to certify or support or continue to certify or support our products for their systems. If any of the foregoing occurs, our product development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed and it may be difficult and more costly for us to achieve\nfunctionality and service levels that would make our services attractive to end users, any of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nDisruptions to our distribution channels could harm our business.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our relationships with distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, which account for a significant portion of our revenue. Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources. Our failure to maintain good relationships with channel partners would likely lead to a loss of end users of our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenue. We generally do not have long-term contracts or minimum purchase commitments with our distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours.\nThree of our distributors each accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues during 2015. Although we believe that we have in place, or would have in place by the date of any such termination, agreements with replacement distributors sufficient to maintain our revenues from distribution, if we were to lose the distribution services of a significant distributor, such loss could have a negative impact on our operating results until such time as we arrange to replace these distribution services with the services of existing or new distributors.\nOur vCloud Air and SaaS offerings rely on third-party providers for data center space and colocation services.\nOur vCloud Air and SaaS offerings rely upon third-party providers to supply data center space, equipment maintenance and other colocation services. Although we have entered into various agreements for the lease of data center space, equipment maintenance and other services, third parties could fail to live up to the contractual obligations under those agreements. The failure of a third-party provider to prevent service disruptions, data losses or security breaches may require us to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur. Additionally, if these third-party providers fail to deliver on their obligations, our reputation could be damaged, our customers could lose confidence in us and our ability to maintain and expand our vCloud Air and SaaS offerings would be impaired.\nJoint ventures may not yield expected benefits and outcomes.\nAs we expand our offerings into new technologies such as the public cloud and seek more efficient methods of marketing our products and services in regions where local partners can operate more easily, we sometimes rely upon joint ventures with established providers of IT products and services in particular regions, for example as service providers. Joint ventures are inherently risky and the requirements for close ongoing cooperation and commitments from the joint venture partners and agreement to devote adequate resources often present significant challenges. Joint ventures can also be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that our joint ventures will achieve their intended objectives. If we are unable to continue our strategic alignment with joint venture partners or obtain the cooperation and commitments we are relying upon, our ability to successfully expand our offerings globally and in certain regions may diminish.\nSaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business.\nAs we continue to develop and offer SaaS versions of our products, we will need to continue to evolve our processes to meet a number of regulatory, intellectual property, contractual and service compliance challenges. These challenges include compliance with licenses for open source and third party software embedded in our SaaS offerings, maintaining compliance with export control and privacy regulations, including HIPAA, protecting our services from external threats, maintaining the continuous service levels and data security expected by our customers, preventing the inappropriate use of our services and adapting our go-to-market efforts.\nWe are involved in litigation and regulatory inquiries and proceedings that could negatively affect us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, which may include claims with respect to commercial, product liability, intellectual property, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower and other matters. In the ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to intellectual property infringement claims, including claims by entities that do not have operating businesses of their own and therefore limit our ability to seek counterclaims for damages and injunctive relief. In addition to monetary judgments, a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers and channel partners, which could require us to initiate or\ndefend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our customers and channel partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the use of our products. These matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of the merit of such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations.\nRefer to Note L to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain claims and litigations.\nImproper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of personal data. We collect contact and other personal or identifying information from our customers, and our customers increasingly use our services to store and process personal information and other regulated data, including protected health information subject to stringent data privacy laws. In the course of providing employee compensation and benefits, we also maintain personal data of our employees and share that information with third party payroll and benefits providers. Our hybrid cloud computing service offerings, pursuant to which we offer hybrid cloud services and enable third-party service providers to offer hybrid cloud services built on our technology, expose us to particularly significant risks. The application of U.S. and international data privacy laws to cloud computing vendors is evolving and uncertain, and our existing contractual provisions may prove to be inadequate to protect us from claims for data loss or regulatory noncompliance made against cloud computing providers who we may partner with. Any failure by us or our business partners to comply with posted privacy policies, other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy commitments contained in contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our reputation. Further, any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 data could (i) subject us to substantial damage claims, (ii) expose us to costly regulatory remediation and (iii) harm our reputation and brand.\nIf we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations, our business could be adversely affected.\nContracts with many of our customers include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with federal, state, local and non-U.S. governmental customers and our arrangements with distributors and resellers who may sell directly to governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. Any failure by us to comply with provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts. In the ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have ongoing discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations. In June 2015, we reached an agreement with the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) to pay $76 million to resolve allegations that our government sales practices between 2006 and 2013 had violated the federal False Claims Act. As set forth in the settlement agreement, VMware denied the allegations and did not admit liability. A failure in the future to comply with federal and state governmental contracting requirements could result in the termination of customer contracts, our suspension from government work, the imposition of fines or other government sanctions or an inability to compete for new contracts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAcquisitions could harm our business and operating results.\nWe have acquired in the past, and plan to acquire in the future, other businesses, products or technologies. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, which include:\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing operations, diverting management from day-to-day responsibilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business to further our business strategy;\n\u2022\nuncertainties in achieving the expected benefits of an acquisition, including enhanced revenues, technology, human resources, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other synergies;\n\u2022\nreducing cash available for operations, stock repurchase programs and other uses and resulting in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nincurring amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets acquired that could impact our operating results;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired businesses effectively;\n\u2022\ndifficulty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors;\n\u2022\nretaining and motivating key personnel from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nassuming the liabilities of the acquired business, including acquired litigation-related liabilities and regulatory compliance issues, and potential litigation or regulatory action arising from a proposed or completed acquisition;\n\u2022\nmaintaining good relationships with customers or business partners of the acquired business or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered during the diligence process, including issues with the acquired business\u2019s intellectual property, product quality, security, privacy practices, accounting practices, regulatory compliance or legal contingencies;\n\u2022\nmaintaining or establishing acceptable standards, controls, procedures or policies with respect to the acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction; and\n\u2022\nthe need to later divest acquired assets at a loss if the acquisition does not meet our expectations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe may not realize all the economic benefit from our acquisitions of other companies, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill and amortizable intangible assets were $3,993 million and $616 million, respectively. We review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may lead to impairment include a substantial decline in stock price and market capitalization or cash flows, reduced future cash flow estimates related to the assets and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nProblems with our information systems could interfere with our business and could adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders, delivering products, providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customers, fulfilling contractual obligations and otherwise running our business. If our systems fail, our disaster and data recovery planning and capacity may prove insufficient to enable timely recovery of important functions and business records. Any disruption in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we continuously work to enhance our information systems. For example, we are in the midst of a multi-year project to replace our enterprise resource planning software. The implementation of these types of enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise, which may especially be the case for us due to the size and complexity of our business. Implementation may disrupt internal controls and business processes and could introduce unintended vulnerability to error. Additionally, our information systems may not support new business models and initiatives and significant investments could be required in order to upgrade them. Any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during the implementation period, could adversely affect our business in a number of respects. Additionally, delays in adapting our information systems to address new business models could limit the success or result in the failure of such initiatives and impair the effectiveness of our internal controls. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.\nOur domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to income and indirect tax examinations. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) is currently auditing the EMC consolidated group's federal tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2011. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, a governing tax authority could have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Any assessment of additional taxes could materially affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, the impact of accounting for business combinations, changes in the composition of global earnings, the expiration of statute of limitations, settlements of audits, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of our global business, there are many intercompany transactions, including the transfer of intellectual property, where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may differ from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nOur rate of taxation in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our U.S. tax rate. Our international income is primarily earned by our subsidiaries organized in Ireland, and, as such, our effective tax rate can be impacted by the composition of our earnings in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. During October 2014, Ireland announced revisions to its tax regulations that will require foreign earnings of our subsidiaries organized in Ireland to be taxed at higher rates. We will be impacted by the changes in tax regulations in Ireland beginning in 2021, and we may proactively make structural changes that impact our tax rates prior to that date. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development issued guidelines and proposals during October 2015 that also may change how our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. These potential changes could also adversely affect our effective tax rate.\nCatastrophic events or geo-political conditions could disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or other act of God, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, and disease pandemics could temporarily sideline a substantial part of our or our customers\u2019 workforce at any particular time, any of which could disrupt our business. Furthermore, some of our new product initiatives and business functions are hosted and carried out by third parties that may be vulnerable to disruptions of these sorts, many of which may be beyond our control. Unanticipated disruptions in services provided through localized physical infrastructure, such as utility or telecommunication outages, can curtail the functioning of local offices as well as critical components of our information systems, and adversely affect our ability to process orders, provide services, respond to customer requests and maintain local and global business continuity. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the deployment or availability of our products and services, our revenues would be adversely affected. Additionally, any such catastrophic event could cause us to incur significant costs to repair damages to our facilities, equipment and infrastructure.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a significant effect on our reported results, as well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results. For example, during May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is permitted, but not earlier than the first quarter of 2017. We have not selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with EMC\nOur stock price has declined significantly since the announcement of the Dell Acquisition, and its continuing pendency and potential completion may adversely impact our business and stock price in the future.\nOn October 12, 2015, EMC and Dell announced the Dell Acquisition, pursuant to which Dell\u2019s parent company, Denali, would acquire EMC while maintaining VMware as an independent publicly traded company and issuing a tracking stock, Class V common stock, intended to reflect VMware's economic performance as partial consideration to the EMC shareholders. Upon issuance, the Class V common stock is expected to track the performance of an approximately 53% economic interest in the VMware business.\nOur stock price has declined significantly following the announcement of the Dell Acquisition and following subsequent announcements of our financial results and our guidance for future operating results. The period since the announcement of the Dell Acquisition has also coincided with a general downturn in share prices of technology companies. A number of factors relating to the Dell Acquisition could adversely affect our business or our stock price during the pendency or following the closing of the Dell Acquisition, including:\n\u2022\nIf the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali will be able to control matters requiring our stockholders\u2019 approval, including the election of a majority of our directors and the other matters over which EMC currently has control, as described in the risk factors below.\n\u2022\nFollowing the closing of the acquisition, Denali could implement changes to our business, including changing our commercial relationship with EMC or taking other corporate actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial.\n\u2022\nWe have arrangements with a number of companies that compete with Dell, and the pendency or completion of the Dell Acquisition could adversely affect our relationship with these companies or other customers, suppliers and partners.\n\u2022\nDuring the pendency of the Dell Acquisition, Denali has a right of consent to matters requiring EMC\u2019s approval under our certificate of incorporation, including acquisitions or investments in excess of $100 million, and Denali may choose not to consent to matters that our board of directors and EMC believe are in the best interests of VMware.\n\u2022\nWe anticipate certain synergies and benefits from the Dell Acquisition that may not be realized.\n\u2022\nThe Class V common stock to be issued by Denali, while not a VMware issued security, would increase the supply of publicly traded securities that track VMware's economic performance and could create the perception that the Class V common stock dilutes the holdings of our public stockholders, both of which could put downward pressure on our stock price.\n\u2022\nFollowing the closing of the Dell Acquisition, Denali will be highly leveraged and may be required to commit a substantial portion of its cash flows to servicing its indebtedness. While Denali has publicly stated that it plans to leave VMware free to use its cash to invest in the VMware business, Denali\u2019s significant debt could create the perception that Denali may exercise its control over us to limit our growth in favor of its other businesses or cause us to transfer cash to Denali. In addition, if Denali defaults, or appears in danger of defaulting, on its indebtedness, the trading price of the Class V common stock issued by Denali would be adversely affected, which could negatively impact the price of our Class A common stock, and uncertainty as to the impact of such a default on VMware could disrupt our business.\n\u2022\nSome of our products compete directly with products sold or distributed by Dell, which could result in reduced sales during the pendency or following the closing of the Dell Acquisition.\n\u2022\nThe pendency of the Dell Acquisition creates uncertainty for our employees, which could make it difficult to attract and retain employees.\n\u2022\nThe pendency of the Dell Acquisition could distract management\u2019s focus from executing on other strategic initiatives.\n\u2022\nWith respect to our stock repurchase program, we are currently subject to a number of legal and regulatory constraints resulting from Dell's proposed acquisition of EMC, which impacts the timing and ability to execute repurchases of our shares and may continue to curtail our ability to repurchase our shares throughout the pendency of the Dell Acquisition.\n\u2022\nThe Dell Acquisition creates potential litigation risk. Various lawsuits have been filed against EMC and others in connection with the Dell Acquisition, including one in which the Company and our directors are named as defendants. It is possible that we or our Company's directors may be named in other lawsuits.\nHolders of our Class A common stock have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2015, EMC owned 43,025,000 shares of our Class A common stock and all 300,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock, representing 81.3% of the total outstanding shares of common stock or 97.5% of the voting power of outstanding common stock. Through its ownership of the Class B common stock, which is generally entitled to 10 votes per share, EMC controls the vote to elect all of our directors and to approve or disapprove all other matters submitted to a stockholder vote.\nPrior to a distribution by EMC to its stockholders under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (a \u201c355 Distribution\u201d), shares of Class B common stock transferred to any party other than a successor-in-interest (such as Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) or a subsidiary of EMC automatically convert into Class A common stock. EMC\u2019s voting\ncontrol over VMware will continue so long as the shares of Class B common stock it owns continue to represent at least 20% of our outstanding stock. If EMC\u2019s ownership falls below 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert to Class A common stock. If EMC effects a 355 Distribution at a time when it holds shares of Class B common stock, its shareholders will receive Class B common stock. These shares will remain entitled to 10 votes per share, holders of these shares will remain entitled to elect 80% of the total number of directors on our board of directors and the holders of our Class A common stock will continue to have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and have limited ability to elect members of our board of directors. Following a 355 distribution, shares of Class B common stock may convert to Class A common stock if such conversion is approved by VMware stockholders after the 355 distribution and we have obtained a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. In January 2014, the IRS announced in Revenue Procedure 2014-3 that, generally, it would no longer issue private letter rulings on 355 distributions.\nEMC has the ability to prevent us from taking actions that might be in our best interest.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation and the master transaction agreement we entered into with EMC, we must (subject to certain exceptions) obtain the consent of EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed), as the holder of our Class B common stock, prior to taking specified actions, such as acquiring other companies for consideration in excess of $100 million, issuing stock or other VMware securities, except pursuant to employee benefit plans (provided that we obtain Class B common stockholder approval of the aggregate annual number of shares to be granted under such plans), paying dividends, entering into any exclusive or exclusionary arrangement with a third party involving, in whole or in part, products or services that are similar to EMC\u2019s or amending certain provisions of our charter documents. In addition, we have agreed that for so long as EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) continues to own greater than 50% of the voting control of our outstanding common stock, we will not knowingly take or fail to take any action that could reasonably be expected to preclude the ability of EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) to undertake a tax-free spin-off. Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, or another acquirer or successor, if the Dell Acquisition is not completed and EMC is subsequently acquired or otherwise undergoes a change of control, will be entitled to exercise the voting control and contractual rights of EMC, and may do so in a manner that could vary significantly from EMC\u2019s historic practice. If EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) does not provide any requisite consent allowing us to conduct such activities when requested, we will not be able to conduct such activities. As a result, we may have to forgo capital raising or acquisition opportunities that would otherwise be available to us, and we may be precluded from pursuing certain growth initiatives.\nBy becoming a stockholder in our company, holders of our Class A common stock are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the master transaction agreement with respect to the limitations that are described above.\nEMC has the ability to prevent a change in control transaction and may sell control of VMware without benefiting other stockholders.\nEMC\u2019s voting control and its additional rights described above gives EMC (or Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) the ability to prevent transactions that would result in a change of control of VMware, including transactions in which holders of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. In addition, EMC (or Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party and may do so without the approval of the holders of our Class A common stock and without providing for a purchase of any shares of Class A common stock held by persons other than EMC. Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if EMC did not maintain voting control over us or if EMC did not have the additional rights described above.\nIf EMC\u2019s level of ownership significantly increases, EMC (or Denali, if the Dell acquisition is completed) could unilaterally effect a merger of VMware into EMC without a vote of VMware stockholders or the VMware board of directors at a price per share that might not reflect a premium to then-current market prices.\nAs of December 31, 2015, EMC held approximately 81.3% of VMware\u2019s outstanding common stock, and EMC\u2019s percentage ownership of VMware common stock could increase as a result of repurchases by VMware of our Class A common stock or purchases by EMC (or Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed). Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a parent company, when it owns 90% or more of each class of a subsidiary's stock that generally would be entitled to vote on a merger of that subsidiary with the parent, to unilaterally effect a merger of the subsidiary into the parent without a vote of the subsidiary's board or stockholders. Accordingly, if EMC or Denali (after the Dell Acquisition is completed) becomes the holder of at least 90% of VMware\u2019s outstanding stock, neither VMware's board of directors nor VMware\u2019s stockholders would be entitled to vote on a merger of VMware into Denali (the \u201cshort-form merger\u201d). Moreover, a short-form merger is not subject to the stringent \u201centire fairness\u201d standard and the parent company is not required to negotiate with a special committee of disinterested directors that would serve to approximate arm's length negotiations designed to ensure that a fair price is\npaid. Rather, a minority stockholder\u2019s sole remedy in the context of a short-form merger is to exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. In such a proceeding, petitioning stockholders may be awarded more or less than the merger price or the amount they would have received in a merger negotiated between the parent and a disinterested special committee advised by independent financial and legal advisors. Denali has publicly stated that from the completion of the Dell Acquisition through the two-year anniversary of its completion, it will not acquire any shares of common stock of VMware if such acquisition would cause the common stock of VMware to no longer be publicly traded on a U.S. securities exchange or VMware to no longer be required to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, unless such acquisition of VMware common stock is required in order for VMware to continue to be a member of the affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated tax return with Denali.\nWe engage in related persons transactions with EMC that may divert our resources, create opportunity costs and prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe currently engage in a number of related persons transactions with EMC (and, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, we may in the future engage in related persons transactions with Dell) that include joint product development, go-to-market, branding, sales, customer service activities, real estate and various support services. Additionally, we contributed technology and transferred employees to Pivotal Software, Inc. (\u201cPivotal\u201d) in 2013 and continue to hold a significant ownership interest in Pivotal. For more information, refer to Note N to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 and \u201cOur Relationship with EMC\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual report on Form 10-K, and \u201cTransactions with Related Persons\u201d in the proxy statement for our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders.\nWe believe that these related persons transactions provide us a unique opportunity to leverage the respective technical expertise, product strengths and market presence of EMC and its subsidiaries for the benefit of our customers and stockholders while enabling us to compete more effectively with competitors who are much larger than us. However, these transactions (or other transactions we may enter into with Dell if the Dell Acquisition is completed) may prove not to be successful and may divert our resources or the attention of our management from other opportunities. Negotiating and implementing these arrangements can be time consuming and cause delays in the introduction of joint product and service offerings and disruptions to VMware's business. We cannot predict whether our stockholders and industry or securities analysts who cover us will react positively to announcements of new related persons transactions with EMC, and such announcements could have a negative impact on our stock price. Our participation in these transactions may also cause certain of our other vendors and ecosystem partners who compete with EMC and its subsidiaries (or, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali and its subsidiaries) to also view us as their competitors. Additionally, if Pivotal requires additional funding, we may be asked to contribute capital resources to Pivotal or accept dilution in our ownership interest, and we may be unable to realize any value from the technology and resources that we contributed to Pivotal.\nOur business and EMC\u2019s business overlap, and EMC and Dell may compete with us, which could reduce our market share.\nWe and EMC are IT infrastructure companies providing products and services that overlap in various areas, including software-based storage, hyper-converged infrastructure products and cloud computing services. Dell, which will indirectly control our company if the Dell Acquisition is completed, also provides products and services that overlap with ours in various areas, including in management and hyper-converged infrastructure products. EMC and Dell compete with us in these areas now and may engage in increased competition with us in the future. In addition, the intellectual property agreement that we have entered into with EMC provides EMC the ability to use our source code and intellectual property, which, subject to limitations, it may use to produce certain products that compete with ours. EMC\u2019s rights in this regard extend to its majority-owned subsidiaries, which could include joint ventures where EMC holds a majority position and one or more of our competitors hold minority positions.\nEMC or, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali could assert control over us in a manner that could impede our growth or our ability to enter new markets or otherwise adversely affect our business. Further, EMC or, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali could utilize its control over us to cause us to take or refrain from taking certain actions, including entering into relationships with channel, technology and other marketing partners, enforcing our intellectual property rights or pursuing business combinations, other corporate opportunities (which EMC is expressly permitted to pursue under the circumstances set forth in our certificate of incorporation) or product development initiatives that could adversely affect our competitive position, including our competitive position relative to that of EMC and Dell in markets where we compete with them. In addition, EMC and Dell maintain significant partnerships with certain of our competitors, including Microsoft.\nEMC\u2019s and Dell's competition in certain markets may affect our ability to build and maintain partnerships.\nOur existing and potential partner relationships may be negatively affected by our relationship with EMC and the pendency of the Dell Acquisition. We partner with a number of companies that compete with EMC or Dell in certain markets in which EMC or Dell participate. EMC\u2019s majority ownership in us, and Denali's potential majority ownership in us if the Dell\nAcquisition is completed, may affect our ability to effectively partner with these companies. These companies may favor our competitors because of our relationship with EMC and our potential relationship with Dell.\nEMC and Dell compete with certain of our significant channel, technology and other marketing partners, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and other agreements that we have with EMC, EMC and, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Dell may have the ability to impact our relationship with those of our partners that compete with EMC or Dell, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to pursue opportunities which may otherwise be available to us.\nWe could be held liable for the tax liabilities of other members of EMC\u2019s consolidated tax group.\nWe have historically been included in EMC\u2019s consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as in certain consolidated, combined or unitary groups that include EMC Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries for state and local income tax purposes. Pursuant to our agreement with EMC, we and EMC generally will make payments to each other such that, with respect to tax returns for any taxable period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are included in EMC\u2019s consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other consolidated, combined or unitary group of EMC Corporation or its subsidiaries, the amount of taxes to be paid by us will be determined, subject to certain consolidated return adjustments, as if we and each of our subsidiaries included in such consolidated, combined or unitary group filed our own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return. When we become subject to federal income tax audits as a member of EMC's consolidated group, the tax sharing agreement provides that EMC has authority to control the audit and represent EMC and VMware's interests to the IRS. Accordingly, if we and EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) differ on appropriate responses and positions to take with respect to tax questions that may arise in the course of an audit, our ability to affect the outcome of such audits may be impaired. In addition, if EMC effects a 355 Distribution or other transaction that is subsequently determined to be taxable, VMware could be liable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have been included in the EMC consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our acquisition by EMC, and expect to continue to be included in such consolidated group for periods in which EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) owns at least 80% of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock. Each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, each member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group for state, local or foreign income tax purposes is jointly and severally liable for the state, local or foreign income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated, combined or unitary group. Accordingly, for any period in which we are included in the EMC consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any other consolidated, combined or unitary group of EMC Corporation and its subsidiaries, we could be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred, but not discharged, by any other member of any such group.\nWe are still evaluating the potential impact of the pending Dell Acquisition on our tax sharing agreement with EMC and expect to amend the agreement following or in conjunction with the completion of the acquisition. If the pending Dell Acquisition is completed and it is subsequently determined that the tracking stock issued in connection with the Dell Acquisition constitutes a taxable distribution, VMware could be liable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have limited ability to resolve favorably any disputes that arise between us and EMC.\nDisputes may arise between EMC and us in a number of areas relating to our ongoing relationships, including our reseller, technology and other business agreements with EMC, areas of competitive overlap, strategic initiatives, requests for consent to activities specified in our certificate of incorporation and the terms of our intercompany agreements. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed), and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nThe agreements we enter into with EMC may be amended upon agreement between the parties, and then in some cases only with the consent of Denali under the terms of the Dell Acquisition Agreement. While we are controlled by EMC and during the pendency of the Dell Acquisition, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to these agreements if required on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party, if at all.\nOur CEO, our future CFO and some of our directors have potential conflicts of interest with EMC.\nOur CEO, our future CFO and some of our directors own EMC common stock or equity awards to purchase EMC common stock that will accelerate upon completion of the Dell Acquisition. In addition, some of our directors are executive officers or directors of EMC, and EMC, as the sole holder of our Class B common stock, is entitled to elect 7 of our 8 directors. Ownership of EMC common stock and equity awards to purchase EMC common stock by our directors and the presence of executive officers or directors of EMC on our board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with\nrespect to matters involving both us and EMC that could have different implications for EMC than they do for us. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the master transaction agreement between EMC and us address corporate opportunities that are presented to our directors or officers that are also directors or officers of EMC. These provisions may not adequately address potential conflicts of interest or ensure that potential conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. As a result, we may not be able to take advantage of corporate opportunities presented to individuals who are officers or directors of both us and EMC or, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali, and we may be precluded from pursuing certain growth initiatives.\nEMC\u2019s ability to control our board of directors may make it difficult for us to recruit independent directors.\nSo long as EMC or, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali beneficially owns shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting stock, EMC or, if the Dell Acquisition is completed, Denali can effectively control and direct our board of directors. Further, the interests of EMC, Denali and our other stockholders may diverge. Under these circumstances, persons who might otherwise accept our invitation to join our board of directors may decline.\nOur historical financial information as a majority-owned subsidiary of EMC may not be representative of the results of a completely independent public company.\nThe financial information covering the periods included in this report does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been a completely independent entity during those periods. In certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity, we contract with EMC subsidiaries for support services and EMC personnel who are managed by us. The costs incurred by EMC on our behalf related to these employees are passed on to us and we are charged a mark-up intended to approximate costs that would have been charged had we contracted for such services with an unrelated third party. These costs are included as expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Additionally, we and EMC engage in intercompany transactions, including agreements regarding the use of EMC\u2019s and our intellectual property and real estate, agreements regarding the sale of goods and services to one another and to Pivotal, and an agreement for EMC to resell our products and services to third party customers. If EMC were to distribute its shares of our common stock to its stockholders or otherwise divest itself of all or a significant portion of its VMware shares, there would be numerous implications to VMware, including the fact that VMware could lose the benefit of these arrangements with EMC. There can be no assurance that VMware would be able to renegotiate these arrangements with EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) or replace them on the same or similar terms. Additionally, our business could face significant disruption and uncertainty as we transition from these arrangements with EMC. Moreover, our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our financial condition, operating results or cash flows will be in the future if and when we contract at arm\u2019s length with independent third parties for the services we have received and currently receive from EMC. During 2015, we recognized revenues of $428 million, and as of December 31, 2015, $306 million of sales were included in unearned revenues from such transactions with EMC. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Class A Common Stock\nThe price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future due to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report. In particular, our stock price declined significantly following the announcement of the Dell Acquisition and following subsequent announcements of financial results and our guidance for future operating results. The period since the announcement of the Dell Acquisition has also coincided with a general downturn in share prices of technology companies. Future announcements concerning these matters, as well as continuing volatility in technology company share prices, could also lead to volatility in our stock price.\nEMC, which holds 81.3% of our outstanding stock is not restricted from selling its shares and is entitled to certain registration rights. If a significant number of shares enters the public trading markets in a short period of time, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. In addition, if our Class B common stock is distributed to EMC stockholders and remains outstanding, it would trade separately from and potentially at a premium to our Class A common stock, and could thereby contribute additional volatility to the price of our Class A common stock.\nBroad market and industry factors may also decrease the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general and technology companies in particular have often experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Our public float is also relatively small due to EMC\u2019s holdings, which can result in greater volatility in our stock compared to that of other companies with a market capitalization similar to ours. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class\naction litigation has often been instituted, including against us, and, if not resolved swiftly, can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our charter documents could discourage takeover attempts.\nAs our controlling stockholder, EMC has the ability to prevent a change in control of VMware. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at any annual meeting;\n\u2022\nthe right of the Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nfollowing a 355 Distribution of Class B common stock by EMC to its stockholders, the restriction that a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our Class B common stock may not vote in any election of directors unless such person or group also owns at least an equivalent percentage of Class A common stock or obtains approval of our board of directors prior to acquiring beneficial ownership of at least 5% of Class B common stock;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors or any other matters, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with terms set by the Board of Directors, which rights could be senior to those of common stock; and\n\u2022\nin the event that EMC or its successor-in-interest (including Denali, if the Dell Acquisition is completed) no longer owns shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors, stockholders may not act by written consent and may not call special meetings of the stockholders.\nIn addition, we have elected to apply the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92257, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "VMW"}
