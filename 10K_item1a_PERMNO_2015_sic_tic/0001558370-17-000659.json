{"cik": "820313", "company": "AMPHENOL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control financial enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company\u2019s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nThe Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.\nApproximately 50% of the Company\u2019s 2016 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 14% of the Company\u2019s 2016 net sales coming from sales to the mobile device market. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change (see below-\u201cThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth\u201d). These markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, there has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 6% and 9% of the Company\u2019s 2016 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company\u2019s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company\u2019s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their\naccess to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.\nChanges in defense expenditures may reduce the Company\u2019s sales.\nApproximately 9% of the Company\u2019s 2016 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The substantial majority of these sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. The Company\u2019s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.\nThe Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the Company\u2019s existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth.\nThe Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 20% of 2016 net sales. The Company\u2019s long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line concepts. If the Company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the Company\u2019s new products are not met with market acceptance, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s credit agreements contain certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2016, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and a syndicate of financial institutions (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), which also backstops the Company\u2019s commercial paper program, contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company\u2019s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Company\u2019s credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, the Company may not have sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the commercial paper program of nil and $1,018.9 million, respectively.\nThe Company relies on the capital markets, and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. While the Company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or\ncash flows. In addition, while the Company has not encountered any such issues to date, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company\u2019s debt were to downgrade the Company\u2019s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the Company\u2019s performance, it would likely increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors the mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as the mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2016, $1,024.4 million, or 34%, of the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had the following unsecured Senior Notes outstanding:\nA 10% change in LIBOR or floating interest rates at December 31, 2016 would not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2017, although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales, gross margins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company\u2019s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to the risks of political, economic and military instability in countries outside the United States.\nNon-U.S. markets account for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s business. During 2016, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 72% of the Company\u2019s net sales, with China constituting approximately 30% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company\u2019s customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. Because the Company has extensive non-U.S. operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the U.S., it is exposed to risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, including:\n\u00b7\ntariffs, trade barriers, trade disputes, trade sanctions, trade agreements or any other changes in trade policies or trade agreements;\n\u00b7\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u00b7\ntax issues, such as tax law changes, audits and examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country as compared to the U.S. and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u00b7\ncredit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nemployment regulations and local labor conditions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u00b7\ninstability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, foreign currency exchange restrictions and devaluations, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, particularly in emerging markets; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.\nThe Company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisition of FCI on January 8, 2016. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. The Company may experience difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with integrating such acquisitions, and the acquisitions may not perform as expected. At December 31, 2016, the total assets of the Company were $8,498.7 million, which included $3,678.8 million of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired). The Company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill. Such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company\u2019s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels.\nThe Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare earth metals and plastic resins, in its manufacturing processes. Volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such materials. In addition, to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements, the Company\u2019s margins may decline.\nOur business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.\nSeveral anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies from engaging in improper conduct for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or improving business. Such acts may include, but are not limited to, bribery, conflicts of interest, fraud, kickbacks and money laundering. While the Company\u2019s internal controls and systems are designed to protect it from illegal acts committed by employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners that may violate U.S. or local jurisdictional laws, there are no guarantees that such internal controls and systems will always protect the Company from such acts. Such violations or allegations could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, lead to criminal or civil investigations in the U.S. or foreign\njurisdictions, and ultimately result in monetary or non-monetary penalties and/or significant legal and administrative fees. Any significant violations of our standards of conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings that could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, including but not limited to, claims related to employment, tax, intellectual property, environmental, sales practices, workers compensation, product warranty, product liability and acquisitions. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in significant legal expenses. While the Company does maintain insurance coverage to mitigate losses associated with some of these types of proceedings, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities.\nCybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially lead to litigation.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats to the Company could lead to unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and the misappropriation, destruction, or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary technological information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third party service providers. Despite the Company\u2019s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from a cybersecurity incident, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures, natural disasters or catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage and litigation with third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. The following factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows:\n\u00b7\na global economic slowdown in any of the Company\u2019s market segments;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty about global, regional and U.S. economic or geopolitical conditions that result in postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures;\n\u00b7\nrapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers;\n\u00b7\nintergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars and acts of terrorism or war;\n\u00b7\ninterruptions to the Company\u2019s business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions, inventory excesses, natural disasters or other disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or explosions;\n\u00b7\nincreases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company\u2019s benefit plans.", "PERMNO": 84769, "SIC": 3678, "TIC": "APH"}
