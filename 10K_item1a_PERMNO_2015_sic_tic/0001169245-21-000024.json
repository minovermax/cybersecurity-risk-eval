Risk Factors.\nThe following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making a decision to invest in our common stock. These risks are more fully described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including the following:\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to adversely impact our business and operations, including our clinical trials.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022We will need substantial additional funding to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.\n\u2022The auditor's opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph relating to our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ if we do not remedy such going concern condition within the periods specified in the agreement and our ability to share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab will be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022If we receive regulatory approval for bentracimab, or if the SFJ Agreement is terminated, we will be required to make substantial payments to SFJ pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. If we do not have sufficient funding or cash flow from our business to meet our payment obligations under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ could exercise its remedies as a holder of a first-priority security interest in our assets and our business could be materially harmed.\n\u2022We currently have only two clinical-stage product candidates, bentracimab, a ticagrelor reversal agent, and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH. If we are unable to successfully develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates for these or any other indications, or successfully develop any other product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.\n\u2022Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to seek regulatory approval of bentracimab in the United States through an accelerated approval process. If we are not successful with this process, the development and commercialization of bentracimab could be delayed, abandoned or significantly more costly.\n\u2022Success in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials.\n\u2022As an organization, we have never completed pivotal clinical trials, and we may be unable to do so for any product candidates we may develop.\n\u2022ELP is a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time, risks and cost of development and the ability to subsequently obtain regulatory approval of our ELP product candidates.\n\u2022We may not be successful in our efforts to increase our pipeline of product candidates, including by pursuing additional indications for our current product candidates or in-licensing or acquiring additional product candidates for other diseases.\n\u2022Market acceptance of bentracimab, if approved, will depend heavily on the continued market acceptance and use of ticagrelor.\n\u2022We contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab and pemziviptadil for preclinical and clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\n\u2022If we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to any of our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our obligations in our current and future intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to adversely impact our business and operations, including our clinical trials.\nOur business operations are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic. The U.S., state and local governments have imposed travel and other restrictions in order to reduce the spread of the disease, including state and local orders across the United States that, among other things, direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings and events and order cessation of non-essential travel. In response to public health directives and orders, we have implemented work-from-home policies for all employees.\nWe may experience disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022delays, difficulties or a suspension in enrolling patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials;\n\u2022delays, difficulties or a suspension in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022interruptions in our ability to manufacture and deliver drug supply for trials;\n\u2022diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, and the ability or willingness of subjects to travel to trial sites due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others; and\n\u2022limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people.\nFor our clinical trials that are planned to be conducted at sites in countries that are experiencing heightened impact from COVID-19, in addition to the risks listed above, we may also experience the following adverse impacts:\n\u2022delays in receiving approvals from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product used in our clinical trials;\n\u2022changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; and\n\u2022refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in these affected geographies.\nAs we advance our clinical programs for bentracimab and pemziviptadil with site activations and patient enrollment, we remain in close contact with our clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 may have on our clinical trials and current timelines and to consider whether we can\nimplement appropriate mitigating measures to help to lessen such impacts. At this time, however, we cannot currently fully forecast the scope of impacts that COVID-19 may have on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results.\nWe have commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial for bentracimab and are currently working to identify and initiate additional clinical sites for this study, although the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the pace of site initiation and patient enrollment, including the types of patients enrolling in the trial. We expect to complete enrollment of the first 100 patients in the REVERSE-IT trial in mid-2021, and are targeting to submit our BLA for bentracimab in mid-2022, although those timelines could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith respect to our pemziviptadil program, we have resumed enrollment of new patients in our Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of PAH after having previously paused enrollment temporarily as a precaution to minimize potential exposure of this patient population at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19. We are targeting to report the top-line results of this trial in the second half of 2021, although that timeline could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, remote work policies, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact productivity, disrupt our ongoing research and development activities and impact our operations, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations and their effect on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. In addition, although our employees are accustomed to working remotely, changes in internal controls due to remote work arrangements could potentially result in control deficiencies in the preparation of our financial reports, which could be significant.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has had a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the continued duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a continued and growing pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business and clinical trials will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the geographic distribution of the disease over time, the continued duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including the efficacy and availability of vaccines and antiviral agents against the disease. Accordingly, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical and regulatory activities, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these impacts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. Our net loss was $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $260.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds raised in our initial public offering, private placements of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock and borrowings under our term loan. In future periods we expect SFJ to provide up to $72.9 million of funding pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, $30.0 million of which we are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones with respect to our clinical development of bentracimab. We have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to the development of our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our proprietary half-life extending elastin-like polypeptide, or ELP, technology, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. We expect that it could be several years, if ever, before we have a commercialized product. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022continue our ongoing clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials, as needed;\n\u2022seek to expand our geographical reach through the SFJ Agreement and the corresponding clinical development support fees that we will incur;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH;\n\u2022develop PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension;\n\u2022seek to discover and develop additional clinical and preclinical product candidates;\n\u2022scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities;\n\u2022establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including bentracimab and pemziviptadil;\n\u2022adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;\n\u2022add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing product candidates that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval, and manufacturing, marketing and selling any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, as well as discovering and developing additional product candidates. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate any revenue or revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain product approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing products, which may make it difficult for an investor to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe commenced operations in 2002, and our operations to date have been largely focused on raising capital and developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our proprietary ELP half-life extending technology, including undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials. To date, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete pivotal clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a product on a commercial scale, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing products.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. We will need to develop commercial capabilities, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nWe will need substantial additional funding to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes\nyears to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years as we complete our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates, initiate future clinical trials of our product candidates, seek marketing approval for bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH, develop PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension and advance any of our other product candidates we may develop or otherwise acquire. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for a number of years, if at all. If we obtain marketing approval for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates that we develop or otherwise acquire, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We also expect an increase in our expenses associated with creating additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations and, as of December 31, 2020, had an accumulated deficit of $260.7 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $28.1 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, in addition to the $42.9 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses that we expect SFJ will fund or reimburse pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for 12 months from the date of the issuance of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the progress and results of our ongoing and planned future clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil and our development of PB6440 and other preclinical programs;\n\u2022the timing and amount of any payments we receive under the SFJ Agreement, and our ability to comply with our capitalization requirements under the SFJ Agreement;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any future product candidates we may decide to pursue;\n\u2022the extent to which we develop, in-license or acquire other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the amount of revenues, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022our ability to establish collaborations to commercialize pemziviptadil in the United States;\n\u2022our ability to establish collaborations to commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any of our other product candidates outside the United States; and\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.\nWe will require additional capital to commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil and PB6440. If we receive regulatory approval for any of these product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution depending on where we choose to commercialize. Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. Further, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, government or private party grants, debt financings and license and collaboration agreements.\nExcept with respect to the funding obligations pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, we do not currently have any other committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. For example, under the SFJ Agreement, we granted SFJ a first-priority security interest in all of our assets related to bentracimab, subject only to the lien of SVB and WestRiver, or the Lenders, for existing indebtedness to the Lenders. In connection with the grant of the security interest, we agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt or enter into licensing transactions with respect to intellectual property related to bentracimab. Similarly, our loan and security agreement with the Lenders is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our current and future assets. We are also obligated to comply with various other customary covenants, including restrictions on our ability to encumber our intellectual property assets. The security interests granted to SFJ and the Lenders may preclude future debt financing or make the terms of such financings less favorable.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or commit to future payment streams. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe auditor's opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph relating to our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ if we do not remedy such going concern condition within the periods specified in the agreement and our ability to share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe auditor's opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Under the SFJ Agreement, if we fail to remedy such going concern condition during the periods specified in the agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ. We have multiple quarters in which to remedy the going concern condition, including by restructuring our costs and operations, raising additional capital in financing or strategic transactions or accepting additional financing from SFJ on the same terms as their original commitment (which additional financing they have the option, but not obligation, to provide). Although we believe that the cure periods in the SFJ Agreement are sufficient to enable us to remedy the going concern condition, if we are unable to do so and if our business related to bentracimab is transferred to SFJ as a result, we will not share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab until SFJ has received a 300% return on its investment in bentracimab, after which we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the United States and certain European countries, and after SFJ has received an aggregate 500% return on its investment in bentracimab, we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the rest of the world.\nWhile we believe that we will be able to raise the capital we need to continue our operations and to remedy the going concern condition pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts or will be able to generate sufficient liquidity or eliminate our operating losses. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we would need to significantly scale back our expenditures and thereby reduce our operating plans and curtail some or all of our product development, commercialization and strategic plans, and our ability to share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab will be materially and adversely affected, each of which would similarly materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for bentracimab, or if the SFJ Agreement is terminated, we will be required to make substantial payments to SFJ pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. If we do not have sufficient funding or cash flow from our\nbusiness to meet our payment obligations under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ could exercise its remedies as a holder of a first-priority security interest in our assets and our business could be materially harmed.\nOn January 9, 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ agreed to provide up to $120.0 million to support the global development of bentracimab. If we receive regulatory approval for bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, we will be required to make substantial payments to SFJ pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. Our ability to make these required payments will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to meet our obligations under the SFJ Agreement. If we are unable to generate such cash flow or to obtain additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources on acceptable terms or at all, we could default on our payment obligations to SFJ. We have granted SFJ a first-priority security interest in all of our assets related to bentracimab, subject only to the lien of the Lenders for existing indebtedness to the Lenders. If we are unable to meet our payment obligations to SFJ, SFJ may exercise its remedies as a holder of a first-priority security interest, which would result in a loss of our assets and our business would be materially harmed.\nIn addition, in the event that (i) we fail to pay any amounts payable to SFJ under the SFJ Agreement within a specified time period, (ii) we are in default of our obligations (subject to certain exclusions) under the MedImmune License or (iii) either (a) we determine it is probable that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that our financial statements for the then-current quarter are issued, or available to be issued or (b) a \u201cgoing concern\u201d footnote is included in any of our financial statements, and, in either case ((a) or (b)), we fail to remedy such going concern condition as specified in the agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ. We have multiple quarters in which to remedy the going concern condition, including by restructuring our costs and operations, raising additional capital in financing or strategic transactions or accepting additional financing from SFJ on the same terms as their original commitment (which additional financing they have the option, but not obligation, to provide). Although we believe that the cure periods in the SFJ Agreement are sufficient to enable us to remedy the going concern condition, if we are unable to do so and if our business related to bentracimab is transferred to SFJ, we will not share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab until SFJ has received a 300% return on its investment in bentracimab, after which we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the United States and certain European countries, and after SFJ has received an aggregate 500% return on its investment in bentracimab, we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the rest of the world. See \u201c-The auditor's opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph relating to our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ if we do not remedy such going concern condition within the periods specified in the agreement and our ability to share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab will be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nIn the event that the SFJ Agreement is terminated, we will be obligated to make substantial payments to SFJ. If following termination of the SFJ Agreement we continue to develop bentracimab and obtain BLA approval in the United States, the European Union, Japan or China, we will be obligated to pay applicable approval payments for any such jurisdiction to SFJ as if the SFJ Agreement had not been terminated, less any payments made upon termination, except in limited circumstances. Further, if our business related to SFJ is transferred to SFJ in the event that we breach certain provisions of the SFJ Agreement, we will not share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab until SFJ has received an at least 300% return on its investment in bentracimab. See \u201cBusiness - License, Co-Development and Other Agreements - Co-Development Agreement for bentracimab with SFJ Pharmaceuticals.\u201d Such payment obligations could have significant consequences for our stockholders and our business, results of operations and financial condition and could force us to delay or terminate development of bentracimab or other product candidates.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates\nWe currently have only two clinical-stage product candidates, bentracimab, a ticagrelor reversal agent, and pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH. If we are unable to successfully develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates for these or any other indications, or successfully develop any other product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.\nWe currently have no products that are approved for commercial sale. We currently have only two clinical-stage product candidates, bentracimab and pemziviptadil. To date, we have not yet completed any pivotal clinical trials. We have not completed the development of any product candidates, and we may never be able to develop marketable products.\nWe have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our clinical and preclinical product candidates and our proprietary ELP technology. Our ability to generate revenue from our product candidates, which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates that we develop or otherwise may acquire will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022timely and successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022successful enrollment, including with respect to the various indications for which we might seek approval of bentracimab, and completion of clinical trials;\n\u2022with respect to bentracimab, the success of our collaboration with SFJ;\n\u2022successful development of, or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, our commercial manufacturing processes for any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022receipt of timely marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022launching commercial sales of products, if approved;\n\u2022acceptance of our products, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, for their approved indications;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates;\n\u2022the availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative therapies for any product candidate, and any indications for such product candidate, that we develop, specifically, alternative reversal agents or antiplatelet therapies to ticagrelor (including therapies that may be developed with a reversal agent), or alternative treatments for PAH or treatment-resistant hypertension;\n\u2022our ability to produce bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates we develop on a commercial scale;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and complying effectively with other procedures; and\n\u2022maintaining a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of the products following approval.\nIf we are not successful with respect to one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize the product candidates we develop, which would materially harm our business. If we do not receive marketing approvals for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate we develop, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are not able to obtain required regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval or other marketing authorizations by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, and it typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, and the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Bentracimab and pemziviptadil are currently our only clinical-stage product candidates. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that we may never obtain regulatory approval for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future. Neither we nor any current or future collaborator is permitted to market any drug product candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of a BLA, or a new drug application, or NDA, from the FDA. To date, we have only had limited discussions with the EMA and other comparable foreign authorities regarding regulatory approval for bentracimab, pemziviptadil or any other product candidate outside of the United States.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize any drug product candidate in the United States or abroad, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates are safe, pure and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or after approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development programs.\nOf the large number of products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval and marketing authorization process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval and marketing authorization to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of our clinical and preclinical product candidates, including bentracimab, pemziviptadil and PB6440. Our business is dependent on our ability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, successfully commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and any future product candidates in a timely manner.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of a BLA, NDA or foreign marketing application for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval or other marketing authorization contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including post-marketing clinical trials. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve or authorize for marketing a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally request, and the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve or authorize the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval or other marketing authorization would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change their policies, issue additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval of our future products under development on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain approvals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain any marketing authorizations we may have obtained.\nBased on feedback from the FDA, we intend to seek regulatory approval of bentracimab in the United States through an accelerated approval process. If we are not successful with this process, the development and commercialization of bentracimab could be delayed, abandoned or significantly more costly.\nThe FDA\u2019s accelerated approval regulations allow drugs that are being developed to treat an unmet medical need to be approved substantially based on evidence of an effect on a surrogate biomarker endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. Based on feedback from the FDA, our strategy is to use an accelerated approval pathway that may require that our REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab be ongoing at the time of BLA approval. To support our BLA submission for accelerated approval, the FDA recommended an interim analysis of biomarker data from an initial subset of 100 patients, with approximately 50 patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding and approximately 50 patients requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure, in our REVERSE-IT trial, together with safety data from our Phase 2 clinical trials. After we submit our BLA with data from the first 100 patients, we intend to complete the REVERSE-IT trial and establish a post-approval registry in accordance with FDA requirements. If the FDA requires the completion of the REVERSE-IT trial prior to the submission of a BLA, the development and commercialization timeline of bentracimab will be delayed. We may also experience an imbalance in the number and types of patients who enroll in the REVERSE-IT trial. We have enrolled more than half of the first approximately 100 patients needed to support our BLA submission, nearly all of whom to date have required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. We are attempting to accelerate enrollment of patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, including by working to increase the number of enrolling clinical trial sites in the United States, Canada, and the European Union as we believe that a broader site footprint will increase the probability of enrolling these patients. All of the first approximately 100 patients enrolled in the REVERSE-IT trial will be measured against the same VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker. If we are unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in this trial, including patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, the FDA may determine that the trials conducted by us were insufficient to support approval for all or\nsome of the proposed indications we intend to pursue. Further, the FDA may require us to conduct extensive post-approval studies or require us to make modifications to our ongoing REVERSE-IT trial after approval and marketing.\nClinical product development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs and experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval to market a new biological or drug product we must demonstrate proof of safety, purity and efficacy in humans. The risk of failure for product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing or at any time during the trial process. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe have not completed all clinical trials required for the approval of any of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that any clinical trial that we are conducting, or may conduct in the future, will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe may incur additional costs and experience delays in ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates, and we do not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites or prospective CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u2022the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates or if any such trial is terminated, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our\ncosts, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u2022be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nSuccess in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials may not be indicative of results in future clinical trials.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Preclinical tests and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are primarily designed to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand the side effects of product candidates at various doses and schedules. Success in preclinical or animal studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large-scale efficacy trials will be successful nor does it predict final results. Our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of our product candidate development. Any such delays could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInterim \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim top-line or preliminary results from our clinical trials. Interim results from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, or serious adverse or unacceptable side effects may be identified during the development of our product candidates, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization, increase our costs or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe, pure and effective for use in each target indication, and failures can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical trials often fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy of the product candidate studied for the target indication. Based on the health profile of our patient population, it is possible that we may experience a serious adverse event that could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization, increase our costs or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses in which the side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The FDA or an institutional review board may also require that we suspend, discontinue, or limit our clinical trials based on safety information, or that we conduct additional animal or human studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our product candidates which we have not planned or anticipated. Such findings could further result in regulatory authorities failing to provide marketing authorization for our product candidates or limiting the scope of the approved indication, if approved. Many product candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the product candidate.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the labels;\n\u2022we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022we may not be able to achieve or maintain third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement; and\n\u2022our reputation and physician or patient acceptance of our products may suffer.\nThere can be no assurance that we will resolve any issues related to any product-related adverse events to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory agency in a timely manner or at all. Moreover, any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nAs an organization, we have never completed pivotal clinical trials, and we may be unable to do so for any product candidates we may develop.\nWe will need to successfully complete pivotal clinical trials in order to obtain the approval of the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies to market bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidate. Carrying out pivotal clinical trials is a complicated process. As an organization, we have not previously completed any later stage or pivotal clinical trials. In order to do so, we have needed to and will need to further expand our clinical development and regulatory capabilities, and we may be unable to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. We also expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our pivotal clinical trials. See \u201c- Risks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties -We rely on third parties to conduct a significant portion of our existing clinical trials and potential future clinical trials for product candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\u201d In particular, pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operational support in the European Union. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to BLA or NDA submission and approval of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or future product candidates. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of product candidates that we develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials, could prevent us from or delay us in commercializing our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nSuccessful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of patients. Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. We cannot predict how successful we will be at enrolling subjects in future clinical trials. Subject enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022the eligibility criteria for the trial in question;\n\u2022the size of the patient population and process for identifying patients;\n\u2022the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate in the trial;\n\u2022the availability of competing commercially available therapies and other competing drug candidates\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to be enrolled in our clinical trials;\n\u2022the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022potential disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including difficulties in initiating clinical sites, enrolling and retaining participants, diversion of healthcare resources away from clinical trials, travel or quarantine policies that may be implemented, and other factors;\n\u2022the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, we rely on and expect to continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we will have limited influence over their performance.\nFurthermore, even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials, we may have difficulty maintaining enrollment of such patients in our clinical trials.\nChanges in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates proceed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards potential approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and product characteristics. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the materials manufactured using altered processes. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenue.\nOur clinical development of bentracimab depends on the continued use of ticagrelor as an antiplatelet therapy.\nWe are developing bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent for the treatment of patients on ticagrelor with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. If previously unknown safety risks related to ticagrelor are discovered that would affect its use as an antiplatelet therapy, or if market acceptance of ticagrelor significantly changes, we may pause or stop development of bentracimab, which would significantly and adversely affect our business prospects.\nELP is a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time, risks and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval of our ELP product candidates.\nPemziviptadil and certain other preclinical product candidates are based on our proprietary ELP technology. Some of our future success depends on the successful development of this technology and products based on it. To our knowledge, no regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market and commercialize therapeutics using our novel ELP technology. We may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate that utilizes ELP.\nIf we uncover any previously unknown risks related to our ELP technology, or if we experience unanticipated problems or delays in developing our ELP product candidates, we may be unable to complete our clinical trials and preclinical\nstudies, meet the obligations of our license agreements or commercialize our product candidates on a timely or profitable basis. If serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are observed in clinical trials or preclinical studies of a product candidate based on our ELP technology, our ability to develop other product candidates based on our ELP technology would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain orphan drug designations or exclusivity for pemziviptadil or other product candidates, which could limit the potential profitability of such product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, designate drugs intended for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Generally, a product that has orphan drug designation and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.\nThe FDA has granted two orphan drug designations for pemziviptadil: one for the treatment of PAH and a second for cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. We may seek orphan drug designation for future indications for pemziviptadil or for other product candidates. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not obtain orphan exclusivity and that exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug from the competition of different drugs for the same condition, which could be approved during the exclusivity period. Additionally, after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA could subsequently approve another application for the same drug for the same indication if the FDA concludes that the later drug is shown to be safer or more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States also may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. The failure to obtain an orphan drug designation for any product candidates we may develop, the inability to maintain that designation for the duration of the applicable period, or the inability to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity could reduce our ability to make sufficient sales of the applicable product candidate to balance our expenses incurred to develop it, which would have a negative impact on our operational results and financial condition.\nBreakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA and PRIME designation by the EMA for bentracimab, or any other product candidate, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will receive marketing approval.\nWe have received a Breakthrough Therapy designation for bentracimab for the reversal of ticagrelor's antiplatelet activity and may, in the future, apply for Breakthrough Therapy designation for other product candidates. A Breakthrough Therapy is defined as a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For product candidates that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the BLA.\nDesignation as a Breakthrough Therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nAccess to the PRIME initiative is granted by the EMA to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. The receipt of this access for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional EMA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by the EMA. In addition, even though bentracimab has been granted access to PRIME, the EMA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions for such access.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to increase our pipeline of product candidates, including by pursuing additional indications for our current product candidates or in-licensing or acquiring additional product candidates for other diseases.\nA key element of our strategy is to build and expand our pipeline of product candidates, including by developing pemziviptadil for the treatment of other orphan conditions, and PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension and by identifying other product candidates using our ELP technology. In addition, we may in-license or acquire additional product candidates for other diseases. We may not be able to identify or develop product candidates that are safe, tolerable and effective. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify, in-license or acquire may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of their being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on development programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent, pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH and PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications for pemziviptadil that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates in the United Kingdom, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our product candidates into the United Kingdom, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates in the United Kingdom.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed to by the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. A trade and cooperation agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, that outlines the future and trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union was agreed to in December 2020.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and will continue to have, a material impact on the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. For example, Great Britain is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorizations from the EMA, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market our product candidates in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would delay or prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and limit our ability to generate revenue in that territory. While the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the United Kingdom and the European Union, there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade that did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the United Kingdom diverge from the European Union from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. We could therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to prior to the end of the Transition Period) to operate our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate\nrevenues or achieve profitability of our business. Any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United Kingdom.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nMarket acceptance of bentracimab, if approved, will depend heavily on the continued market acceptance and use of ticagrelor.\nThe commercial success of bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent, if approved, is dependent on the continued market acceptance and use of ticagrelor as an antiplatelet therapy. Ticagrelor competes against other commercially available antiplatelet therapies, including other P2Y12 receptor antagonists, many of which are available as generic drugs and therefore significantly less expensive than ticagrelor. New antiplatelet therapies may also be developed in the future, including other P2Y12 receptor antagonists and other antiplatelet therapies, which could also have reversal agents, that could displace ticagrelor as the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology\u2019s preferred antiplatelet agent for acute coronary syndrome or otherwise reduce ticagrelor\u2019s market position. Any such changes in the market acceptance and use of ticagrelor would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects for bentracimab.\nEven if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the efficacy, safety and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling, including any black box warning;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new treatments and of physicians to prescribe these treatments;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain a sales force in the United States;\n\u2022the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and any other product candidates, once approved;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u2022any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate that may receive regulatory approval, we may not be successful in commercializing those product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have sales or marketing infrastructure. To achieve commercial success for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization. In the future, we expect to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market some of our product candidates in the United States, if and when they are approved. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or\nunnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to market our products on our own include:\n\u2022our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians in order to educate physicians about our product candidates, once approved;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and are forced to enter into arrangements with, and rely on, third parties to perform these services, our revenue and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we had developed such capabilities ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in a smaller than expected commercial opportunity and/or others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies, compounding facilities, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.\nThere are currently no other known reversal agents approved or in clinical development for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs. In the European Union, an extracorporeal whole blood purification adsorber device is available that may be useful for non-specific removal of ticagrelor during some cardiac procedures when used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass. Upon approval, bentracimab would be the only therapeutic agent available for specific reversal of ticagrelor. There can be no assurance that competitors will not seek to develop a competing product. Moreover, the success of bentracimab, if approved, will be dependent on the continued success of ticagrelor. See \u201c-Market acceptance of bentracimab, if approved, will depend heavily on the continued market acceptance and use of ticagrelor.\u201d\nWe are aware of several other products and product candidates as potential treatments for PAH that would compete with pemziviptadil. Although we anticipate that pemziviptadil may be used as a complement to patients\u2019 existing therapies, we expect to compete with existing treatments for PAH patients with Class II-IV symptoms that target the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways, as well as any generic equivalents that may be developed. In addition to currently approved drugs within these classes, we are also aware of a number of PAH therapies in clinical development with which pemziviptadil would compete if approved.\nIn addition, we are aware of several other products and product candidates as potential treatments for treatment-resistant hypertension that could compete with PB6440. Although we anticipate that PB6440 may be used as a complement to patients\u2019 existing antihypertensive therapies, we expect to compete with existing generic treatments for hypertension that target the mineralocorticoid receptor. In addition to the currently approved mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, eplerenone and spironolactone, we are also aware of a number of therapies in clinical development for the treatment of resistant hypertension with which PB6440 would compete if approved, including CIN-107, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor currently being evaluated by CinCor Pharma, Inc. in a Phase 2 clinical trial.\nIn addition, our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nThe success of bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent, pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH, PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension or any future product candidate will depend significantly on coverage and adequate reimbursement or the willingness of patients to pay for these procedures.\nWe believe our success depends on obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent, pemziviptadil for the treatment of PAH, PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension and/or procedures utilizing bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate, and the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out-of-pocket for such products and procedures, in the absence of reimbursement for all or part of the cost. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, managed care organizations, and private health insurers, may package the cost of the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our product. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Additionally, in the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement.\nThird-party payors determine which products and procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular product or procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure, including costs associated with products used during the procedure, and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement. Physicians may be unlikely to offer procedures for such treatment if they are not covered by insurance and may be unlikely to purchase and use our product candidates, if approved, for our stated indications unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that a procedure is safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.\nFurther, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. An example of payment rate updates occurs in the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula and introduced a merit-based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. This program provides clinicians with two ways to participate, including through the Advanced Alternative Payment Models and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System. In November 2019, CMS issued a rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. The full impact to overall physician reimbursement as a result of the introduction of the Quality Payment Program remains unclear. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Any resulting decrease in payment under the merit-based reimbursement system may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, the Medicare physician fee schedule has been adapted by some private payors into their plan-specific physician payment schedule. We cannot predict how pending and future healthcare legislation will impact our business, and any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our product candidates or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our products could harm our business.\nForeign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and we cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to the treatments in which our products are used under any foreign reimbursement system.\nThere can be no assurance that bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate, if approved for sale in the United States or in other countries, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that reimbursement policies and practices in the United States and in foreign countries where our products are sold will not adversely affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if they are approved for sale.\nThe market for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates may be smaller than we expect.\nOur estimates of the potential market opportunity for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications and third-party research reports. These assumptions include, for bentracimab, the number of patients on ticagrelor who will experience uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or who will require urgent surgery or an invasive procedure; for pemziviptadil, the number of patients with PAH; and for PB6440, the number of patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, as well as the estimated reimbursement levels for each product candidate if approved. However, there can be no assurance that any of these assumptions are, or will remain, accurate. If the actual market for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or for any other product candidates we may develop is smaller than we expect, our revenues, if any, may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or drugs caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidates or drugs that we may develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards paid to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10,000,000 in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10,000,000, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct a significant portion of our existing clinical trials and potential future clinical trials for product candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nTo date, we have generally engaged CROs to conduct or assist in our ongoing clinical trials of bentracimab and pemziviptadil. We expect to engage CROs for future clinical trials for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or other product candidates that we may progress to clinical development. In addition, pursuant to the SFJ Agreement, SFJ will have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and will provide clinical trials operational support in the European Union. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, including clinical data\nmanagement organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct these clinical trials. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us, some in the event of an uncured material breach and some at any time for convenience. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to timely enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Switching or adding CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, the performance of our CROs may also be interrupted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including due to travel or quarantine policies, heightened exposure of CRO staff who are healthcare providers to COVID-19 or prioritization of resources toward the pandemic.\nIn addition, any third parties conducting our clinical trials will not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed significantly.\nWe rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and generally do not control their activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. If we or any of our CROs or other third parties, including trial sites, fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP conditions. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidates.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab and pemziviptadil for clinical drug supply and expect to continue to do so for commercialization if approved. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any cGMP manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the cGMP manufacture of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and any other product candidates that we may pursue, for clinical development as well as for commercial manufacture of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and any other product candidates which we may pursue, if we receive marketing approval. We also rely on a proprietary E. coli strain owned by Wacker Biotech GmbH, or Wacker, which we have licensed for the production of bentracimab. Our reliance on Wacker\u2019s E.\ncoli strain increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of bentracimab or be able to obtain quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our clinical trials or our other development or commercialization efforts.\nWith respect to bentracimab, to date we have only relied upon Wacker for manufacture of drug substance for use in our initial clinical trials. As we scale our manufacturing of bentracimab to meet potential commercial demand, if bentracimab is approved, we have initiated a technology transfer of our current manufacturing process for bentracimab to BioVectra Inc., or BioVectra, another cGMP contract manufacturer. We have engaged BioVectra to manufacture drug substance for our ongoing clinical trials and recently engaged BioVectra to manufacture commercial supply of bentracimab, if approved. We will need to perform analytical and other tests to demonstrate that the new materials produced by Wacker, BioVectra, or any other future third-party manufacturer that we engage, are comparable in all respects to the product utilized in our previous clinical trials. There is no assurance that any such product will pass the required comparability testing in a timely manner, or at all, that any other future third-party manufacturer that we engage will be successful in producing bentracimab or that any materials produced by Wacker, BioVectra or any other third-party manufacturer that we engage will have the same effect in patients that we have observed to date with respect to materials used in our previous clinical trials. Moreover, if supplies are interrupted or produced in poor yield or quality, it would materially harm our business. BioVectra will be required to scale up the manufacturing process to meet our future needs of bentracimab for later-stage clinical development and, if approved, commercialization. If BioVectra is unable to successfully scale up the manufacturing process, we would need to find alternative manufacturing facilities or an alternative manufacturing process, which we may not be able to do on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and which could adversely affect the clinical development of bentracimab.\nWe also expect to rely on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be inspected by the FDA or other regulatory authorities after we submit our BLA or comparable marketing application to the FDA or other regulatory authority. We do not have control over a supplier\u2019s or manufacturer\u2019s compliance with laws, regulations and applicable cGMP standards or similar regulatory requirements and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of our marketing applications. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority finds deficiencies with or does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe may be unable to enter into any agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we enter into such agreements, qualifying and validating such manufacturers may take a significant period of time and reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022the incurrence of upfront scale-up costs prior to commercial approval;\n\u2022the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022the possible increase in costs for the raw materials for our product candidates; and\n\u2022the possible termination or nonrenewal of any agreement by any third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nOur failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supply of our products.\nOur product candidates, and any drugs that we may develop, may compete with other product candidates and drugs for access to manufacturing facilities. The performance of our third-party manufacturers may also be interrupted by production shortages or other supply interruptions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There are no assurances we would be able to enter into similar commercial arrangements with other manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations\nand that might be capable of manufacturing for us in a timely manner. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval.\nWe are collaborating with SFJ for the development of bentracimab, and we may seek additional collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe are collaborating with SFJ for the development of bentracimab. We may seek additional third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including for the commercialization of any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing outside the United States. Our likely collaborators for any such arrangements include regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we enter into any additional such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates would pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or drugs, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such products;\n\u2022disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If SFJ or any future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nWe may seek to establish additional collaborations, and if we are unable to do so, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional capital. We are collaborating with SFJ for the development of bentracimab. For our other product candidates, we may decide to establish additional collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to any of our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates and our ELP technology. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and product candidates.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our patent estate contained at least 22 patent families that we own or in-license that protect various aspects of our product candidates or our ELP technology platform. We own or have rights in 24 United States patents, 15 United States patent applications, 107 foreign patents and 64 foreign patent applications. We cannot offer any assurances about which of our patent applications will issue, the breadth of any resulting patent or whether any of the issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. We cannot offer any assurances that the breadth of our granted patents will be sufficient to stop a competitor from developing and commercializing a product, including a biosimilar product that would be competitive with one or more of our product candidates. Furthermore, any successful challenge to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a commercially reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Moreover, depending on the terms of\nany future in-licenses to which we may become a party, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology in-licensed from third parties. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nIn addition to the protection provided by our patent estate, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not amenable to patent protection. Although we generally require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop knowledge, methods and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products, if approved, and replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, our agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Also, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA is considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA\u2019s disclosure policies may change in the future. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time, and if we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar non-United States legislation for extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent may be extended, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our current and future intellectual property licenses with third parties or the SFJ Agreement, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are heavily reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology for the development of bentracimab, pemziviptadil and our ELP technology. These license agreements impose diligence, development and commercialization timelines and milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate our licenses, in which event we might not be able to develop,\nmanufacture or market any product that is covered by the intellectual property we in-license from such licensor and may face other penalties. Such an occurrence would materially adversely affect our business prospects.\nLicenses to additional third-party technology and materials that may be required for our development programs may not be available in the future or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the licensed and sublicensed intellectual property relating to bentracimab, we may require the cooperation of our licensors and any upstream licensor, which may not be forthcoming. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of these patent rights will be in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If we or our licensor fail to maintain such patents, or if we or our licensor lose rights to those patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. In addition to the foregoing, the risks associated with patent rights that we license from third parties will also apply to patent rights we may own in the future. Further, if we fail to comply with our development obligations under our license agreements, we may lose our patent rights with respect to such agreement on a territory-by-territory basis, which would affect our patent rights worldwide.\nTermination of our current or any future license agreements would reduce or eliminate our rights under these agreements and may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from commercializing our other product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and overall financial condition.\nIn addition, intellectual property rights that we in-license in the future may be sublicenses under intellectual property owned by third parties, in some cases through multiple tiers. The actions of our licensors may therefore affect our rights to use our sublicensed intellectual property, even if we are in compliance with all of the obligations under our license agreements. Should our licensors or any of the upstream licensors fail to comply with their obligations under the agreements pursuant to which they obtain the rights that are sublicensed to us, or should such agreements be terminated or amended, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates may be materially harmed.\nFurther, we have granted SFJ a security interest in all of our assets related to bentracimab, pursuant to the SFJ Agreement. If we are unable to meet our payment obligations to SFJ, SFJ may exercise its remedies as a holder of a first priority security interest, which would result in a loss of our bentracimab intellectual property rights and our business would be materially harmed.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our future patents.\nOur ability to obtain patents is highly uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, and there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States. Furthermore, the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific, and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nFor example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act included a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These included provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective in March 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act has also introduced procedures making it easier for third parties to challenge issued patents, as well as to intervene in the prosecution of patent applications. Finally, the Leahy-Smith Act contained new statutory provisions that require the USPTO to issue new regulations for their implementation, and it may take the courts years to interpret the provisions of the new statute. It is too early to tell what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business and the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our future patents. Further, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once\nobtained. Depending on actions by the United States Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have owned or licensed or that we might obtain in the future. An inability to obtain, enforce, and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially and adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nSimilarly, changes in patent laws and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions, changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we may obtain in the future. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. For example, if the issuance in a given country of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the claims or the written description or enablement, in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe the patents we have applied for. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product or product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are common, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that the patent claims we are asserting are invalid and/or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the technology in question. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, inter partes review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (for example, opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel, and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or force us to take a license under the patent rights of the prevailing party, if available. Furthermore, our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may be unsuccessful in licensing or acquiring intellectual property from third parties that may be required to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development and commercialization of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to acquire or obtain a license to such intellectual property from these third parties, and we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain.\nAs our current and future product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. We cannot provide any assurance that our current and future product candidates do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents or other proprietary rights, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event. We may become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and future product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such United States patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is high and requires us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such United States patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would agree with us and invalidate the claims of any such United States patent. Moreover, given the vast number of patents in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe existing patents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future.\nWhile we may decide to initiate proceedings to challenge the validity of these or other patents in the future, we may be unsuccessful, and courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad could uphold the validity of any such patent. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates. Regardless of when filed, we may fail to identify relevant third-party patents or patent applications, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid or not infringed by our product candidates or activities. If a patent holder believes that one of our product candidates infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant drug revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. If a patent infringement suit were threatened or brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the drug or product candidate that is the subject of the actual or threatened suit.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court orders, to cease commercializing our product candidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for substantial monetary damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed the patent at issue. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nThe cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our future patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our future patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patent applications, our future patents, or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Although it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, and we cannot be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the face of a potential challenge, or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an adequate remedy. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nReliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nIf we rely on third parties to manufacture or commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates, or if we collaborate with additional third parties for the development of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical know-how or other trade secrets by the parties to these agreements. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our confidential information or proprietary technology and processes. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. If any of the collaborators, scientific advisors, employees, contractors and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets as a result. Moreover, if confidential information that is licensed or disclosed to us by our partners, collaborators, or others is inadvertently disclosed or subject to a breach or violation, we may be exposed to liability to the owner of that confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets.\nWe may enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents, and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling and prosecuting patent applications and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement rights are not as strong as that in the United States or Europe. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our future patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nIn addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before they are granted. The examination of each national or regional patent application is an independent proceeding. As a result, patent applications in the same family may issue as patents in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, but may issue as patents with claims of different scope or may even be refused in other jurisdictions. It is also quite common that depending on the country, the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology.\nWhile we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets. If we encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished, and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the United States and Europe, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our future patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our future patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing as patents, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nSome countries also have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In those countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patents. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may obtain in the future. Furthermore, the USPTO and various non-United States government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse of a patent or patent application can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny trademarks we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or otherwise violated, or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish our product candidates, if approved for marketing, from the drugs of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. Any of the foregoing events may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022others may be able to make products that are similar to or otherwise competitive with our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our current or future patents;\n\u2022an in-license necessary for the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of one or more of our product candidates may be terminated by the licensor;\n\u2022we or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our issued or future issued patents or our pending patent applications;\n\u2022we or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or in-license may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or in-license may not provide coverage for all aspects of our product candidates in all countries;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance Matters\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the law commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations promulgated under such laws. These laws will impact, among other things, our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs, and other interactions with healthcare professionals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct or may conduct our business. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or arrangement for or recommendation of the purchase, lease, order or arrangement for any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. A person does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government payors, that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or property presented to the United States federal government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies\u2019 marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as \u201ccovered entities\u201d, and their respective HIPAA \u201cbusiness associates\u201d, which are independent contractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n\u2022the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to: (1) payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u2019\u2019 made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and (2) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, which will be expanded beginning in 2022 to require applicable manufacturers to report such information regarding their\npayments or other transfers of value made during the prior year to physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives; and\n\u2022state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws and regulations; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, imposes privacy and security obligations on any entity that collects and/or processes health data from individuals located in the European Union. Under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance. In addition, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. As well as complicating our compliance efforts, non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in federal and state funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, diminished profits and future earnings, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could harm our business.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates, they will remain subject to ongoing regulatory oversight.\nEven if we obtain any regulatory approval for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates, such product candidates, once approved, will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promoting, sampling, record-keeping and submitting of safety and other post-market information, among other things. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates may also be subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or requirements that we conduct potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 trials, and in the event that we receive accelerated approval of bentracimab, the completion of a Phase 3 trial, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval. We\nwill further be required to immediately report any serious and unexpected adverse events and certain quality or production problems with our products to regulatory authorities along with other periodic reports.\nAny new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. We will also have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drug products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we will not be allowed to promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval, commonly known as off-label promotion. The holder of an approved BLA must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain prior approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements and adherence to commitments made in the BLA or NDA or foreign marketing application. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a drug, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured or if a regulatory authority disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of that drug, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that drug, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting a recall or requiring withdrawal of the drug from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022issue an untitled letter or warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022seek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022refuse to approve a pending BLA, NDA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners;\n\u2022restrict the marketing or manufacturing of the drug;\n\u2022seize or detain the drug or otherwise require the withdrawal of the drug from the market;\n\u2022refuse to permit the import or export of product candidates; or\n\u2022refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nHealthcare legislative or regulatory reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 share of sales to federal health care programs.\nThere have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d On December 14, 2018, a judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is uncertain when a decision will be made. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including amount others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that sought to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any\nreduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action may be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny new regulations or guidance, or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations or guidance, may impose additional costs or lengthen FDA review times for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future product candidates. We cannot determine how changes in regulations, statutes, policies, or interpretations when and if issued, enacted or adopted, may affect our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022additional clinical trials to be conducted prior to obtaining approval;\n\u2022changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022recalls, replacements, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u2022additional recordkeeping.\nSuch changes would likely require substantial time and impose significant costs, or could reduce the potential commercial value of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or other product candidates, and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any other products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, development, clinical, financial and business development expertise of our executive officers, particularly Jonathan P. Mow, our Chief Executive Officer. Each of our executive officers may currently terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of our product pipeline toward scaling up for commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe expect to expand our clinical development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 50 employees. As our development progresses, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of clinical product development, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to be developed or sustained.\nPrior to our initial public offering, or IPO, there was no public market for our common stock, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. As a result, it may be difficult for you to sell shares at an attractive price or at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since our IPO, our common stock has traded at prices ranging from $2.55 to $16.65 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022the commencement, enrollment or results of our clinical trials of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates;\n\u2022any delay in our regulatory filings for bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate we may develop, and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n\u2022adverse results from, delays in or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of bentracimab, pemziviptadil, PB6440 or any other product candidate;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or by any equity research analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u2022conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biopharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022progress under our collaboration with SFJ for the development of bentracimab;\n\u2022announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022general political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market in general has, and the Nasdaq Global Market and biotechnology companies in particular have, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies, including very recently in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this section, could have a significant and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are available for immediate resale. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 registering the issuance of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered under these registration statements on Form S-8 will be available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options and the restrictions of Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates.\nAdditionally, the holders of approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock, or their transferees, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plan or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, in the future we may issue common stock or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plan or otherwise. The number of new shares of our common stock issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, which could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change of control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u2022only one of our three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 66 2\u20443% vote and only for cause;\n\u2022stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u2022stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transactions.\nSome of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the current market price of our common stock and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more interested in selling our company to an acquirer than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:\n\u2022not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and\n\u2022not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nUnder Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may, under certain circumstances, still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and, if we are a smaller reporting company with less than $100 million in annual revenue, we would not be required to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. We may qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as (i) the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter .\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from our recent public offerings. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of these cash and cash equivalents may not yield any return on your investment. We expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents to advance bentracimab, pemziviptadil and PB6440, fund development of our ELP technology and preclinical programs and for working capital and general corporate purposes. In addition, we may use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to pursue our strategy to in-license or acquire additional product candidates. Our failure to apply our cash and cash equivalents effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these cash and cash equivalents. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use these cash and cash equivalents.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of the SFJ Agreement preclude us from paying dividends, and any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business activities will be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\nAs we expand our business activities outside of the United States, including our clinical trial efforts, we will be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-United States government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore requires significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-United States governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers will be subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of facilities, including those of our suppliers and manufacturers, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries as well as difficulties in manufacturing or continuing to develop our products, and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. As a newly public company, we have only limited research coverage by equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of\nresearch coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is listed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nWe may identify weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nNew or future changes to tax laws could materially adversely affect our company.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which significantly revises the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Future guidance from the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, on March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which modifies the Tax Act in certain respects. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our United States operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future United States tax expense. The foregoing items, as well as any other future changes in tax laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $185.1 million, $167.2 million, respectively. The federal NOLs generated prior to 2018 may be used to offset up to 100% of future taxable income and will begin to expire in 2022, unless previously utilized or limited by other provisions within the tax law. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses incurred in the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited. It is uncertain how various states will respond to the Tax Act and CARES Act. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to taxation in more than one tax jurisdiction. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including passage of the newly enacted federal income tax law, changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nWe have begun incurring increased costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we are incurring significant additional legal, accounting and other costs. These additional costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability and damage to our reputation, and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.", "PERMNO": 18210, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PHAS"}
