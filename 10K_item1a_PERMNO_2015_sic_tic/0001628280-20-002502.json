{"cik": "727207", "company": "Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially adversely affected, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe have limited revenues from our products and no assurance of future revenues.\nWe have received limited revenue from sales of the Accelerate Pheno system and the Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we experienced losses from operations. Our future revenues are dependent on the successful commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno system, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful at the levels necessary to cover the costs of operations. If we are unsuccessful in generating sufficient revenues from the Accelerate Pheno system or any of our other products, we will likely continue to experience losses from operations and negative cash flow.\nUntil we received FDA approval to market the Accelerate Pheno system, we were a development-stage company and therefore incurred significant losses in prior years. While we are in the early years of commercializing the Accelerate Pheno system, we may continue to incur losses. We cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant costs in connection with the development and commercialization of our technology, and there is no assurance that we will achieve sufficient revenues to offset anticipated operating costs. We have incurred significant losses in recent years and expect to incur losses in the future. Although our technology is now commercial, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will generally increase due to the additional costs associated with establishing and expanding a dedicated sales force and other marketing efforts for the Accelerate Pheno system. Our ability to achieve or sustain profitability depends on numerous factors including the market acceptance of our product, future product development and our market penetration and margins. If we are unsuccessful in generating sufficient revenues from the Accelerate Pheno system, we will likely continue to experience losses from operations and negative cash flow. Although we anticipate deriving revenues from the sale of our products, no assurance can be given that these products can be sold on a net profit basis. If we achieve profitability, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nOur future profitability and continued existence are dependent in large part upon the successful commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno system and further development and commercialization of associated test kits and complimentary products.\nOur principal business strategy involves the successful commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno system, development of associated test kits and the future development and commercialization of complimentary products. On June 30, 2015, we declared our conformity to the European In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79/ EC and applied a CE Mark to the Accelerate Pheno system and the Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit for in vitro diagnostic use. On February 23, 2017, the FDA granted our de novo request to market our Accelerate Pheno system and Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit. We have and will continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to market and sell the Accelerate Pheno system. Likewise, we plan to continue our investment in the development of additional test kits and the commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno system in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we intend to pursue marketing authorization. There can be no assurance that we will successfully commercialize the Accelerate Pheno system, any associated test kits, including the Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit, or further develop and commercialize complimentary products. We may be required to expend significantly more resources than planned in this process, and as a result we may have to cease investing in the Accelerate Pheno system or developing other products.\nIf we are not successful in the development of product improvements and additional test kits and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno system, such failure could lead to impairment of certain of our intellectual property and may result in our ceasing operations.\nOur efforts to educate hospitals on the benefits of the Accelerate Pheno system require significant resources, and we may experience reluctance from hospitals to purchase our products. If we fail to successfully commercialize the Accelerate Pheno system, we may never receive a return on the significant investments in product development, sales and marketing, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and quality assurance we have made, and on further investments we intend to make, and may fail to generate revenue and gain economies of scale from such investments.\nFurthermore, the potential market for the Accelerate Pheno system may not expand as we anticipate or may even decline based on numerous factors, including the introduction of superior alternative products or the development of new technologies. If we are unable to adequately expand the market for the Accelerate Pheno system, this failure would have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute on our business plan and ability to generate revenue.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling the Accelerate Pheno system.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling the Accelerate Pheno system. We have established a sales force in the United States and some areas of Europe to market the Accelerate Pheno system directly to our target customers. We plan to continue to build and refine our sales force in the United States. In select geographies outside of the United States, we also use third-party distributors to market our product.\nOur future sales will depend in large part on our ability to successfully establish an effective sales force and distributor network. Because we have limited experience in marketing and selling the Accelerate Pheno system, our ability to forecast demand, the infrastructure required to support such demand and the sales cycle of our potential customers is unproven.\nMoreover, we do use third-party distribution partners for certain geographic areas outside of the United States, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell the Accelerate Pheno system effectively or may choose to favor marketing the products of our competitors. If distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to enter into effective arrangements with distributors in particular geographic areas, we may not realize our full potential for sales and growth in these areas.\nOur future product candidates have not obtained marketing authorization from the FDA, and they may never obtain such marketing authorization or other regulatory clearance.\nOur success in part depends on our ability to obtain additional product marketing authorizations from the FDA for product candidates in our pipeline. If our attempts to obtain marketing authorization or other regulatory clearance are unsuccessful, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business. Our future product candidates may not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to obtain, or may prove to have other characteristics that preclude our obtaining, marketing authorization from the FDA or regulatory clearance. The process of obtaining\nregulatory clearance is expensive and time-consuming and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of our product candidates. Changes in regulatory policy, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the clearance of, or receipt of marketing authorization from the FDA for, a product candidate or rejection of a regulatory application altogether. The FDA has substantial discretion in the de novo review and clearance processes and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for clearance and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing authorization from the FDA or regulatory clearance of a product candidate. Any marketing authorization from the FDA or regulatory clearance we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the product candidate not commercially viable.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals. These goals may include the commencement or completion of clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these goals. All of these goals are, and will be, based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these goals can vary significantly compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. We may experience numerous unforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including the uncertainties and risks set forth in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. If we do not meet our goals as publicly announced, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may not be able to enhance the capabilities of our current and new products to keep pace with our industry\u2019s rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend significantly on our ability to enhance our current products and develop or acquire and market new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards as well as respond to changes in customer needs. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better combinations of price and performance than the products and systems that we plan to sell. It is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and physician, hospital and healthcare provider practices and successfully introduce new, enhanced and competitive technologies to meet our prospective customers\u2019 needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. At the same time, however, we must carefully manage our introduction of new products. If potential customers believe that such new products will offer enhanced features or be sold for a more attractive price, they may delay purchases of existing products until such new products are available.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing or acquiring product enhancements or new products to address changing technologies and customer requirements adequately, that we can introduce such products on a timely basis or that any such products or enhancements will be successful in the marketplace. If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new products or if the market does not accept our products, or if we experience difficulties or delays in the final development and commercialization of our products, we may be unable to attract additional customers for our products or strategic partners to license our products.\nWe are developing additional uses for the Accelerate Pheno system. Any failure or delay in launching new applications may compromise our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nWe are developing additional uses for the Accelerate Pheno system, including the ability to test on additional specimen types (e.g., respiratory, urine, and intra-abdominal samples). We may have problems applying our technologies to additional specimen types, and our new applications may not be as effective in detection as our initial applications. We may also encounter difficulties obtaining regulatory approval for additional uses of the Accelerate Pheno system. Any failure or delay in launching new applications may compromise our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nThe failure of the Accelerate Pheno system or any future diagnostic products to perform as expected could significantly impair our reputation and the public image of our products, and we may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nOur success will depend on the market\u2019s confidence that our technologies can provide reliable, high-quality diagnostic results. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to any defects or errors in the Accelerate Pheno system. If we experience disruptions or other performance problems with the Accelerate Pheno system or any future diagnostic product, we could face warranty and liability claims against us and our reputation could suffer as a result of such failures. We cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would adequately protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. In addition, the FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. A recall, material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products could cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our key personnel or cause other significant customer relations problems.\nIn the past, we have experienced disappointing or negative publication results regarding the efficacy of our products. Such negative publicity could diminish our reputation and future sales of our products, which could have a material impact on our financial performance.\nIf treatment guidelines for bacterial infections change, or the standard of care evolves, we may need to redesign and seek new marketing authorization from the FDA for our product candidates.\nIf treatment guidelines for bacterial infections change, or the standard of care evolves, we may need to redesign and seek new marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory clearance for our product candidates. If treatment guidelines change so that different treatments become desirable, the Accelerate Pheno system may no longer provide the information sought by physicians, and we could be required to seek marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory clearance for a revised product.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which may be outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur for research and development required to maintain and improve our technology, including the continuing development of the Accelerate Pheno system;\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur in connection with the development, marketing authorization and regulatory clearance of the use of the Accelerate Pheno system to test on additional specimen types;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur in connection with commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution expenses;\n\u2022\nthe costs incurred to build manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe expenses to implement our sales strategy;\n\u2022\nthe costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company.\nOur budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of the Accelerate Pheno system, as well as our assessment of the future investments needed to expand our commercial organization and support research and development activities in connection with the Accelerate Pheno system. We\nmay be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected events or a shortfall in revenue. Accordingly, a shortfall in demand for our products or other unexpected events could have an immediate and material impact on our cash levels.\nBreaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations and potentially result in liability, depending on the type of breach and information compromised.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, which may include protected health information, in our day-to-day operations. In addition, our research and development operations are highly dependent on our information technology and storage. Our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes and phishing attacks, and we expect to be subject to similar viruses and codes in the future. These attacks could result in our intellectual property, unsecured protected health information, and other confidential information being lost or stolen, including the disclosure of our trade secrets, disruption of our operations, loss of valuable research and development data, the need to notify individuals whose information was disclosed, increased costs for security measures or remediation costs and diversion of management attention and other negative consequences. While we will continue to implement protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. There can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business.\nFailure to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy laws to which we are subject could harm the Company.\nAny failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. A significant data privacy regulation is the General Data Protection Regulation which applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union, and has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application.\nWe are dependent on our key employees. If we are unable to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel, we may not achieve our goals.\nBecause of the complex and technical nature of our products and the dynamic market in which we compete, our future success depends on our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel, including our senior management, research and development, science and engineering, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the management and business expertise of Jack Phillips, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We do not maintain key person life insurance for Mr. Phillips or any of our employees. Our industry is very competitive for qualified personnel. To the extent that the services of Mr. Phillips would be unavailable to us, we may be unable to employ another qualified person with the appropriate background and expertise to replace Mr. Phillips on terms suitable to us. Our growth depends, in particular, on attracting, retaining and motivating highly trained sales personnel with the necessary scientific background and ability to understand our systems and pathogens at a technical level. In addition, we may need additional employees at our manufacturing facilities to meet demand for our products as we scale up our sales and marketing operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing with our competitors. We currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including those with new products, technologies or techniques.\nThe industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological changes, and we face and expect to continue to face strong competition for our products. Many of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater research and development, financial, manufacturing, customer support, sales and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may, individually or together with companies affiliated with them, have greater human and scientific resources than we do.\nOur competitors could develop new products or technologies that are more effective than the Accelerate Pheno system and any of our other products or product candidates. Additionally, we expect to face further competitive pressure resulting from the emergence of new ID or AST techniques or tests. For example, we are aware that some hospitals have begun using manual methods created through laboratory developed tests, which have been validated for internal hospital-specific use to deliver ID and AST results. Any of these newly developed products, technologies, and techniques may offer a better combination of price and performance than our products and systems. Our failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe generate a portion of our future revenue internationally and are subject to various risks relating to our international activities which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe market and sell the Accelerate Pheno system in other countries outside of the United States. In order to market our products in certain foreign jurisdictions, we, or our distributors or partners, must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all, which could harm our ability to expand into markets outside the United States. In addition, engaging in international business involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with existing and changing foreign healthcare and other regulatory requirements and laws, such as those relating to patient privacy or handling of bio-hazardous waste;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions;\n\u2022\nvarious reimbursement and insurance regimes;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls;\n\u2022\nfluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u2022\nimpediments with protecting or procuring intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, changes in policies and/or laws of the United States or foreign governments resulting in, among other changes, higher taxation, tariffs or similar protectionist laws, currency conversion limitations, limitations on business operations, or the nationalization of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners, vendors and other agents may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with legal standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners, vendors and other agents. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent failures to: (i) comply with the laws and regulations of the FDA, CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; (ii) provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies; (iii) comply with manufacturing requirements of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies and manufacturing standards we have established; (iv) comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or (v) report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. These laws may impact, among other things, our activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as our sales, marketing and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, unauthorized use of protected health information and data breaches, and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of activities related to pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, patient support, royalty, consulting, research and other business arrangements, as well as the improper use of patient information obtained in the course of clinical studies. We currently have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees and foreign distributors, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee and/or commercial partner misconduct, and our code of conduct and the other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, corporate integrity agreements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations. Any of these actions or investigations could result in substantial costs to us, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management from operating our business.\nWe may be unable to successfully manage our growth.\nWe expect to continually expand our operations to support the commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno system and future products. We intend to continue to develop a targeted sales force in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States and in other countries. Our growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management, operating and financial systems and our sales, marketing and administrative resources. As a result of our growth, operating costs may escalate faster than planned, and some of our internal systems and processes, including those relating to manufacturing our products, may need to be enhanced, updated or replaced.\nWe also plan to introduce additional test kits for use on the Accelerate Pheno system to enable its use with other sample types (e.g., blood, respiratory, urine, and intra-abdominal samples), and plan to invest in the development of additional instruments, tests and other microbiology solutions. If we cannot effectively manage our expanding operations, manufacturing capacity and costs, including scaling to meet increased demand, we may not be able to continue to grow or we may grow at a slower pace than expected.\nWe may in the future be subject to shareholder lawsuits, including purported class actions, which is expensive and could divert the attention of management away from our business. In addition, any adverse result of such litigation could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the past, companies such as Accelerate that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation and other shareholder lawsuits. We may in the future be the target of this type of litigation. Shareholder lawsuits against us, our officers or directors could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management away from operating our business and other concerns, which could harm our business.\nCurrent macroeconomic conditions and the uncertain economic outlook may remain challenging for the foreseeable future.\nGlobal economic conditions may remain challenging and uncertain for the foreseeable future. These conditions not only limit our access to capital but also make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause U.S. and foreign hospitals and other customers to slow spending on our products, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Some of our customers rely on government research grants to fund technology purchases. If negative trends in the economy affect the government\u2019s allocation of funds to research, there may be less grant funding available for certain of our customers to purchase technologies from us. Certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit or may otherwise be faced with budget constraints, which could result in decreased purchases of our products or in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If our customers do not make timely payments to us, we may be required to assume greater credit risk relating to those customers and increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted. Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, we may not continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past. Additionally, challenging macroeconomic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers, causing them to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components, thereby impairing our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs.\nCompliance with public company corporate governance and reporting is complex and expensive.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas. Many laws and regulations, notably those adopted in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and The NASDAQ Stock Market, impose obligations on public companies, such as ours, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous, requires substantial management time and oversight and requires us to incur significant additional accounting, legal and compliance costs. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services more expensive, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. In addition, our larger competitors may be in a better position to absorb the costs of being a public company. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nAdditionally, changes to existing accounting rules and standards and the implementation of new accounting rules or standards, such as tax accounting or revenue recognition rules, may adversely impact our reported financial results and business, and may further require us to incur greater accounting fees.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this Form10-K relating to the size and expected growth of our market, total available market, estimated test and placement volume and estimated pricing, may prove to be inaccurate, which may have negative consequences, such as overestimatation of our potential market opportunity. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nChanges in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends related to tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective income tax rates or operating margins and we may be required to pay additional tax assessments.\nWe conduct business globally and file tax returns in various U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in pre-tax income in various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nincreases in corporate tax rates and the availability of deductions or credits in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to U.S. federal and state regulations or interpretations resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017;\n\u2022\ntax effects related to purchase accounting for acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nresolutions of issues arising from tax examinations and any related interest or penalties.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and complex calculations in situations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liabilities is always subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with long-lived assets that may become impaired and result in an impairment charge.\nThe carrying amounts of long-lived assets are affected whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable. Property and equipment includes Accelerate Pheno systems (also referred to as instruments) used for sales demonstrations, instruments under rental agreements and instruments used for research and development.\nAdverse events or changes in circumstances may affect the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be derived from long-lived assets. If at any time we determine that an impairment has occurred, we will be required to reflect the impaired value as a charge, resulting in a reduction in earnings, such impairment is identified and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value. In the future we may incur, impairment charges. A material reduction in earnings resulting from such a charge could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property, our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights related to our proprietary technologies, both in the United States and in other countries. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. We own 18 issued U.S. patents and seven pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings. We also own 39 non-US patents and have five pending applications. We own 33 registered marks in the United States and foreign countries. In addition to our patents and trademarks, we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how, and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The strength of patents in our field involves complex legal and scientific questions. In addition, patent law continuously evolves and might change the legal framework under which our patent claims would be interpreted and adjudicated in the future. Uncertainty created by these questions and potential legal changes means that our patents may provide only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, competitors could purchase our products and attempt by reverse engineering to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of the protections provided by our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property, including licensed intellectual property, does not adequately protect our market position against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nFurther, if we are unable to prevent unauthorized disclosure of our non-patented intellectual property, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights\nto the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nWe may not be successful in our currently pending or future patent applications, and even if such applications are successful, we cannot guarantee that the resulting patents will sufficiently protect our products and proprietary technology.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents with claims that adequately cover our products and technologies in the United States or in other foreign countries, and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be issued. Further, issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship or scope, and there is no guarantee that our issued patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our technologies or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Further, we cannot be certain that all relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been identified. Accordingly, there may be prior art that can invalidate our issued patents or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, or will preclude our ability to obtain patent claims that have a scope broad enough to provide meaningful protection from our competitors.\nEven if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our products and technologies, we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents in the United States and in foreign countries, including by proceedings such as reexamination, inter-partes review, interference, opposition, or other patent office or court proceedings. The strength of patents in our field involves complex legal and scientific questions. Moreover, we cannot assure you that if such patents were challenged in court or before a regulatory agency that the patent claims will be held valid, enforceable, to be sufficiently broad to cover our technologies or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Nor can we assure you that the court or agency will uphold our ownership rights in such patents. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or narrowing of claim scope, such that we could be deprived of patent protection necessary for the successful commercialization of our products and technologies, which could adversely affect our business. To this end, we note that one of our issued European Patents, EP No. 1831692, is the subject of an Opposition proceeding within the European Patent Office. The Opposition, filed by our competitor bioMerieux, alleges that, inter alia, this issued patent claims subject matter that lacks novelty and inventive step in view of the state of the art at the time of filing. We disagree with bioMerieux\u2019s contentions, and have vigorously defended our patent as properly issued by the European Patent Office. Should we fail in our defense against bioMerieux\u2019s allegations, the opposed patent potentially could be revoked, the claims may be amended such that they no longer cover aspects of our commercialized products, or any such amended claims potentially could be designed around by competitors.\nFurthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our inventions, provide exclusivity for our products and technologies or prevent others from designing around our claims. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies. These products and technologies may not be covered by claims of issued patents for which we are the right holder. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nFurther, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. An interference is now less likely to arise due to changes in U.S. patent law that took effect in 2013, but remains a risk nonetheless. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nThird parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, including our existing patents and patent claims that may be allowed in the future. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. Further, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nIf we file an infringement action against a third party, that party may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Such litigation and administrative proceedings could result in revocation of our patents or amendment of our patent claims such that they no longer cover our product candidates. They may also put our pending patent applications at risk of not issuing or issuing with limited and potentially inadequate scope to cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nEnforcing our intellectual property rights through litigation is very expensive and time-consuming. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and reduce employee productivity. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with U.S. intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could face claims that our proprietary technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nDue to the significant number of U.S. and foreign patents issued to, and other intellectual property rights owned by, entities operating in the industry in which we operate, we believe that there is a risk of litigation arising from allegations of infringement of these patents and other rights. Third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us or our licensees.\nIn addition, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the earliest filing date for which a benefit is claimed. For this reason, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, despite our best efforts we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Another party may have filed or may in the future file patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours. Under the \u201cfirst to invent\u201d rules applicable to patents filed before March 2013, any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nWe may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe on a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. In addition, even if such claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of some of our products. Furthermore, claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties, and we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not\nuse the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property in the performance of their work to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing an enforceable agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Relevant assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to our Research and Development Activities\nWe have a single research and development facility and we may be unable to continue to conduct our research and development activities if we lose this facility. If our facility or our equipment were damaged or destroyed, or if we experience a significant disruption in our operations for any reason, our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently conduct all of our research and development and product development activities in our existing facility in Tucson, Arizona. If this facility were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to fire, floods, storms, tornadoes, other natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages or otherwise, or if our business is disrupted for any other reason, we may not be able to continue the development of future products or test our products as promptly as our potential customers expect, or possibly not at all, and we would have no other means of conducting such activities until we were able to restore such capabilities at the current facility or develop an alternative facility. Further, in such an event, we may lose revenue and significant time during which we might otherwise have conducted research and development and product development activities and, we may not be able to maintain our relationships with our licensees or customers.\nThe manufacture of components of the Accelerate Pheno system involves complex processes, sophisticated equipment and strict adherence to specifications and quality systems procedures. Any unforeseen manufacturing problems, such as contamination of our facility, equipment malfunction or failure to strictly follow procedures or meet specifications, could result in delays or shortfalls in production of our products. Identifying and resolving the cause of any manufacturing issues could require substantial time and resources. If we are unable to keep up with future demand for our products by successfully manufacturing and shipping our products in a timely manner, our revenue growth could be impaired and market acceptance of our product candidates could be adversely affected.\nWhile we carry a nominal amount of business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. If we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect to an interruption, or if an interruption is not subject to coverage under our insurance policies, we may not be able to cover our losses. In addition, our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our licensees or customers.\nWe use hazardous materials in some of our research, development and manufacturing processes and face the accompanying risks and regulations governing environmental safety.\nOur operations are subject to complex and stringent environmental, health, safety and other governmental laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce. In particular, our research activities sometimes involve the controlled use of various hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials are in material compliance with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated, and we may not be in compliance with these regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may also be revised or reinterpreted, or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us, whether retroactively or prospectively, causing us to incur additional compliance costs and/or change the manner in which we operate. We could be held liable for any damages that might result from any accident or release involving hazardous materials.\nDisruptions in the supply of raw materials, consumable goods or other key product components, or issues associated with their quality from our single source suppliers, could result in a significant disruption in sales and profitability.\nWe must manufacture or engage third parties to manufacture components of our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. Our components are custom-made by only a few outside suppliers. In certain instances, we have a sole source supply for key product components of the Accelerate Pheno system. We may be unable to satisfy our forecast demand from existing suppliers for our products, or we may be unable to find alternative suppliers for key product components or ancillary items at reasonably comparable prices. If this occurs, we may be unable to manufacture our products and/or meet our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner or at all.\nAdditionally, we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components. If our suppliers discontinue production of a key component for one or more of our products, we may be unable to identify or secure a viable alternative on reasonable terms, or at all, which could limit our ability to manufacture our products. While we may be able to modify our product candidates to utilize a new source of components, we may need to secure marketing authorization from the FDA or other regulatory clearance for the modified product, and it could take considerable time and expense to perform the requisite tasks prior to seeking such authorization.\nIn determining the required quantities of our products and our manufacturing schedule, we will need to make significant judgments and estimates regarding factors such as market trends and any seasonality with respect to our sales. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products that we require. This can result in shortages if we fail to anticipate demand, or excess inventory and write-offs if we order more than we need.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risk to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\npossible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\npossible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers;\n\u2022\npossible termination or non-renewal of agreements by third parties, based on their own business priorities, at times that are costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe potential obsolescence and/or inability of our suppliers to obtain required components;\n\u2022\nthe potential delays and expenses of seeking alternate sources of supply or manufacturing services;\n\u2022\nthe inability to qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims of our products;\n\u2022\nreduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternate suppliers or assemblers; and\n\u2022\nincreases in prices of raw materials and key components.\nThe manufacturing operations for the Accelerate Pheno system use highly technical processes involving unique, proprietary techniques. In addition, the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to repair or replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Any interruption in our operations or decrease in the production capacity of our manufacturing facility or the facilities of any of our suppliers because of equipment failure, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and fires, or otherwise, would limit our ability to meet customer demand for our products. In the event of a disruption, we may lose customers and we may be unable to regain those customers thereafter. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have made and intend to make significant additional investments in research and development, but there is no guarantee that any of these investments will ultimately result in a commercial product that will generate revenues.\nThe Accelerate Pheno system integrates several of our component products, systems and processes. We have dedicated significant resources on research and development activities, and we intend to spend significantly more on research and development activities. Notwithstanding these investments, we anticipate that we will have to spend additional funds in the research and development of the Accelerate Pheno system, particularly with respect to its use for additional specimen types. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA of the Accelerate Pheno system for its use with additional specimen types. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to develop additional types of tests and instruments in the future.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nLegislative and Administrative Action May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Company\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. We cannot predict what other legislation relating to our business or to the health care industry may be enacted, including legislation relating to third-party reimbursement, or what effect such legislation may have on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We expect federal and state legislators to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems, and possibly adopt legislation affecting further changes in the health care delivery system. Such laws may contain provisions that may change the operating environment for hospitals and managed care organizations. Health care industry participants may react to such legislation by curtailing or deferring expenditures and initiatives, including those relating to our products. Future legislation could result in modifications to the existing public and private health care insurance systems that would have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement policies discussed above. If enacted and implemented, any measures to restrict health care spending could result in decreased revenue from our products and decrease potential returns from our research and development initiatives. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully neutralize any lobbying efforts against any initiatives we may have with governmental agencies.\nWe and our suppliers, contract manufacturers and customers are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, and experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of, these laws and regulations.\nOur operations are affected by various state, federal, and international healthcare, environmental, anti-corruption, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), privacy, and employment laws as well as international political sanctions. Violations of these laws and sanctions can result in criminal or civil penalties, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In some cases, the violation of such laws could potentially lead to individual liability and imprisonment.\nWe are also subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Following the introduction of a product, these and other government agencies will periodically review our manufacturing processes, product performance and compliance with applicable requirements.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. healthcare related laws regulating sales, contracting, marketing, and other business arrangements and the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information. These include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending, furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\n\u2022\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which prohibits knowingly and willfully (i) executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers, or (ii) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for items or services under a health care benefit program.\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which also restricts the use and disclosure of protected health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of protected health information, and requires us to report certain security breaches to health care provider customers with respect to such information where we are acting as a HIPAA business associate to that customer.\n\u2022\nThe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of certain medical devices to track payments or other transfers of value given to U.S. licensed physicians or teaching hospitals and to report this data to CMS annually for subsequent public disclosure.\n\u2022\nThe federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery.\nSimilar requirements have been adopted by many states and foreign countries. Violations of any of these laws can lead to additional legal risk such as risk of plaintiff class actions, state Attorney General actions, and investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, among others.\nFailure to comply with applicable requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes, including our failure or the failure of one of our contract manufacturers to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, can result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nadministrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\nreportable events;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution; and\n\u2022\nexclusion or debarment from participation in federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from marketing, distributing and selling our products.\nIn addition, we have developed, configured and we intend to market our products to meet customer needs created by these various regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products. Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise adversely impact our ability\nto market our products. If materials used in our products become unavailable because of new governmental regulations, substitute materials may be less effective and may require significant cost to incorporate in our product.\nIn addition, a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by us. We believe that the FDA would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception. Regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. Any recall would divert management attention and financial resources, could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline, expose us to product liability or other claims (including contractual claims from parties to whom we sold products) and harm our reputation with customers.\nThe use of our diagnostic products by our customers is also affected by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\u201cCLIA\u201d) and related federal and state regulations that provide for regulation of laboratory testing. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality assurance, quality control and inspections. Current or future CLIA requirements or the promulgation of additional regulations affecting laboratory testing may prevent some laboratories, hospitals, providers or other customers with laboratories from using some or all of our diagnostic products.\nMaintaining adequate sales of our product may depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement to our customers from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, and managed care programs.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our product, if approved, may depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement to our customers from third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Hospitals, clinical laboratories and other healthcare provider customers that may purchase our products generally bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products. We currently expect that all of our diagnostic tests will be performed in a hospital inpatient setting, where governmental payers, such as Medicare, generally reimburse hospitals a single bundled payment that is based on the patient\u2019s diagnosis under a classification system known as the Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (MS-DRGs) classification for all items and services provided to the patient during a single hospitalization, regardless of whether our diagnostic tests are performed during such hospitalization. As a result, our customers\u2019 access to adequate payment by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our products. We may be unable to sell our products, if approved, on a profitable basis if third-party payers reduce their current levels of payment or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.\nAdditionally, third-party payers are increasingly reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have and may continue to implement cost-containment measures and more restrictive policies, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the \u201cBudget Control Act\u201d) established a process to reduce federal budget deficits through an automatic \u201csequestration\u201d process if deficit reductions targets are not otherwise reached. Under the terms of the Budget Control Act, sequestration imposes cuts to a wide range of federal programs, including Medicare, which is subject to a two percent cut. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended the two percent sequestration cut for Medicare through fiscal year 2023, and a bill signed by President Obama on February 15, 2014 further extended this cut for an additional year, through fiscal year 2024. For fiscal year 2024, however, Medicare sequestration amounts will be realigned such that there will be a four percent sequester for the first six months and no sequester for the second six months, under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014.\nWhile we cannot predict whether third-party reimbursement to our customers will be adequate, cost-containment measures and similar efforts by third-party payers, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, could substantially impact the sales of our products and potentially limit our net revenue and results.\nWe may be adversely affected by healthcare policy changes, including additional healthcare reform and changes in managed healthcare.\nHealthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been considerable forces in the medical diagnostics industry and in recent political discussions. These forces have placed, and are expected to continue to place, constraints on the levels of overall pricing for healthcare products and services as well as the coverage available\nby public and private insurance and thus, could have a material adverse effect on the future profit margins of our products or the amounts that we are able to receive from third parties for the licensing of our products. Changes in the United States healthcare market could also force us to alter our approach to selling, marketing, distributing and servicing our products and customer base. In and outside the United States, changes to government reimbursement policies could reduce the funding that healthcare service providers have available for diagnostic product expenditures, which could have a material adverse impact on the use of the products we are developing and our future sales, license and royalty fees and profit margin.\nFor example, the ACA requires CMS to reduce payments to hospitals reimbursed under Medicare\u2019s Inpatient Prospective Payment System (\u201cIPPS\u201d) that have excess readmissions. This and other applicable requirements set forth under the ACA and its current and future implementing regulations may significantly increase our costs, and/or reduce our customer\u2019s ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for tests performed with our products, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition to direct impacts from reimbursement cuts, sales of our products could be negatively impacted if reimbursement cuts reduce microbiology budgets. While the ACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, other elements of this legislation that are still being developed and refined, such as Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, make it difficult to determine the overall impact on sales of our products. In addition to uncertainty regarding the impact of implementation of the ACA, there are some continued legal challenges to the ACA that, if successful, could call into question the legitimacy of the ACA and its future applicability. Further, the current White House administration has at times threatened to challenge or repeal the ACA, although the scope and timing of any legislation to repeal, amend, replace or reform the ACA is uncertain.\nIn recent years, other legislative, regulatory, and political changes aimed at regulating healthcare delivery in general and clinical laboratory tests in particular have been proposed and adopted in the United States. Reimbursement for the laboratory industry is under significant pressure. In January 2015, HHS announced a plan to shift the Medicare program and the healthcare system at large, toward paying providers based on quality, rather than the quantity of care provided to patients. In 2017, Medicare\u2019s clinical laboratory reimbursement system became tied to private market rates with the start of the effective period for the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d), changing the payment environment for clinical laboratory tests. The measures implemented by PAMA and ACA regulations can result in reduced prices, added costs, and decreased test utilization for our customers, although the full impact on our business of the ACA, changes to the IPPS, PAMA, and other applicable laws, regulations, and policies is uncertain.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation will have on our industry generally, our ability to successfully commercialize the Accelerate Pheno system, and our overall business operations. Continued changes in healthcare policy could substantially impact the sales of our tests, increase costs and divert management\u2019s attention from our business. For example, any expansion in the government\u2019s regulation of the United States healthcare system could result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursements to our customers for laboratory testing or reduced medical procedure volumes.\nThe regulatory processes applicable to our products and operations are expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of our products.\nOur products, including the Accelerate Pheno system, are regulated as medical device products by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries. In particular, FDA regulations govern activities such as product development, product testing, product labeling, product storage, premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, product sales, reporting of certain product failures and distribution. Some of our products, depending on their intended use, will require approval of a premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d) or clearance of a 510(k) notification from the FDA prior to marketing. The FDA has committed to review most 510(k) decisions within 90 days, but the review may be delayed due to requests for additional information. A decision may take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA has committed to review most PMAs within 180 days where an advisory panel is not required and within 320 days where an advisory panel is required, but the review may be delayed due to requests for additional information. A decision may take significantly longer, and approval is never assured. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on extensive data, including technical,\npreclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. However, some devices are automatically subject to the PMA pathway regardless of the level of risk they pose, because they have not previously been classified into a lower risk class by the FDA. Manufacturers of these devices may request that the FDA review such devices in accordance with the de novo classification procedure, which allows a manufacturer whose novel device would otherwise require the submission and approval of a PMA prior to marketing to request down-classification of the device on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk. If the FDA agrees with the down-classification, the applicant will then receive authorization to market the device. This device type can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our product candidates are safe and effective, sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, for their intended users;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we or our contract manufacturers use may not meet applicable requirements.\nWith respect to those future products where a PMA is not required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain 510(k) clearances with respect to those products. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals, or completing the de novo classification process, to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully obtain pre-market reviews on a timely basis, if at all. Further, even if we were to obtain regulatory clearance, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses.\nClinical trial data is typically required to support a PMA and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. Clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted for any number of reasons, including product performance, changes in intended use, changes in medical practice and the opinion of evaluator Institutional Review Boards.\nAdditionally, since 2009, the FDA has significantly increased the scrutiny applied to its oversight of companies subject to its regulations by hiring new investigators and increasing inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has also undertaken initiatives related to enhancement of the 510(k) review process and has proposed significant changes to the regulation of laboratory developed tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d). We continue to monitor these developments and analyze how they will impact the approval of our products. These and other actions proposed by the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health could result in significant changes to the 510(k) process, which could complicate the product approval process, although we cannot predict the effect of such changes and cannot ascertain if such changes will have a substantive impact on the approval of our products. If we fail to adequately respond to the increased scrutiny and streamlined 510(k) submission process, our business may be adversely impacted.\nFailure to comply with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance or PMA for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. With regard to products for which we seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval from the FDA, any failure or material delay to obtain such clearance or approval could harm our business. If the FDA were to disagree with our regulatory assessment and conclude that approval or clearance is necessary to market the products, we could be forced to cease marketing the products and seek approval or clearance. Once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product, there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to be met.\nIn addition, it is possible that the current regulatory framework could change or additional regulations could arise at any stage during our product development or marketing, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the program,\nand in January 2011, announced several proposed actions intended to reform the review process governing the clearance of medical devices. The FDA undertook these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \u201cMedical Device Regulatory Improvements\u201d and miscellaneous reforms that are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our product candidates could prevent us from generating revenue from these product candidates. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our product candidates and dissuade our customers from using our product candidates, if and when they are authorized for marketing.\nOur manufacturing facility located in Tucson, Arizona, where we assemble and produce the Accelerate Pheno system, is subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other federal and state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, this facility is subject to Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) of the FDA and is subject to annual inspection and licensing by the State of Arizona. If we fail to maintain this facility in accordance with the QSR requirements, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, our manufacturing process could be suspended or terminated, which would prevent us from being able to provide products to our customers in a timely fashion.\nSales of our diagnostic product candidates outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical studies, vigilance reporting, marketing approval, manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement. These regulatory requirements vary greatly from country to country. As a result, the time required to obtain approvals outside the United States may differ from that required to obtain FDA marketing authorization from the FDA, and we may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Marketing authorization from the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. Foreign regulatory authorities could require additional testing. For example, we are currently seeking regulatory approval in China for our Accelerate Pheno system. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements, or to obtain required clearances or approvals, could impair our ability to commercialize our diagnostic product candidates outside of the United States.\nGlobal health crises, such as currently being experienced in some geographies with Coronavirus, may divert regulatory resources and attention away from approval processes for our products. This could materially lengthen the regulatory approval process of new products, which would delay expected commercialization of such new products.\nModifications to our products, if cleared or approved, may require new 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained.\nAny modification to a device authorized for marketing that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA supplement or new PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, PMA supplements or PMAs for modifications to previously cleared or approved products for which we conclude that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to any products for which we obtain clearance, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. The practical impact of the FDA\u2019s continuing scrutiny of the 510(k) program remains unclear.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct studies of our products that may be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe rely on third parties, including medical investigators, to conduct studies on our products. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities. These third parties may not complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. If applicable, our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of any applicable requirement to prepare, and ensure compliance with, various procedures required under good clinical practices. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA or regulatory clearance for our products.\nA recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products that leads to corrective actions, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Under the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources, have an adverse effect on our reputation, and may impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. Depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide that we will need to obtain, new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face significant adverse publicity or regulatory consequences, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile and traded on low volumes.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. Factors that may contribute to volatility in the price of our common stock include, but are not limited to: (i) low trading volume currently prevailing in the market for our shares; (ii) concentration of our stock with one individual large shareholder who could decide to materially reduce his position; and (iii) the substantial current short interest in our stock. The market value of your investment in our common stock may rise or fall sharply at any time because of this volatility and also because of significant short positions that may be taken by investors from time to time in our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the sale price for our common stock ranged from $11.76 to $23.92 per share, and during the year ended December 31, 2018, the sale price for our common stock ranged from $10.42 to $29.90 per share. The market prices for securities of medical technology companies like us historically have been highly volatile, and the market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThe short interest in our common stock is high, which may lead to further volatility in our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the number of shares of our common stock shorted was high as compared to the number of shares in the public float. A significant concentration of short interest can be a contributing factor resulting in high volatility in our stock price and volume fluctuations.\nThe ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our directors and executive officers, together with members of their immediate families, as a group, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 47% of our outstanding capital stock, including 28% beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by our director, Jack Schuler. As a result, these stockholders will be able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership also contributes to the low trading volume and volatility of our common stock. In late 2018 and into 2019 major shareholders of Accelerate were encouraged to hold their shares in certificate form.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our shares and be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of our common stock. Any sales by us or by our existing stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The exercise of any options or warrants, the issuance of our common stock in connection with acquisitions and other issuances of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. In addition, we have a significant number of options and warrants outstanding. If the holders of these options or warrants exercise such securities, you may incur further dilution.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, and you may incur dilution to your stock holdings.\nWe have primarily relied upon capital from the sale of our securities to fund our operations. Although we have now commercialized the Accelerate Pheno system in the United States, Europe, and certain other regions, there can be no assurance that our commercialization efforts will be successful or that we will not continue to incur operating losses. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently forecast by management, we may require additional capital sooner than expected. We may also require additional capital in the future to expand our product offerings, expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, increase our manufacturing capacity, fund our operations, and continue our research and development activities. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA or clearance from the FDA to market our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates, if cleared;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe ability of healthcare providers to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers for procedures using our products;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of marketing authorization or regulatory clearances;\n\u2022\nthe cost of goods associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe cost of customer disruptions due to supply disruptions;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates.\nIf we require additional capital, we may attempt to raise it through a variety of strategies, including the issuance and sale of additional shares of our common stock. Issuances of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock in the future, whether in connection with a rights offering, follow-on offering or otherwise, would dilute existing stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our product development.\nIf we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may be required to delay additional product development or license to third parties the rights to commercialize our products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize ourselves. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our product candidates or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nNegative reports issued by securities analysts, and the election by securities analysts not to cover us, may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business, and our failure to achieve analyst earnings estimates. It may be difficult for companies such as ours, with smaller market capitalizations, to attract securities analysts that will cover our common stock. The lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price may decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future debt agreements may also preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may delay or prevent acquisition of our Company, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. For example, our board of directors may fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise. Stockholders may only take action by written consent if acting unanimously. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the President, a Vice President, our board of directors or the holders of not less than one-tenth of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting. Additionally, our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to fix the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series, the voting powers, if any, of the shares of such series, and the preferences and relative, participating,\noptional or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares. Moreover, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nRisks Related to our Convertible Senior Notes\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes.\nOn March 27, 2018, the Company issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company granted the initial purchasers of the Notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes on the same terms and conditions. On April 4, 2018 the option was partially exercised, which resulted in $21.5 million of additional proceeds, for total proceeds of $171.5 million. As a result of this Notes offering, we incurred $171.5 million principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity in 2023. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, the indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under the indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to Maturity Date for the Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, this indebtedness could, among other things:\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and heightened competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes.\nOur failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise under the indenture) or pay cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nTo the extent we choose to deliver shares upon conversion of the Notes, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. To the extent we choose to deliver shares upon conversion of some or all of the Notes, this will result in a dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may depress our stock price.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the Notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. In addition, the Notes may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nThe prepaid forward we entered into in connection with the Notes offering may affect the value of our common stock and may result in unexpected market activity in our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into a prepaid forward with the forward counterparty. The prepaid forward is intended to reduce the dilution to our stockholders from the issuance of our common stock (if any) upon conversion of the Notes and to allow certain investors to establish short positions that generally correspond to commercially reasonable initial hedges of their investment in the Notes. In addition, the forward counterparty (or its affiliate) may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding one or more derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions at any time, including following the offering of the Notes and immediately prior to or shortly after March 15, 2023, the maturity date of the Notes (and are likely to unwind their derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our common stock in connection with any conversion or repurchase of the Notes and/or in connection with the purchase or sale of notes by certain investors). These activities could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nThe prepaid forward initially facilitated privately negotiated derivative transactions relating to our common stock, including derivative transactions by which investors in the Notes established short positions relating to our common stock to hedge their investments in the Notes concurrently with, or shortly after, the placement of the Notes. Neither we nor the forward counterparty control how such investors may use such derivative transactions. In addition, such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of our common stock, at any time. As a result, the existence of the prepaid forward, such derivative transactions, and any related market activity could cause more sales of our common stock over the term of the prepaid forward than there would have otherwise been had we not entered into the prepaid forward. Such sales could potentially affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the prepaid forward. We will be subject to the risk that the forward counterparty might default under the prepaid forward.\nWe are subject to the risk that the forward counterparty might default under the prepaid forward. Our exposure to the credit risk of the forward counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the forward counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the forward counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the forward counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the forward counterparty to the prepaid forward.", "PERMNO": 84184, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "AXDX"}
