RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nWe routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors' reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.\nChanges in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.\nA large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of economic factors including, but not limited to: interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values, rising food and energy costs, and higher personal taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.\nThe retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, electronics and appliance retailers with limited furniture products, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as COSTCO also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the Internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer.\nCompetition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.\nOur products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed delivery dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory.\nWe import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.\nBased on product costs, approximately 60% of our total furniture purchases in 2015 were for goods not produced domestically. All of our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such price increases, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:\n\u00b7\nwe could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;\n\u00b7\nif we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or\n\u00b7\nwe may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.\nSignificant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.\nThe primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors' costs and our profits as discussed above.\nWe are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.\nWe source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.\nWe also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.\nOur vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.\nAll of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities. These could harm our brand's image and negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain.\nDisruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.\nThe rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.\nA significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. We deliver substantially all of our customers' purchases to their homes. Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 16 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent.\nIf transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.\nBecause of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.\nWe utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements, but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.\nOur information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.\nOur ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, credit operations and distribution system, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, manage our credit portfolio and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers' homes. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7\npower loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;\n\u00b7\noperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u00b7\nphysical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;\n\u00b7\ncomputer viruses;\n\u00b7\nintentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and\n\u00b7\ntornadoes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.\nAny failure due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan and redundant systems, could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and profitability.\nWe may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information.\nWe accept electronic payment cards in our stores and over the internet. Amounts tendered through payment card transactions represented approximately 56% of our business in 2015.\nWe may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.", "PERMNO": 41217, "SIC": 5712, "TIC": "HVT"}
