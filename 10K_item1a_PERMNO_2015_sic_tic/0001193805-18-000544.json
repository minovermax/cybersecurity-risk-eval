{"cik": "1009891", "company": "AIR INDUSTRIES GROUP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe purchase of our common stock involves a very high degree of risk.\nIn evaluating us and our business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. If any of the events described in the risks below actually occurs, our financial condition or operating results may be materially and adversely affected, the price of our common stock may decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or a part of your investment.\nThe risks below can be characterized into three groups:\n1) Risks related to our business, including risks specific to the defense and aerospace industry:\n2) Risks arising from our indebtedness; and\n3) Risks related to our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe incurred substantial net losses in 2017 and 2016 and may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe suffered net losses from operations of $12,758,000 and $10,135,000 and net losses of $ 22,551,000 and $15,623,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also had negative cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In 2015 we ceased paying dividends on our common stock and in 2016 we disposed of the real estate on which one of our operating subsidiaries is located through a sale leaseback transaction. In January 2017, we sold one of our operating subsidiaries. Recently we have entered in a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell our operating subsidiaries constituting our Aerostructures & Electronics segment. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent thereto, we sold in excess of $ 29,856,000 in debt and equity securities to secure funds to operate our business. Since February 2017 we have issued additional convertible notes in lieu of cash payment of accrued interest on our outstanding convertible notes. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2017, we were not in compliance with financial covenants under our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with PNC Bank (the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d). The report of our independent registered public accountants on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 states that these factors raise uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nUnless we are able to generate positive cash flows from operations, we will continue to depend upon further issuances of debt, equity or other financings to fund ongoing operations. In November 2017 through January 2018, we issued 1,577,390 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 480,000 shares of common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of $2,000,000. We may continue to incur additional operating losses and we cannot assure you that we will continue as a going concern.\nIn late fiscal 2017, we initiated a repositioning of our business to obtain profitability and improve our liquidity. We named a new CEO and on March 21, 2018, we entered into an SPA for the sale of WMI and related operations for a purchase price of $9,000,000, subject to a working capital adjustment. Although we believe the proceeds of this disposition will improve our liquidity, we still may need to depend on further issuances of debt or equity to fund ongoing operations until we achieve sustainable profitability and positive cash flow.\nRisk that sale of WMI may not close.\nWe are depending upon the sale of WMI to improve our cash position. The sale is anticipated to close in May or June 2018, although it is possible the disposition may be delayed. The sale is subject to certain conditions and both parties have limited termination provisions. Nevertheless management expects that the sale will be consummated, though there is no guarantee it will occur.\nWe may need additional financing.\nIn the past, we have funded a portion of our operating losses through borrowings from two of our principal shareholders who are also directors. As of December 31, 2017, related party notes payable to Michael and Robert Taglich (and their affiliated entities), totaled $2,388,000. In the future, we may need additional cash to fund operational losses and bridge financing until the sale of WMI closes. Additional funding may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties or our two principal shareholders. If we are unable to fund such losses from third parties or our principal shareholders, we may become insolvent.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future. Future financings may involve the issuance of debt, equity and/or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities. These financings may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all when and as we require funding. If we are able to consummate such financings, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected and/or the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. Any failure to obtain additional working capital when required would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and may result in a decline in our stock price. Any issuances of our common stock, preferred stock, or securities such as warrants or notes that are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, our capital stock, would have a dilutive effect on the voting and economic interest of our existing stockholders.\nWe have identified deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls and we may not be successful in remediating these deficiencies and weakness in the near future.\nIn connection with our review of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of such dates. In particular, certain portions of our inventory control system have not been integrated into the system used by the balance of our company which could result in a failure to properly account for the costs associated with work in process, slow moving inventory and the value of inventory on hand, and the enterprise reporting system used to track employee hours. Accordingly, costs to be included in work in process, may not be sufficiently automated to ensure compliance at all times. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our quarterly closing process was deficient at our subsidiaries and that our consolidating process and period end reporting and disclosure procedures were materially weak. They also concluded that our system for administering and disclosing stock compensation was deficient and that we lacked the accounting personnel necessary to account for complex accounting matters and unusual and nonstandard transactions. We intend to remediate these conditions. In the event we do not remediate these deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls, our operations may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to maintain our listing on the NYSE American.\nA reduction in government spending on defense could materially adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nA large percentage of our revenue is derived from products for US military aviation. There are risks associated with programs that are subject to appropriation by Congress, which could be potential targets for reductions in funding. Reductions in United States Government spending on defense or future changes in the mix of defense products required by United States Government agencies could limit demand for our products, and may have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. For the past several years, our operations have been impacted by volatility in government procurement cycles and spending patterns. There can be no assurance that our financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely impacted by future volatility in defense spending or a change in the mix of products purchased by defense departments in the United States or other countries, or the perception on the part of our customers that such changes are about to occur.\nWe depend on revenues from a few significant relationships. Any loss, cancellation, reduction, or interruption in these relationships could harm our business.\nWe derive most of our revenues from a small number of customers. Three customers represented approximately 62% and 52.3% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of customers which have contracts with United States governmental agencies, thereby limiting the number of potential customers. Our success depends on our ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our largest customers or that we will be able to attract additional customers, or that our customers will continue to buy our products in the same amounts as in prior years. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or interruption in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may have to make, could significantly harm our business.\nWe depend on revenues from components for a few aircraft platforms and the cancellation or reduction of either production or use of these aircraft platforms could harm our business.\nOur Complex Machining segment derives most of its revenues from components for a few aircraft platforms, specifically the Sikorsky BlackHawk helicopter, the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye naval aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas (Boeing) C-17 Globemaster, the Falcon and the Hornet. Boeing closed its C-17 production line in 2015. A reduction in demand for our products as a result of either a reduction in the production of new aircraft or a reduction in the use of existing aircraft in the fleet (reducing after-market demand) would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIntense competition in our markets may lead to a reduction in our revenues and market share.\nThe defense and aerospace component manufacturing market is highly competitive and we expect that competition will increase and perhaps intensify. Many competitors have significantly greater technical, manufacturing, financial and marketing resources than we do. We may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors. Increased competition could result in reduced revenue, lower margins or loss of market share, any of which could significantly harm our business, our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may lose sales if our suppliers fail to meet our needs or shipments of raw materials are not timely made.\nAlthough we procure most of our parts and components from multiple sources or believe that these components are readily available from numerous sources, certain components are available only from a sole or limited number or sources. While we believe that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained, use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require us to re-engineer our products, or both, which could delay shipment of our products and could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Recently, we have had difficulties in securing timely shipments of raw materials from certain vendors due to our liquidity problems. Our results of operations for the past few years have been negatively impacted by disruptions in receipt of materials and such disruptions may continue. Any delays in the shipment of raw materials could significantly harm our business, our operating results and our financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with the bidding processes in which we compete.\nWe obtain many contracts through a competitive bidding process. We must devote substantial time and resources to prepare bids and proposals and may not have contracts awarded to us. Even if we win contracts, there can be no assurance that the prices that we have bid will be sufficient to allow us to generate a profit from any particular contract. There are significant costs involved with producing a small number of initial units of any new product and it may not be possible to recoup such costs on later production runs.\nDue to fixed contract pricing, increasing contract costs expose us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.\nThe cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials we use are volatile.\nThe prices of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are volatile. If the prices of raw materials rise we may not be able to pass along such increases to our customers and this could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. It is possible that some of the raw materials we use might become subject to new or increased tariffs. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials could adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand for certain products which could lead to a reduction in our revenues and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nSome of the products we produce have long lead times.\nSome of the products we produce, particularly those of our Complex Machining segment, require months to produce and we sometimes produce products in excess of the number ordered intending to sell the excess as spares when orders arise. As a result, our inventory turns slowly and ties up our working capital. Our inventory represented approximately 51% of our assets as of December 31, 2017. Any requirement to write down the value of our inventory due to obsolescence or a drop in the price of materials could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and could result in a breach of the financial covenants in our Loan Facility.\nWe do not own the intellectual property rights to products we produce.\nNearly all the parts and subassemblies we produce are built to customer specifications and the customer owns the intellectual property, if any, related to the product. Consequently, if a customer desires to use another manufacturer to fabricate its part or subassembly, it would be free to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our operating results and financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs typically carry risks associated with design changes, acquisition of new production tools, funding commitments, imprecise or changing specifications, timing delays and the accuracy of cost estimates associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may experience delays for a variety of reasons after significant expenditures are made. If we were unable to perform under new programs to the customers\u2019 satisfaction or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or other problems, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. This could result in low margin or forward loss contracts, and the risk of having to write-off costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts if it were deemed to be unrecoverable over the life of the program.\nTo perform on new programs we may be required to incur material up-front costs which may not have been separately negotiated and may not be recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity.\nThe need to control our expenses will place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. If we are unable to control our expenses effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAttracting and retaining executive talent and other key personnel is an essential element of our future success.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract executive talent, as well as the continued service of our existing executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Experienced management and technical, marketing and support personnel in the defense and aerospace industries are in demand and competition for their talents is intense. Our failure to attract executive talent, or retain our existing executive officers and key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to strict governmental regulations relating to the environment, which could result in fines and remediation expense in the event of non-compliance.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. In addition, these regulations may impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our facilities without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. Furthermore, we are required to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances. Our operations require the use of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning that are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. If we are found to be in violation of any of these rules, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines, remediation expenses and the obligation to change our business practice, any of which could result in substantial costs that would adversely impact our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to fines and disqualification for non-compliance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have never been subject to such fines or disqualification.\nTerrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnited States and global responses to actual or potential military conflicts, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats and other global political crises increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets. Several factors associated, directly or indirectly, with actual or potential military conflicts, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats, and other global political crises and responses thereto, may adversely affect the mix of products purchased by defense departments in the United States or other countries to platforms not serviced by us. A shift in defense budgets to product lines we do not produce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness under our Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $19,926,000 of indebtedness outstanding under the Loan Facility. All of our indebtedness under the Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nWe also have outstanding a significant amount of indebtedness in the form of 8% Notes. To the extent we are not able to pay accrued interest on the 8% Notes in cash due to restrictions set forth in the Loan Facility or otherwise, we may issue additional 8% Notes in payment of such accrued interest in lieu of cash (\u201cPIK Notes\u201d). If we are unable to pay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the 8% Notes when due, our operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur leverage may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and capital needs, may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and may make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nWe currently do not pay dividends and the terms of our Loan Facility require that we maintain certain financial covenants. Unless we are in compliance with our Loan Facility in the future, we would need to seek covenant changes under our Loan Facility to pay dividends in the future. There can be no assurance our lenders would agree to covenant changes acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may in the future incur indebtedness or otherwise become subject to agreements whose terms restrict our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nRisks Related to our common stock\nThe ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated, and your interests may conflict with the interests of our existing stockholders.\nTwo of our directors, Michael N. Taglich and Robert F. Taglich, and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 24.70% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, these directors have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, these directors have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. The interests of these directors may be different from the interests of other stockholders on these matters. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock.\nA large number of shares may be sold in the market as a result of the Public Offering and the resale of the Shares offered in our public offering and resale Prospectus of July and August 2017, respectively. This may depress the market price of our common stock.\nA substantial number of our shares of common stock, including 5,175,000 shares sold in a public offering in July 2017 and 1,293,938 shares issued upon conversion of our bridge notes issued in May 2018, are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. In addition, 8,629,606 shares issued in October 2017 upon the automatic conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock held by non-affiliates, are eligible for sale in accordance with Rule 144, without restriction. As a result, a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold in the public market, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to meet NYSE American listing requirements. If we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of the NYSE American, our common stock could be delisted.\nHowever, we may fail to timely file a periodic report or other required SEC filing in the future and as a result may fail to be in compliance in the future. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, the NYSE American may take steps to delist our common stock. The delisting of our common stock would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase common stock when you wish to do so.\nThere is only a limited public market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American. However, trading volume has been limited and a more active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained over time. The lack of a robust market may impair a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell shares of our common stock. In the absence of a more active trading market, any attempt to sell a substantial number of our shares could result in a decrease in the price of our stock. Specifically, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares or at all.\nMoreover, sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the price of our common stock. As a result, you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all, and the price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur future revenues are inherently unpredictable; our operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline significantly.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of performance. Some of the factors that could cause quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include conditions inherent in government contracting and our business such as the timing of cost and expense recognition for contracts, the United States Government contracting and budget cycles, introduction of new government regulations and standards, contract closeouts, variations in manufacturing efficiencies, our ability to obtain components and subassemblies from contract manufacturers and suppliers, general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the defense market. Because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our business.\nFluctuations in quarterly results, competition or announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation may cause earnings to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock, as well as our overall operating results. Consequently, our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance.\nWe are currently unable to pay cash dividends on our common stock and are not likely to do so for the foreseeable future\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited by the terms of our Loan Facility (and the terms of any future indebtedness or other agreements), under applicable law, and our status as a holding company. Given our current cash needs, it is not likely we will pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nFuture financings or acquisitions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales or issuances of our common stock, including upon conversion of the 8% Notes, upon exercise of our outstanding warrants or as part of future financings or acquisitions, would be substantially dilutive to the outstanding shares of common stock. Any dilution or potential dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the price of common stock.\nFuture issuances of additional 8% Notes in lieu of cash interest payments on our 8% Notes will dilute existing holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are obligated to pay accrued interest quarterly to holders of our 8% Notes. To date, we have issued additional 8% Notes in lieu of cash payments of accrued interest (\u201cPIK Notes\u201d). If for any future interest periods we are unable to pay accrued interest on the 8% Notes in cash due to restrictions in our Loan Facility or liquidity constraints, we may issue additional PIK Notes to holders of our 8% Notes. The conversion of PIK Notes into common stock will dilute the interests of our common stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to companies having a public float of less than $75 million, for as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. During that period, we are permitted to omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Companies with a public float of $75 million or more must otherwise procure such an attestation beginning with their second annual report after their initial public offering. For as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we also are excluded from the requirement to submit \u201csay-on-pay\u201d, \u201csay-on-pay frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-parachute\u201d votes to our stockholders and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure compared to larger companies. In addition, as described in the following risk factor, as an emerging growth company we can take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.\nUntil such time as we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we may take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that, as an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Please refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for further discussion of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nAt such time as we cease to qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, the costs and demands placed upon management will increase.\nWe will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2018 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under a registration statement under the Securities Act,) (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u2018large accelerated filer\u2019 as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon our attaining a public float of at least $700 million. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements, particularly if our public float should exceed $75 million.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to comply with these requirements.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable market regulators. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline if investors and others lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other applicable regulatory authorities.", "PERMNO": 13976, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "AIRI"}
