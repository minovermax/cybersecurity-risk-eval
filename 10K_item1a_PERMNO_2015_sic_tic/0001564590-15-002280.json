Risk Factors\nIn your evaluation of our Company and business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with information included elsewhere within this Annual Report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as our ability to collect receivables, overall U.S. and global economic and industry conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business, financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock. Should any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face the following risks in connection with the general conditions and trends of the industry in which we operate:\nWe depend on U.S. government agencies as our primary customer and, if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenues, cash flow and financial results would be adversely affected.\nWe generated over 90% of our total revenues during each of the last three fiscal years from contracts with the U.S. government, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. We generated over 70% of our total revenues during each of the last three fiscal years from the DoD, including 28% and 20% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015 from the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, respectively (although each of these customers has a number of subordinate agencies which have separate budgets and procurement functions). We expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under U.S. government contracts. Our reputation and relationship with the U.S. government, and in particular with the agencies of the DoD, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues. Negative press reports or publicity, which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct, conflicts of interest, poor contract performance, deficiencies in services, reports, or other deliverables, information security breaches or other aspects of our business, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation, particularly with these agencies. In addition, negative publicity regarding our work for state and local government and commercial customers may harm our reputation with these customers as well as with our federal government customers. If our reputation is negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our future revenues, cash flow, and financial results would be adversely affected.\nA decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues, cash flow and financial results.\nSince we generate most of our revenues from contracts with U.S. government agencies, our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the U.S. government, as well as by delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts. Current U.S. government spending levels for defense-related and other programs may not be sustained, and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of shifts in spending priorities from defense-related and other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds and the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act) enacted 10-year discretionary spending caps which are expected to generate over $1 trillion in savings for the U.S. government, approximately half of which comes from DoD baseline spending reductions. The caps set in motion automatic across-the-board spending cuts (referred to as sequestration) for government fiscal year (GFY) 2013 which resulted in a $37 billion reduction to defense budget authority. The impacts of sequestration from cuts to budget authority in GFY 2013 will continue to be felt in GFY 2015 as those reductions in budget authority are translated into further reductions in budget outlays.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nIn December 2013, Congress and the Administration enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Bipartisan Budget Act), which increased the limits on discretionary spending for GFY 2014 and GFY 2015 imposed by the Budget Control Act. However, the Bipartisan Budget Act did not address the lower spending limits, including the across-the-board spending reduction methodology, for GFYs 2016 through 2021 as provided for in the Budget Control Act. Unless Congress and the Administration can reach a new agreement this year, the full effect of sequestration will once again take effect in GFY 2016. The implementation of further automatic spending cuts may reduce, delay or cancel funding for certain of our contracts and programs and could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nOn February 2, 2015, President Obama released his GFY 2016 budget proposal which sets defense discretionary spending at $1.087 trillion, with $561 billon for defense and $526 billion for non-defense. This is about $71 billion, or 7%, above the budgetary caps imposed by the Budget Control Act. The President\u2019s proposal would eliminate the sequester for GFY 2016 and future years through a series of ten year offsets that include trimming certain mandatory and discretionary programs by $600 billion, raising nearly $640 billion in new tax revenue, and implementing an immigration overhaul plan that estimates say would save approximately $160 billion. It is unclear, however, whether Congress will enact some or any of the President\u2019s proposed budget increases and there remains uncertainty regarding how sequester cuts in GFY 2016 and beyond will be applied to the DoD and other agencies. The President\u2019s budget proposal also includes $58 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. OCO dollars are intended to support critical national defense efforts and are not subject to sequestration. The GFY 2016 OCO total represents a decrease of about 21% from GFY 2015. If adopted, this total would further restrict available discretionary defense funding.\nIn years when the U.S. government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, government operations typically are funded through one or more continuing resolutions that authorize agencies of the U.S. government to continue to operate, but do not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in contract awards due to lack of funding. This was recently the case for DHS, which was funded through a series of short-term continuing resolutions into March 2015. It was only then that Congress and the Administration reached an agreement on funding for the remainder of the GFY.\nShould a continuing resolution be used to fund all or some U.S. government operations after GFY 2015 it may cause additional government contract awards to be delayed, canceled, or funded at lower levels and could adversely impact our operations, cash flow and financial results.\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities, which may shift DoD budgetary priorities, reduce overall U.S. government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs, including programs from which we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues. In addition, changes to the DoD acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so. A significant decline in overall U.S. government spending, including in areas of national security, a significant shift in its spending priorities, the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defense-related programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects.\nOur reputation may be harmed or other adverse consequences may be incurred by us relating to former Parent\u2019s CityTime contract or its administrative agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects.\nIn connection with the resolution of certain investigations related to former Parent\u2019s CityTime contract, former Parent entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. The three-year term under former Parent\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement expired on March 14, 2015. Former Parent also entered into a five-year administrative agreement with the Army on behalf of the U.S. government in order to confirm former Parent\u2019s continuing eligibility to enter into and perform contracts with the U.S. government. We notified the U.S. Army that we will comply with the obligations set forth in the administrative agreement following the separation. These obligations include retaining an independent monitor and maintaining a similar contractor responsibility program, which will require significant resources and management involvement. In addition, given that we have retained the name Science Applications International Corporation, which was the name of the company that was the prime contractor under the CityTime contract, we may suffer reputational harm as a result of being associated with the contract as well as with former Parent\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement and administrative agreement and our compliance with obligations under the administrative agreement. This could make it more difficult to compete effectively and may adversely affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOur failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. Some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include:\n\u2022\nthe FAR and agency supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with certain contract awards;\n\u2022\nthe Procurement Integrity Act, which restricts access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information and limits our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials;\n\u2022\nthe Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial damages and civil penalties for submission of a false claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; and\n\u2022\nthe U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which impose requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts.\nThe FAR and many of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers. OCI arises when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the U.S. government, impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. Existing OCI, and any OCI that may develop, could preclude our competition for or performance on a significant project or contract, which could limit our opportunities.\nThe U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time.\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies and recovery of costs, among other items. U.S. government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential conflicts of interest, deterrence of fraud, and environmental responsibility or sustainability, as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of U.S. government agencies, such as increased usage of fixed price contracts, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are recompeted. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues, profitability and prospects.\nOur business is subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash position or growth prospects.\nU.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and others, routinely audit and review a contractor\u2019s performance on government contracts, indirect cost rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s compliance with government standards for its business systems, including a contractor\u2019s accounting system, earned value management system, estimating system, materials management system, property management system and purchasing system. A finding of significant control deficiencies in a contractor\u2019s business systems or a finding of noncompliance with CAS can result in decremented billing rates to U.S. government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and their remediation is accepted by the DCMA. Both contractors and the U.S. government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which the Company is held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nGovernment audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an \u201capproved\u201d determination of our various accounting and management internal control systems from the responsible U.S. government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. A determination of noncompliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including withholding of payments, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government.\nFormer Parent\u2019s indirect cost audits by the DCAA have not been completed for fiscal 2008 and subsequent fiscal years. Pursuant to a distribution agreement between former Parent and us, the impact of adjustments to approved indirect costs as a result of ongoing audits or reviews from fiscal 2006 through the Distribution Date will be shared between former Parent and us. For a more detailed discussion of the terms of the distribution agreement governing financial impacts as a result of audits and reviews of prior year indirect costs see Note 13 of the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements contained within this Annual Report.\nAlthough former Parent has recorded contract revenues after fiscal 2005 to the Distribution Date and we have recorded contract revenues after the Distribution Date based upon estimates of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review, we do not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and, if future adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our profitability, cash position and growth prospects.\nWe are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to our contracts and operations. If a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including the termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. We may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals. Penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry. If we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation, our profitability, cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nMisconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation.\nMisconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws, including the Anti-Kickback Act. Other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us, loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and, as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business and our future results.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nDue to the competitive process to obtain contracts and an increase in bid protests, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability.\nWe expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process, including IDIQ, GSA Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. For example, during fiscal 2013, we were not awarded the successor contract to the DISN Global Solutions (DGS) program with the Defense Information System Agency. In fiscal 2013, we recognized approximately $425 million in revenue on this program. Revenues from the DGS program were approximately $6 million during fiscal 2015 and $120 million during fiscal 2014 as the activity transitioned to the successor contractor.\nThe competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders. For contracts awarded to us, we also face the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win. Following contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay, contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding. Any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues and/or profitability. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. As a result, we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multi-award contracts. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe U.S. government may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and may suffer a decline in revenues and profitability.\nMany of the U.S. government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor may extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. These programs are normally funded on an annual basis. Under our contracts, the U.S. government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience. Any decision by the U.S. government not to exercise contract options or to terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues, revenue growth and profitability.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts. If a government customer terminates a contract for default, we may be exposed to liability, including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and solutions from another source. Depending on the nature and value of the contract, a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation.\nWe face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\nOur business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition, financial resources and larger technical staffs. We also compete with smaller, more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas. Additionally, we may compete with the U.S. government\u2019s own capabilities.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and solutions that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and solutions. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide, including technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel. In addition, our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers\u2019 needs. Accordingly, we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete for new contracts.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nA failure to attract, train, retain and utilize skilled employees, including our management team, would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations.\nOur business relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering, technical and professional personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees. In addition, many U.S. government programs require contractors to have security clearances. Depending on the level of required clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand. Particularly in highly specialized areas, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may affect our growth in the current and future fiscal years. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to attract, effectively train and retain these employees. Any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers\u2019 needs and win new business, which could adversely affect our future results.\nThe cost of providing our services, including the degree to which our employees are utilized, affects our profitability. The degree to which we are able to utilize our employees in a timely manner or at all is affected by a number of factors including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments, forecast demand for our services in order to maintain and deploy headcount that is aligned with demand, and our need to devote resources to training, business development, and other non-contract related activities. If our employees are under-utilized, our profitability could suffer. Additionally, if our employees are over-utilized, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and retention, which could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to attracting, retaining and effectively utilizing qualified engineering, technical and professional personnel, we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business. Our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry. Moreover, there is little redundancy or overlap of responsibilities in our corporate functions and loss of key personnel in critical functions could lead to lack of business continuity or disruptions in our operations, financial reporting or control processes until we are able to hire and train replacement personnel. Our inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities.\nWe recently entered into an agreement to make a significant acquisition and may make other acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures in the future that involve numerous risks, which if realized, may adversely affect our business and our future results.\nWe recently entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 1, 2015, under which we agreed to acquire Scitor Holdings, Inc. (Scitor) and its subsidiaries under certain conditions for a total purchase price of $790 million, subject to adjustment. Although completion of the Scitor acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, we expect to complete the acquisition of Scitor in May 2015. Our ability to complete the acquisition of Scitor is dependent upon certain financial institutions performing financing commitments entered into with us. We expect to incur approximately $670 million of additional debt secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets to fund a portion of the purchase price to acquire Scitor (New Credit Facility). In addition, we have amended the terms of our existing unsecured revolving and term loans (Existing Credit Facility) to, among other things, permit the New Credit Facility. Upon completion of the Scitor acquisition and closing of the New Credit Facility, it is expected that the Existing Credit Facility will also become secured by a lien on all of our assets. The New Credit Facility and the Existing Credit Facility are referred to below as the New and Existing Credit Facilities. In addition, under the terms of the New and Existing Credit Facilities, we will be required to maintain a certain ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (referred to as the Leverage Ratio). Further, under the terms of the New and Existing Credit Facilities, we will be limited in our ability to pay dividends beyond our current regular dividend and repurchase shares of our stock, be required to make certain mandatory prepayments based on the cash flow of our business, and be subject to other operational limitations.\nThe debt arrangements we expect to enter into with respect to our acquisition of Scitor will impose limitations on our ability to make other acquisitions. Subject to those limitations, in addition to Scitor, we may selectively pursue additional strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. The Scitor acquisition and other acquisitions, investments and joint ventures pose many risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results, including:\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\n\u00b7\nacquisitions normally require a significant investment of time and resources, which may disrupt our historic business and distract our management from other important responsibilities;\n\u00b7\neven if successful, the Scitor acquisition and any future acquisition could reduce our earnings per share or net income for a number of reasons, including the amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, the inability to generate or sustain profits of the acquired business, adverse changes in unhedged interest rates on debt incurred to complete the acquisition or a failure to realize assumed future tax benefits estimated in connection with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nwe may not retain key employees (including those with needed security clearances), customers and business partners of Scitor following our acquisition or those of an acquired business in the future;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to successfully integrate Scitor or other future acquired businesses, such as failing to successfully implement IT and other control systems relating to the operations of Scitor or any other future acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may not generate sufficient earnings to meet the required Leverage Ratio under the New and Existing Credit Facilities, which would give lenders the right to, among other things, foreclose on our assets;\n\u00b7\nthe limitations on our ability to issue dividends beyond our current regular dividend and to repurchase our stock under the New and Existing Credit Facilities may restrict our capital deployment decisions in the future, which may have an adverse impact on our stock price;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of the Scitor acquisition or any future acquisitions and investments on our business and we may not realize anticipated revenue opportunities, cost savings, or other synergies or benefits, or acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume known as well as unknown material liabilities that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume legal or regulatory risks, particularly with respect to businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs or that operate in markets in which we have previously had limited direct prior experience;\n\u00b7\nwe may be adversely impacted by developments in the U.S. government intelligence community budgets and other areas to which we had limited exposure prior to the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nwe may encounter performance problems with acquired technologies, capabilities and products, particularly with respect to those that are still in development when acquired;\n\u00b7\nacquired entities or joint ventures may not operate profitably, which could adversely affect our operating income or operating margins and we may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions, investments and joint ventures may require us to spend a significant amount of cash and incur a substantial amount of debt, with increased interest expense and amortization demands and mandatory prepayment requirements, or to issue capital stock, resulting in dilution of ownership; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to effectively influence the operations of our joint ventures or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations or fail to comply with legal requirements, laws and regulations.\nIf the Scitor acquisition or our future acquisitions, investments or joint ventures fail, perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason, including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may periodically divest businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nthe divested business, including through indemnification, guarantee or other financial arrangements, for a period of time following the transaction, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may not realize as revenues the entire amounts reflected in our backlog, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects.\nAs of January 30, 2015, our total backlog was $6.2 billion, which included $1.7 billion in funded backlog. Due to the U.S. government\u2019s ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate, modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our non-U.S. government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances, we may realize less than expected or, in some cases, never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains management\u2019s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues. If we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog, our expected future revenues, growth prospects and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources.\nWe generate revenues under various types of contracts, which include cost-reimbursement, T&M and FFP contracts. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or solutions provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts.\nOur profitability is adversely affected when we incur costs that we cannot bill to our customers. To varying degrees, each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Revenues derived from FFP contracts represented approximately 34% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015. When making proposals on these types of contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. In each case, our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during the performance of our work could result, and in some instances has resulted, in reduced profits or in losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of our contracts, including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors, natural disasters or other force majeure events, could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable.\nWe use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of revenues from our contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. This method requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process, particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the long-term nature of certain contracts, is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized immediately. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect future financial results.\nOur business and financial results could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats.\nAs a U.S. government contractor and a provider of IT services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies, we handle sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, protected health information, personnel information, classified information, financial information and other confidential information concerning our business and employees and those of our customers (collectively referred to below as sensitive information). We are continuously exposed to cyber and other security threats, including computer viruses, attacks by hackers or physical break-ins. Any electronic or physical break-in or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of sensitive or other information stored or transmitted through our IT systems and networks. This could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, attempts by others to\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\ngain unauthorized access to our IT systems are becoming more sophisticated. These attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others, and may be perpetrated by well-funded organized crime or state sponsored efforts. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. We continue to improve our threat protection, detection and mitigation policies, procedures and controls. In addition, we work with other companies in the industry and government participants to promote increased awareness and enhanced protections against cybersecurity threats. However, because of the evolving nature of these security threats, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such incident. We may experience similar security threats to the IT systems that we develop, install or maintain under customer contracts, including customer contracts under which we may have access to or management responsibility for customer databases or networks that contain sensitive information relating to our customers, their employees or related third parties. Although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber and other security threats, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities. In the event of unauthorized access to sensitive information that we are responsible for safeguarding, our customers and their employees or related third parties, if applicable, may seek to hold us liable for any costs or other damages associated with the unauthorized access as a breach of our contractual and other obligations. In addition, various federal or state agencies may bring legal action against us for violation of or noncompliance with regulatory requirements relating to any unauthorized access to sensitive information within our control. Any remediation costs, damages or other liabilities related to unauthorized access of sensitive information of ours or our customers caused by cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any unauthorized access caused by these security threats could adversely affect our reputation, ability to work on sensitive U.S. government contracts, business operations and financial results.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and solutions to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAny internal disruption or failure in our IT network, software or hardware systems or communications, utilities or other business equipment or services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide the services required to be performed by us under customer contracts or bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. We are also vulnerable to failures in these systems, equipment and other business services caused by third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption. As a result, any internal or external disruption or failure in our IT network, software or hardware systems or communications, utilities or other business equipment or services could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nCustomer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nMany of the systems and networks that we develop, install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions, if a system or network that we develop, install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats or other events, we may experience loss of revenue, remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination. Any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nLegal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report. We are also subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. The Department of Justice and other enforcement agencies of the U.S. government may bring claims or lawsuits against us in connection with our performance of government contracts or our\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nbilling or record-keeping relating to those contracts. The Department of Justice has considerably more resources at its disposal than we do, and can bring suspension and debarment proceedings against us that would prevent us from working for some or all U.S. government customers. In addition, certain statutes under which the Department of Justice may bring claims, like the False Claims Act, provide for treble damages and penalties on a per invoice basis against government contractors. These circumstances generally give the Department of Justice significantly more leverage in any legal dispute with us than if we were defending ourselves against claims brought by a commercial enterprise. Adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation could be costly to defend, and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Litigation and other claims, including those described under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report, are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\nOur business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nGoodwill represents a significant amount of our total assets and any impairment of these assets would negatively impact our results of operations.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of. In addition, we recently entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 1, 2015, under which we agreed to acquire Scitor Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries under certain conditions for a total purchase price of $790 million, subject to adjustment. We expect goodwill and the value of our intangible assets to increase significantly following completion of this acquisition. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results.\nWe depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services, products and solutions provided by us and the other companies will help us to win and perform the contract. We expect to continue our use of teaming relationships. Our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us, or if the U.S. government terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. Companies that do not have access to U.S. government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies\u2019 prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to win these contracts.\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. Current uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nsubcontractors, which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders, especially if the customer is an agency of the U.S. government.\nOur spin-off transaction subjects us to risks relating to the protest of contracts and contract vehicles bid for us by our former Parent before completion of the spin-off transaction and by us before novation of those contracts and contract vehicles to us from former Parent.\nIn September 2013, we completed a spin-off transaction from former Parent and became an independent, publicly traded company. In July 2014, the government signed a novation agreement authorizing the novation from former Parent to us of customer contracts and contract vehicles that relate primarily to our business. We are in the process of completing the administrative tasks relating to completion of the novation process of those contracts and contract vehicles. While we do not expect the completion of the novation process to delay payments to us in any material respect on contracts novated to us by our former Parent, we have experienced the protest by competitors of new awards of contracts to us on grounds relating to the spin-off transaction.\nCertain contracts were bid for by our former Parent before completion of the spin-off transaction with the expressed intention that they be novated to us after award. Some of these proposals for contracts are still pending award by the government. Contract awards to our former Parent resulting from these proposals may be challenged by unsuccessful competitors who file a timely protest after such award. In addition, competitors have protested the award of bids to us that were submitted by us after completion of the spin-off but before the government approved the novation of the applicable contract vehicles to us from former Parent. These competitors have based their protests on grounds, among others, that we were not a qualified bidder since (i) the contract vehicle was not in our Company\u2019s name at the time the bid was submitted and (ii) we should not be able to include the past performance of our business while we were owned by our former Parent. If competitors are successful in protesting the award of bids to us or our former Parent on these grounds or other spin-off related reasons, our revenue and results from operations would be negatively affected.\nWe do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical pre-separation financial information we have included in this Annual Report has been derived from former Parent\u2019s financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Former Parent did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone entity for the applicable periods even if we represented an important business in former Parent\u2019s historical financial statements. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future. For example, following the separation in September 2013, changes have been made to our cost structure, funding and operations, including changes for income taxes, increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with becoming a public, stand-alone company. While we generated net profits as part of former Parent, we cannot provide assurance that our profits will continue at a similar level or at all as a stand-alone company.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expected to achieve following the separation; our recent change to a matrix organizational structure or future changes in organizational structure, capabilities or strategy to respond to developments in our markets may not be successful.\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we expect that our business would benefit from, among other things, the removal of certain OCI in the pursuit of business opportunities, the alignment of our cost structure with our new business objectives and improved management incentive tools. However, by separating from former Parent, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of former Parent. In addition, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expected to achieve as an independent company, including additional revenues as a result of removing certain OCI as a result of the separation, in the time we expect, if at all. Further, in anticipation of the spin-off, we implemented a matrix organizational structure to better enable customer focus and more efficient use of resources while maintaining performance excellence. We may in the future make further changes to our organizational structure, change our mix of capabilities or modify our strategy to respond to developments in our markets and grow our business. The implementation of the matrix organizational structure\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nor any future changes to our organizational structure, capabilities or strategy may not be successful or yield the anticipated benefits and they may ultimately have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers, prospective customers and suppliers may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers and suppliers may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. If our customers, prospective customers or suppliers are not satisfied with our financial stability, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to bid for and obtain or retain customer contracts, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were part of former Parent.\nAs part of former Parent, we could take advantage of former Parent\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits, and technology such as computer software licenses. In addition, we relied on former Parent to provide various corporate functions. After the spin-off, as a separate, independent entity, we may be unable to obtain these goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the separation. We may also incur costs for functions previously performed by former Parent that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, which could cause our profitability to decrease.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. We may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with the performance of services, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under government-funded contracts and subcontracts, which may permit the U.S. government to disclose or license this information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and solutions we provide. The expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur insurance may be insufficient to protect us from claims or losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage with third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. However, not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance, and, for those risks we insure, the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations could be disrupted. Our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant warranty and other liability claims or losses. Moreover, there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage, our business and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of our insurance coverage, any significant claim could have an adverse impact on our market reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nBusiness disruptions caused by natural disasters and other crises could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe have significant operations located in regions of the United States that may be exposed to damaging storms and other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, flooding, wildfires or earthquakes. Our business could also be disrupted by pandemics and other national or international crises. Although preventative measures may help mitigate the damage from such occurrences, the damage and disruption to our business resulting from any of these events may be significant. If our insurance and other risk mitigation mechanisms are not sufficient to recover all costs, including loss of revenues from sales to customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Performance failures and disruptions by our subcontractors due to these types of events may also adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on a prime contract, which could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or the customer and could result in a termination of our contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.\nWe could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our detection systems fail to operate as intended or our assessment reports prove to be inaccurate.\nWe have developed and sold tsunami buoys and related services that are designed to assist in the detection of tsunamis or large waves that may have catastrophic consequences to coastal communities. Our buoys have been deployed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and non-U.S. governments in other areas around the world. There are many factors, some of which are beyond our control, which could result in the failure of these buoys. We may develop other products or provide services for the detection of natural or manmade threats that could have catastrophic consequences if the threats are realized. In addition, we prepare reports for various government customers in the evaluation or assessment of the consequences of certain threats or natural disasters. The failure of our products and services to help detect the threats for which they were designed or the failure of our reports to accurately assess the consequences of certain threats could contribute to injury, death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability, professional liability, or other claims against us. Further, if our products, services or reports fail to, or are perceived to have failed to help detect or adequately assess a threat, the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur services and operations sometimes involve using, handling or disposing of hazardous substances or dangerous materials, which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nSome of our services and operations involve the use, handling or disposal of hazardous substances or dangerous materials, including explosive, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials. These activities generally subject us to extensive foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, which, among other things, require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances or dangerous materials. Furthermore, failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanctions, including fines, penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government or could cause us to incur costs to change, upgrade, remediate and/or close some of our operations or properties. Although we do not have extensive real estate holdings, our ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws, some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to, these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nOur international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our U.S. business. Failure to comply with U.S. government laws and regulations applicable to international business such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. government and could expose us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, these risks relating to international operations may expose us to potentially significant contract losses.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nIn some countries, there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services, sale of our solutions or repatriation of our profits. International transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability, imposition of tariffs or additional taxes, restrictive trade policies and differing legal systems. We provide services and solutions in support of U.S. government customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable, which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life, or damage or destruction of property, or inability to meet our contractual obligations. Although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues, we do not know the impact that these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors may have on our business in the future and any of these factors could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to our Stock\nProvisions in our organizational documents, the Tax Matters Agreement and Delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. These restrictions, which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management, include the following:\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation provides that its bylaws and certain provisions of its certificate of incorporation may be amended by only two-thirds or more voting power of all of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. These supermajority voting requirements could impede our stockholders\u2019 ability to make changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation contains certain supermajority voting provisions, which generally provide that mergers and certain other business combinations between a related person and us be approved by the holders of securities having at least 80% of our outstanding voting power, as well as by the holders of a majority of the voting power of such securities that are not owned by the related person.\n\u2022\nour stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our stock are limited in their ability to take certain actions other than in connection with the annual stockholders\u2019 meeting or a special meeting called at the request of qualified stockholders as provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\n\u2022\nour Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years, or among other things, our Board of Directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15% holder prior to the time the person became a 15% holder.\nIn addition, under the Tax Matters Agreement with former Parent, we agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition (including issuance) of our common stock or any other transaction (or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction) that could cause the distribution to be taxable to former Parent. We also agreed to indemnify former Parent for any tax resulting from any such transactions. Generally, former Parent will recognize taxable gain on the distribution if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our capital stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding capital stock, and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nWe have contracts with the U.S. government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. government that are subject to security restrictions (classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other programs and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our stock in the future.\nThe Board of Directors authorized and declared a quarterly cash dividend for each of the quarters since the separation from former Parent. The declaration of any future dividends and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates and payment dates for any future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors taking into account future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will declare any dividends in the future. In addition, our ability to declare and pay any future dividends may be restricted by the provisions of Delaware law and covenants in the New and Existing Credit Facilities. To the extent that expectations by market participants regarding the potential payment, or amount, of any dividend prove to be incorrect, the price of our common stock may be materially and negatively affected and investors that bought shares of our common stock based on those expectations may suffer a loss on their investment.\nForward-Looking Statement Risks\nYou may not be able to rely on forward-looking statements.\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management\u2019s belief and assumptions about the future in light of information currently available to our management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d and similar words or phrases or the negative of these words or phrases. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results anticipated by our forward-looking statements, which include, but are not limited to the risk factors discussed above.\nWe do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements or to conform these statements to actual results.", "PERMNO": 14141, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "SAIC"}
