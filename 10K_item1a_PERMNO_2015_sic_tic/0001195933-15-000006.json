The risks below should be read and considered with other information provided in this report and in other reports and materials we have filed with the SEC. In addition to these risks, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to price accurately the risks we underwrite, profitability may be affected.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to set premium rates accurately. Inflationary pressures on medical care, auto parts and repair services costs complicate pricing with accuracy. Accurate pricing is also dependent on the availability of sufficient, reliable data on which to project both severity and frequency trends and timely recognition of changes in loss cost trends. This process poses more of a challenge in markets where we have less pricing experience. We could under-price risks, which could negatively affect our profit margins, or overprice risks, which could reduce sales volume and competitiveness. Either scenario could adversely affect profitability.\nBecause of the significant concentration of our business in California and Florida, negative developments in the regulatory, legal or economic conditions in these states may adversely affect our profitability.\nCalifornia and Florida personal auto business represented 79% of our total gross written premium in 2014. In 2014 our two largest urban zones, one in California and one in Florida, represented 52% of total gross written premium and approximately 88% of total underwriting profits. As we cease writing new business in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania in 2015, our personal auto business may become further concentrated in these states and within our two largest urban zones. Consequently, the dynamic nature of regulatory, legal, competitive and economic conditions in these states affects our revenues and profitability. Further, both California and Florida have regulations that limit the after-tax return on underwriting profit allowed for an insurer. These conditions could negatively affect premium revenue and make it more expensive or less profitable for us to conduct business in these states.\nWe rely upon a limited number of independent agents to generate a substantial portion of our business. If we were unable to retain or increase the level of business that these independent agents place with us or increase the level of business generated by other agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nApproximately 15% of our 11,800 independent agencies and brokers accounted for approximately 80% of our gross written premium in 2014. Further, in California, our most profitable state, 52 agencies and brokers produced 50% of our premium in the state, which is 25% of our premium nationwide. Some of our current agencies may merge or be acquired and the surviving entity may reduce the number of insurers with which business is placed. We must compete with other insurance carriers for the business of these agents in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Some competitors offer more advanced systems to quote and process business, a larger variety of products, lower prices for insurance coverage, higher commissions or more attractive cash and non-cash incentives.\nIf we fail to establish accurate loss reserves, our financial position and results of operations may be affected.\nOur loss reserves are our best estimate of the amounts that will be paid for losses incurred as well as losses incurred but not reported. The accuracy of these estimates depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the availability of sufficient and reliable historical data, inflationary pressures on medical and auto repair costs, changes in regulation, changes in frequency and severity trends and changes in our claims settlement practices. Because of the inherent uncertainty involved in the practice of establishing loss reserves, ultimate losses paid could vary materially from recorded reserves and may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are vulnerable to a reduction in business written through the independent agent distribution channel.\nReliance on the independent agency as our primary distribution channel makes us vulnerable to the growing popularity of direct to consumer distribution channels, particularly the Internet. Approximately 73% of all personal automobile insurance sold in the United States is sold direct or through captive agents (agents employed by one company or selling only one company's products) and approximately 27% is sold by independent agents. A material reduction in business generated through the independent agency channel could negatively affect our revenues and growth opportunities.\nJudicial, regulatory and legislative changes or challenges to prevailing insurance industry practices are ongoing, some of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nPolitical, judicial, economic and financial developments occasionally lead to challenges or changes to established industry practices. Recent examples include challenges to (i) the use of credit and other rating factors in making risk selection and pricing decisions; and (ii) the use of automated databases in the adjustment of claims. Some result in class action litigation, regulatory sanctions and substantial fines or penalties. It is difficult to predict the outcome or impact of current challenges or to identify others that might be brought in the future.\nThe failure to maintain or to develop further reliable, efficient and secure information technology systems would be disruptive to our operations and diminish our ability to compete successfully.\nWe are highly dependent on efficient and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and business systems. These systems quote, process and service our business, and perform actuarial functions necessary for pricing and product development. These systems must also be able to undergo periodic modifications and improvements without interruptions or untimely delays in service. This capability is crucial to meeting growing customer demands for user friendly, online capabilities and convenient, quality service. We are undergoing fundamental changes and improvements to our policy services platform. A failure or delay to achieve these improvements could interrupt certain processes or degrade business operations and could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, failure to maintain secure systems could result in unauthorized access to or theft of sensitive customer data.\nThe inability to recruit, develop and retain key personnel could prevent us from executing our key business and financial objectives.\nSuccessful execution of our key business and financial objectives will depend, in part, upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer, James Gober, along with our ability to retain and develop key personnel and to attract new talent. The highly competitive nature of the industry, along with the advantages that larger, better-known firms possess in the recruiting process, poses a challenge. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder us in meeting or exceeding our business and financial objectives.\nExtra-contractual losses arising from bad faith claims could materially reduce our profitability.\nIn California and Florida, the judicial climate, case law or statutory framework are often viewed as unfavorable toward an insurer in litigation brought against it by policyholders and third-party claimants. This tends to increase our exposure to extra-contractual losses, or monetary damages beyond policy limit, in what are known as \u201cbad faith\u201d claims, for which reinsurance may be unavailable. Such claims have in the past, and may in the future, result in losses to us that materially reduce our profitability.\nOur goodwill may be at risk for impairment if actual results regarding growth and profitability vary from our estimates.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $75.3 million, or approximately $6.56 per share, of goodwill. In accordance with the Goodwill topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we perform impairment test procedures for goodwill on an annual basis. These procedures require us to calculate the fair value of goodwill, compare the result to our carrying value and record the amount of any shortfall as an impairment charge.\nWe use a variety of methods to test goodwill for impairment, including estimates of future discounted cash flows and comparisons of our market value to our major competitors. Our cash flow projections rely on assumptions that are subject to uncertainty, including premium growth, loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, interest rates and capital requirements. If actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, the fair value of our goodwill could fall below our carrying value and we could be required to record an impairment charge.\nINFINITY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CORPORATION 10-K", "PERMNO": 89681, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "IPCC"}
