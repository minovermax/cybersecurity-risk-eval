RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Before investing in our securities you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the financial and other information contained in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and investors may lose all or a part of their investment.\nThis report contains certain statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of our Company. Readers are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating such statements, readers should specifically consider the various factors identified in this report, including the matters set forth below, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.\nThe risks described below do not purport to be all the risks to which the Company could be exposed. This section is a summary of certain risks and is not set out in any particular order of priority. They are the risks that we presently believe are material to the operations of the Company. Additional risks of which we are not presently aware or which we presently deem immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects.\nAlthough we were incorporated in 2005, we did not sell our first Ekso medical device until 2012. Therefore, we have limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our business plan or performance and prospects can be made. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications encountered in connection with a newly established business and creating a new industry. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products and services, or that although functional and scalable, our products and services will not be economical to market; that our competitors hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing such products; that our competitors market a superior or equivalent product; that we are not able to upgrade and enhance our technologies and products to accommodate new features and expanded service offerings; or that we fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances for our products. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that we can successfully address these challenges. If we are unsuccessful, we and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nGiven the limited operating history, management has little basis on which to forecast future demand for our products from our existing customer base, much less new customers. Our current and future expense levels are based largely on estimates of planned operations and future revenues rather than experience. It is difficult to accurately forecast future revenues because our business is new and our market has not been developed. If our forecasts prove incorrect, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated reduction in revenue. As a result, any significant reduction in revenues would immediately and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use, or are otherwise more attractive, we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies.\nThe medical technology and industrial robotics industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change, and we will face competition on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Competitors may include large medical device and other companies, some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets. Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do or may be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nOur competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. Competitors may offer, or may attempt to develop, more efficacious, safer, cheaper, or more convenient alternatives to our products, including alternatives that could make the need for robotic exoskeletons obsolete. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. The entry into the market of manufacturers located in low-cost manufacturing locations may also create pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets. Our future success depends, among other things, upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances, and upon our ability to successfully implement our marketing strategies and execute our research and development plan.\nOur products or exoskeletons generally may not be accepted in the market.\nWe cannot be certain that our current products or any other products we may develop or market will achieve or maintain market acceptance. Market acceptance of our products depends on many factors, including our ability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding our products, convince distributors and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies, convince health insurers and other third party payers to cover and provide adequate payments for any products that are used for medical or therapy purposes, demonstrate that our products are reliable and supported by us in the field, supply and service sufficient quantities of products directly or through marketing alliances, and price products competitively in light of the current macroeconomic environment, which, particularly in the case of the medical device industry, is becoming increasingly price sensitive.\nIn addition, the market for medical and industrial exoskeletons is new and unproven. We cannot be certain that the market for robotic exoskeletons will continue to develop, or that robotic exoskeletons for medical or industrial use will achieve market acceptance. If the exoskeleton market fails to develop, or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nDependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to attain, defend or maintain such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may result in our payment of significant monetary damages or adversely impact our product offerings.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. Failure to protect or to obtain, maintain or extend adequate patent and other intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our competitive advantage and impair our business. Our issued patents may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property and our patent applications may not result in issued patents. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner or may challenge the validity of our patents. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights ultimately may be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain any of our patents that issue.\nFurthermore, we have not filed applications for all of our patents internationally and may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our products in other countries. These include, in some cases, countries in which we are currently selling products and countries in which we intend to sell products in the future.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products.\nThe industries in which we operate, including, in particular, the medical device industry, are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we might be the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of our management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of the patents in the intellectual property portfolio are not within our complete control, which could reduce the value of such patents.\nSome of our U.S. patent applications (which have associated international applications) are co-owned by the Regents of the University of California Berkeley. The Regents of the University of California Berkeley has licensed its rights under many of these patent applications to us, but we do not have a license to their rights under three of these patent applications. With respect to two of these co-owned patent applications, the Regents of the University of California Berkeley have licensed their rights in the U.S. to an unrelated third party. The third patent application will need to be fully prosecuted before it can be determined which claims are exclusive to us (through a previous license) and which claims the Regents of the University of California Berkeley may license to other entities. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from Equipois, we assumed the rights and obligations of Equipois with respect to certain patents and patent applications under an in-license of intellectual property from a third party and subject to an out-license of that intellectual property to an unrelated third party for use in a particular field. We do not have complete control over the prosecution of these patent applications. In addition, the license of patent rights under these patents to third parties could reduce the value of our patent portfolio and limit any income or license fees that we might receive if we were to attempt to transfer or license our rights under any of our co-owned or licensed patents.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our medical device products, or if clearances or approvals for future products or modifications to existing products are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nThe Ekso GT is a medical device that is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the European Union and other governmental authorities both inside and outside of the United States. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of our medical products. Our failure to comply with these complex laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process may take anywhere from several months to over a year. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials.\nThe FDA also has substantial discretion in the medical device review process. Despite the time, effort and cost, we cannot assure you that any particular device will be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business. Failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional development, standardized testing, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm or business.\nThe FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a medical device candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be substantially equivalent to a device lawfully marketed either as a grandfathered device or one that was cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process;\n\u00b7 a medical device candidate may not be deemed to be in conformance with applicable standards and regulations;\n\u00b7 FDA or other regulatory officials may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials or other product testing date to be sufficient;\n\u00b7 other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve our processes or facilities or those of any of our third-party manufacturers, thereby restricting export; or\n\u00b7 the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may change clearance or approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nEven after regulatory clearance or approval has been granted, a cleared or approved product and its manufacturer are subject to extensive regulatory requirements relating to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7 restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 adverse inspectional observations (Form 483), warning letters, non-warning letters incorporating inspectional observations;\n\u00b7 civil or criminal penalties or fines;\n\u00b7 injunctions;\n\u00b7 product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7 total or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7 imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u00b7 refusal to clear or approve pending applications or premarket notifications; and\n\u00b7 import and export restrictions.\nIf imposed on us, any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nModifications to our Ekso GT and our future products may require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained\nOn April 4, 2016, the Company received clearance from the FDA to market its Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton for use in the treatment of individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke, individuals with spinal cord injuries at levels T4 to L5, and individuals with spinal cord injuries at levels of T3 to C7 (ASIA D), in accordance with the device\u2019s labeling. On July 19, 2016, the Company received clearance from the FDA to expand/clarify the indications and labeling to expressly include individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke who have upper extremity function of at least 4/5 in only one arm. The Company\u2019s prior cleared indications for use statement required that individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke have upper extremity function of at least 4/5 in both arms.\nAn element of our strategy is to continue to upgrade the Ekso GT to incorporate new software and hardware enhancements. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device, including our Ekso GT, that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design, or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review such determinations. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations for any future changes, or prior changes to previously marketed products, as the case may be, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified products until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s ongoing review of its 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In July and December 2011, respectively, the FDA issued draft guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) due to modifications to 510(k) cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The July 2011 draft guidance document was ultimately withdrawn, and as a result, the FDA\u2019s original guidance document regarding 510(k) modifications, which dates back to 1997, remains in place. It is uncertain when the FDA will seek to issue new guidance on product modifications. Any efforts to do so could result in a more rigorous review process and make it more difficult to obtain clearance for device modifications.\nThe manufacture of our products is subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA. Our failure to meet strict regulatory requirements could require us to pay fines, incur other costs or even close our facilities.\nWe are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, handling, storage, distribution, installation, servicing and shipping of our marketed products. These regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production costs and may even prevent us from making our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand. If we change our approved manufacturing process, the FDA may need to review the process before it may be used. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nFederal, state and non-U.S. regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes. The complexity, timeframes and costs associated with obtaining marketing clearances are unknown. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, these changes might have on our business, the impact could be material.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \"off-label\" uses.\nAny cleared or approved product may be promoted only for its indicated uses and our promotional materials must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations. We believe that the specific use for which our products are marketed fall within the scope of the indications for use that have been cleared by the FDA. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired.\nFailure to comply with anti-kickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could significantly impact our business. The principal U.S. federal laws implicated include those that prohibit (i) the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment, known as the false claims laws, (ii) unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded health care programs, known as the anti-kickback laws, and (iii) health care service providers from seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider, known as the Stark law. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nU.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated devices. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify cleared products on a timely basis.\nAny change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market, and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval, for any new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nIf our medical products, or malfunction of our medical products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. For example, we have been informed of a limited number of events with respect to our Ekso GT devices that have been determined to be reportable pursuant to the MDR regulations. There were no reported patient injuries related to any of these events, and in each case we have filed the required MDR reports with the FDA.\nIn addition, all manufacturers bringing medical devices to market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any incident that led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, and which the manufacturer\u2019s device is suspected to have caused, to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In such case, the manufacturer must file an initial report with the relevant competent authority, which would be followed by further evaluation or investigation of the incident and a final report indicating whether further action is required. The events described above that were reported to the FDA were also reported to the relevant EU regulatory authorities.\nWe are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all Company-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Recalls of our products, or agency actions relating to our failure to comply with our reporting or recordkeeping obligations, could harm our reputation and financial results.\nDiscovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. In addition, manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. To date, we have initiated only one field action in which we voluntarily accelerated our maintenance schedule based on field usage.\nWhen a medical human exoskeleton is used by a paralyzed individual to walk, the individual relies completely on the exoskeleton to hold them upright. There are many exoskeleton components that, if they were to fail catastrophically, could cause a fall resulting in severe injury or death of the patient. Certain of our competitors have reported injuries caused by the malfunction of human exoskeleton devices (in at least one case to the FDA). Injuries caused by the malfunction or misuse of human exoskeleton devices, even where such malfunction or misuse occurs with respect to one of our competitor\u2019s products, could cause regulatory agencies to implement more conservative regulations on the medical human exoskeleton industry, which could significantly increase our operating costs.\nSimilarly, when an industrial exoskeleton is used by a healthy individual - for example to operate heavy machinery overhead - malfunction of the device at an inopportune moment could result in severe injury or death of the person using the device. Such occurrences could result in regulatory action on the part of OSHA or its foreign counterparts.\nAny future recalls of any of our products could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nIn addition, personal injuries relating to the use of our products could also result in product liability claims being brought against us. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in substantial damages, be costly and time-consuming to defend and could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nWe could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of medical devices entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage is subject to deductibles and limitations, and may not be adequate to cover future claims. A successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent the successful commercialization of our products, cause a significant financial burden on us, or both, which in either case could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWarranty claims or any other service and repairs provided by the Company at its expense could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales of our Ekso GT generally include a one-year warranty for parts and services in the U.S. and a two-year warranty in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We also generally provide customers with an option to purchase an extended warranty for up to an additional three years. The costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty-related legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. As we enhance our product and in an effort to build our brand and drive adoption, the Company has elected to incur increased service expenses related to an accelerated maintenance program, field corrections and the implementation of technological improvements developed subsequent to many of our units being placed into service, sometimes outside of its warranty and contractual obligations. Continuation of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIf we are not able to both obtain and maintain adequate levels of third-party reimbursement for our products, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealthcare providers and related facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through payment systems managed by various governmental agencies worldwide, private insurance companies, and managed care organizations. The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care, the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) utilized, available budget, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer\u2019s discretion. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rates of new technologies.\nWe have no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our medical device products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d programs implemented by various public and private payers, and expansion of payment bundling schemes such as Accountable Care Organizations, and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers) that may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for our current products or products we develop.\nLegislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad, or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers may be willing to pay for such products and could result in decrease revenue.\nAny additional studies that we are required or choose to initiate, whether to drive market adoption and support commercialization, or to support additional product submissions or new claims, will be expensive and time consuming, which could harm our financial results.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to drive market adoption and support commercialization, or to support additional product submissions or new claims, can be time consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials. Conducting successful clinical studies requires the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators and support staff, proximity of patients to clinical sites, patient ability to meet the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance.\nAll clinical trial activities that we undertake are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. Clinical trials intended to support a 510(k) or PMA must be conducted in compliance with the FDA\u2019s Good Clinical Practice regulations and similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions. Sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy may be required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support future clearances and approvals. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in future clearances or approvals of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support new product submissions or claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nDespite considerable time and expense invested in clinical trials, the FDA may not consider any data that we obtain adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy for future submissions. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our intended claims or demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials or studies could delay the filing of associated product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize products requiring submission of clinical data or relying on clinical data for market acceptance.\nIt is also possible that patients enrolled in a clinical trial will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s safety profile, which could cause us to delay or abandon development of such product.\nClinical studies regarding our products may not provide sufficient data to either cause third-party payers to approve reimbursement or to make human exoskeletons a standard of care.\nOur business plan relies on broad adoption of human exoskeletons to provide neuro-rehabilitation in the form of gait training to individuals who have suffered a neurological injury or disorder. Although use of human exoskeletons in neuro-rehabilitation is new, use of robotic devices to provide gait training has been going on for over a decade and the clinical studies relating to such devices have had both positive and negative outcomes. Much of the rehabilitation community has rejected the use of such devices based on the data from some of these studies. Although we believe that human exoskeletons will outperform such robotic equipment, this has not been proven. Furthermore, it may prove impossible to prove an advantage in a timely manner, or at all, which could prevent broad adoption of our products.\nPart of our business plan relies on broad adoption of the Ekso robotic exoskeleton to provide \u201cearly mobilization\u201d of individuals who have been immobilized by an injury, disease, or other condition. Although the health benefits of other methods of \u201cearly mobilization\u201d have been demonstrated in clinical studies in fields such as stroke, those studies did not test early mobilization with human exoskeletons directly. To date, the Ekso device has been the subject of several clinical trials, some of which have been partially sponsored by us, but most of which are non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions. Data from these studies was provided to the FDA as part of our 510(k) submissions. In addition, there are several ongoing independent studies to investigate additional indications for use for the Ekso device, as well as to evaluate clinical and non-clinical outcomes of using the Ekso device, and we are currently in the planning stage for several Company-led studies.\nIf current and future clinical trials do not provide sufficient data to support our belief that early mobilization through the use of exoskeletons improves health outcomes, of such studies actually contradict that belief, market acceptance of the human exoskeletons could fail to increase or could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. In addition, as we introduce new products or services, we will need to hire additional personnel. Currently, competition for personnel with the required knowledge, skill and experiences is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, where we are headquartered, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will experience long and variable sales cycles, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter and may result in volatility in our stock price.\nThe Ekso GT has a lengthy sale and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions, which may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Other factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 general economic uncertainties and political concerns;\n\u00b7 the introduction of new products or product lines;\n\u00b7 product modifications;\n\u00b7 the level of market acceptance of new products;\n\u00b7 the timing and amount of research and development and other expenditures;\n\u00b7 timing of the receipt of orders from, and product shipments to, distributors and customers;\n\u00b7 changes in the distribution arrangements for our products;\n\u00b7 manufacturing or supply delays;\n\u00b7 the time needed to educate and train additional sales and manufacturing personnel; and\n\u00b7 costs associated with defending our intellectual property.\nIn addition to these factors, expenditures are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nInternational sales of our products account for a portion of our revenues, which will expose us to certain operating risks. If we are unable to successfully manage our international activities, our net sales, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur business currently depends in part on our activities in Europe and other foreign markets, making it subject to a number of challenges that specifically relate to international business activities. These include:\n\u00b7 failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets;\n\u00b7 the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets;\n\u00b7 building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations;\n\u00b7 challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u00b7 challenges caused by differences in legal regulations, markets, and customer preferences, which may limit our ability to adapt our products or succeed in other regions;\n\u00b7 multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, foreign laws, tax schemes, international import and export legislation, trading and investment policies, exchange controls and tariff and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7 foreign tax consequences;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates and foreign currency translation adjustments;\n\u00b7 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned outside the United States;\n\u00b7 imposition of public sector controls;\n\u00b7 political, economic and social instability; and\n\u00b7 restrictions on the export or import of technology.\nIf we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges, then our international operations may not be successful, which could adversely affect our net sales, results of operations and financial condition and limit our growth.\nThe disruption or loss of relationships with vendors and suppliers for the components of our products could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to manufacture and market our products successfully is dependent on relationships with both third party vendors and suppliers. Although most of the raw materials that we use to manufacture our products are readily available from a number of suppliers, we generally procure raw materials and components through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of various components, if and as required in the future, may subject us to:\n\u00b7 delays in delivery or shortages in components that could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellations of orders for our products;\n\u00b7 increased component prices and supply delays as we establish alternative suppliers;\n\u00b7 inability to develop alternative sources for product components;\n\u00b7 required modifications of our products, which may cause delays in product shipments, increased manufacturing costs, and increased product prices; and\n\u00b7 increased inventory costs as we hold more inventory than we otherwise might in order to avoid problems from shortages or discontinuance, which may result in write-offs if we are unable to use all such products in the future.\nIn addition, failure of any one supplier\u2019s components could result in a product recall, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth and entry into new business areas.\nIf the initial response to our exoskeleton products exceeds our capacity to provide services timely and efficiently, then we may need to expand our operations accordingly and swiftly. Our management believes that establishing industry leadership will require us to:\n\u00b7 test, introduce and develop new products and services including enhancements to our Ekso device;\n\u00b7 develop and expand the breadth of products and services offered;\n\u00b7 develop and expand our market presence through relationships with third parties; and\n\u00b7 generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded products or services to fund the foregoing requirements while obtaining and maintaining satisfactory profit margins.\nTo be able to expand our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner and increase the overall market acceptance of our products and services in this manner, we will need additional capital and technical and managerial human resources. These additional resources may not be available to us. Our failure to timely and efficiently expand our operations and successfully achieve the four requirements listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew product introductions may adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may introduce new products with enhanced features and extended capabilities from time to time. The products may be subject to various regulatory processes, and we may need to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in order to sell our new products. If a potential purchaser believes that we plan to introduce a new product in the near future or if a potential purchaser is located in a country where a new product that we have introduced has not yet received regulatory approval, planned purchases may be deferred or delayed. As a result, new product introductions may adversely impact our financial results.\nThe acquisition of other companies, businesses, or technologies could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions, any of which could be material to our business, operating results, and financial condition. Future acquisitions could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business. In addition, integrating an acquired company, business or technology is risky and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and integrating each company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management. The anticipated benefits of future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nHealthcare changes in the U.S. and other countries, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, could have a negative impact on our future operating results.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) was enacted into law. The legislation seeks to reform the United States healthcare system. It is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over time. We expect the new law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations. The ACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures. These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also possible that the ACA will result in lower reimbursements. While the ACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of our products remains uncertain. In addition, the new law imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices that will apply to United States sales of our medical device product. The new U.S. Presidential administration and the majority party in both Houses of the U.S. Congress have indicated their desire to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear whether, when and how that repeal will be effectuated and what the effect on the healthcare sector will be. The outlook for the healthcare sector is unclear, and we are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations. Changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the ACA, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where we will do business. Pricing pressure has also increased in these markets due to continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally. Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect our future operating results.\nNatural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, military conflict and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters are located in California, a seismically active region. A natural disaster in any of our major markets in North America or Europe could have a material adverse impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. Further, any unanticipated business disruption caused by Internet security threats, damage to global communication networks or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2005. Our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding the same in its report to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may create negative reactions to the price of our common stock and we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing in the future.\nOur net losses were $23.5 million, $19.6 million, and $33.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $114.9 million.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business, acquire customers and develop our platform and new functionality. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses.\nWe may not be able to reduce the cost to manufacture or service our products as planned.\nOur business plan assumes that exoskeletons can be manufactured more inexpensively than they are currently being manufactured. However, we have not yet found a way to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of our products and doing so may prove more difficult than expected or even impossible. For example, if expectations for greater functionality of the products drive costs up as other factors drive costs down, the result may be that the overall cost of manufacturing the product stays the same or even increases. Likewise, we currently provide service and support of our products for our customers at a high standard (both in and out of warranty), and plan on continuing to do so. Our business plan also assumes that as we continue to improve our product, we achieve improved levels of product reliability and decreased service cost and frequency, which also may prove more difficult than expected.\nWe may not be able to leverage our cost structure or achieve better margins.\nDue to the early stage of our commercial efforts, and particularly the early stage of customer adoption of our products, our current sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses are each a higher percentage of sales than they will need to be for us to reach profitability. While we do expect these expenses to grow as our business grows, we also expect these expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time. If we are unable to leverage these costs and grow revenues at a greater pace than these operating expenses as we expect, we will not be able to achieve viable operating margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.\nThe operation of our business and our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays and advance capital equipment expenditures and commitments.\nWe have been largely dependent on capital raised through the sale of equity securities in various public and private offerings, and going forward will be largely dependent on capital raised in any future offerings, to implement our business plan and support our operations.\nBased upon the Company\u2019s current cash resources, the recent rate of using cash for operations and investment, and assuming modest increases in current revenue offset by incremental increases in expenses related to increased sales and marketing and research and development, and a potential increase in rental activity from its medical device business, the Company believes it has sufficient resources to meet its financial obligations into the third quarter of 2017. The Company will require significant additional financing. The Company intends to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through public or private equity and/or debt financings, corporate collaborations, or warrant solicitations.\nWe anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working or growth capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely. Financings, if obtained, may be on terms that are dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price at which existing stockholders purchased their shares.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in our accounting policies or in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. The accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets and liabilities, and financial results. We may be required or determine that it is appropriate to change our accounting policies or the manner in which they are implemented as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. A change in applicable rules, their interpretation, or their application could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside the U.S. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings and financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. Proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders or prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. The Company\u2019s current Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue an aggregate of 71,428,571 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. In addition, the terms of any new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders.\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of us. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of us by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the Board of Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent officers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nCash dividends have never been declared or paid on our common stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of common stock. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various public company reporting requirements. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, (a) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (b) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and (c) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five year period, including if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five year period. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the filings we have made with the SEC and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than information received from other public reporting companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choice we make to reduce disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nBeing a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act of 1934 and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management, and increases our expenses. Among other things, we are required to:\n\u00b7 maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u00b7 maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u00b7 prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws;\n\u00b7 institute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with respect to corporate governance; and\n\u00b7 involve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors, particularly directors willing to serve on our audit committee.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We previously reported a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the timing of the implementation of certain policies, processes and procedures that we have put in place since the Merger. Throughout 2014 and 2015, we continued to strengthen our internal control environment by implementing new policies, processes and procedures. Our remediation efforts, including the testing of these controls, continued into 2015. This material weakness was considered remediated in the fourth quarter of 2015, once these controls were shown to be operational for a sufficient period of time to allow management to conclude that these controls were operating effectively. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has reported on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. While we believe that the policies, processes and procedures we put in place are sufficient to render our internal controls over financial reporting effective, our initiatives may not prove successful and in the future management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach such a conclusion, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then (if required in the future) they may decline to attest to management\u2019s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nIn particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.\n***\nThe risks above do not necessarily comprise all of those associated with an investment in us.
