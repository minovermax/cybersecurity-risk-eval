{"cik": "3116", "company": "AKORN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider each of the risks described below before purchasing shares of our common stock. The risk factors set forth below are not the only risks that may affect our business. Our business could also be affected by additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Termination of the Merger Agreement and the Delaware Opinion\nThere are material uncertainties and risks associated with damage claims from the Fresenius parties' and Akorn's shareholders as a result of the termination of the April 2017 Merger Agreement.\nOn April 24, 2017, we signed the Merger Agreement with the Fresenius parties. On April 22, 2018, the Fresenius parties sent Akorn a notice terminating the Merger Agreement. After expedited litigation, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled on October 1, 2018, that the termination was valid. That ruling was upheld on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court on December 7, 2018. On February 20, 2019, the Fresenius parties filed a motion for leave to amend and supplement its counterclaim against Akorn in order to recover damages purportedly incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement. On February 28, 2019, the Court of Chancery denied the Fresenius parties\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended and supplemented counterclaim. Proceedings on the proposed damages counterclaim are currently ongoing.\nIn addition, various purported shareholders of Akorn have filed putative class action and derivative claims against Akorn, its directors and its officers relating to the Merger Agreement, Akorn\u2019s regulatory compliance status and/or Akorn\u2019s public statements and SEC filings. Proceedings in those cases are ongoing.\nBelow are material uncertainties and risks associated with the termination of the Merger Agreement, the ongoing litigation with the Fresenius parties and the pending shareholder litigations. If any of the risks develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results and ongoing operations, stock price or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nThe litigations may involve significant defense costs and indemnification liabilities and may result in significant monetary judgments against Akorn, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nThe litigations, whether or not resolved favorably, may damage our long-term reputation, attract adverse media coverage, interfere with our relationships with key stakeholders and/or interfere with our ability to attract and retain employees; and\n\u2022\nThe litigations may divert the attention of our employees and management, which may affect our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business.\nOur growth depends on our ability to timely and efficiently develop and successfully launch and market new pharmaceutical products.\nOur strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distribution channels and, when appropriate, the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels. We may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of new applications or may decide not to pursue applications that we have already submitted or had anticipated submitting. Our failure to develop new products or to receive regulatory approval of applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if approved, we may have technical challenges or capacity constraints that prevent successful launch and marketing of new products. Even if successfully launched, no assurance can be given as to the actual size of the market for any product or the level of profitability and sales of the product.\nBusiness interruptions at our manufacturing facilities can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe manufacture drug products at three domestic and one international manufacturing facilities, and we have contracted with a number of third parties to provide other manufacturing, finishing, and packaging services. We face a substantial risk to our business when any one or more of these facilities is shut down or unable to operate at full capacity as a result of business interruptions, governmental or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fire, contamination, power shortages,\nstrikes, terrorist acts, or natural or man-made catastrophic events. For example, we suspended manufacturing at our facility in Somerset, New Jersey during the latter part of 2018 to facilitate the acceleration of the move to our newly constructed laboratory; personnel and equipment requalification and training; and other various cGMP enhancements. This short-term disruption impaired our ability to produce and ship drug products to the market on a timely basis, which resulted in failure to supply penalties, late fees and other adverse impacts on our business.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated through the sale of products manufactured by third parties, the loss or failure of any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCertain of the pharmaceutical products that we market, representing a significant portion of our net revenue, are manufactured by third parties that serve as our only supplier of those products. Any delays or failure of a contract manufacturing partner to supply finished goods timely or in adequate volume could impede our marketing of those products. We expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our current manufacturing facilities. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to distribute such products as planned. Any delays or difficulties with third-party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a small number of wholesalers to distribute our products, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales, net revenue and accounts receivable. The following three wholesalers - Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson - accounted for approximately 83.0% of total gross sales and 61.7% of total net revenue in 2018, and constituted 85.5% of gross trade receivables as of December 31, 2018. In addition to acting as distributors of our products, these three companies also distribute a broad range of healthcare products on behalf of many other companies. The loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for our hospital, retail and other customers, could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. A change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these wholesale drug distributors also could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to significant disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Any significant disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft, misuse or malfeasance could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information. Any of these events could result in the loss of key information, impair our production and supply chain processes, damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses, and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and price of our common stock.\nWe depend on our employees and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to be successful, and failure to do so hinders successful execution of our business and development plans.\nOur performance depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of our key R&D personnel, other technical employees, managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, particularly for highly motivated and experienced R&D and other technical personnel. We are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel. As a result, from time to time, we have faced challenges in attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel, particularly during 2017 and 2018, which has adversely affected our business operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time, any of which may result in substantial losses, government enforcement actions, damage to our business and reputation and place a strain on our internal resources.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in legal proceedings, as a party or non-party witness, with both private parties and certain government agencies, including the FDA, DEA and SEC. For example, in 2018, several shareholders filed lawsuits and shareholder demands asserting that Akorn and its directors and officers violated Louisiana fiduciary duty law and federal securities laws. Other such matters include receiving and responding to inquiries and subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice - Antitrust Division, and U.S. and Department of Justice - Civil Division relating to industry drug pricing practices; being named defendants in a multidistrict litigation matter in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania relating to alleged price fixing by generic pharmaceutical manufactures; and DEA subpoenas. We incur substantial time and expense participating in these types of lawsuits and investigations, which also divert management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and normal operations. In addition, these matters and any other substantial litigation may result in verdicts against us or government enforcement actions, which may include significant monetary awards, judgments invalidating certain of our intellectual property rights and preventing the manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. When such disputes are resolved unfavorably, our business, financial condition and results of operations are adversely affected. Any litigation, whether or not successful, may also damage our reputation. See Part II, Item 8, Note 19 - \"Legal Proceedings.\nCharges to earnings resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) business acquisition accounting standards, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flow:\n\u2022\ncosts incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022\namortization of intangible assets acquired;\n\u2022\na reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;\n\u2022\nidentification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, contingent purchase price consideration, income tax contingencies and other non-income tax contingencies, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first;\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-acquisition activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition;\n\u2022\nchanges to contingent consideration liabilities, including accretion and fair value adjustments. A significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred.\nSuch charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow, and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $283.9 million and $285.0 million of Goodwill and Intangible assets, net, respectively on our consolidated balance sheet. During 2018 and 2017, we recorded impairments of Intangible assets of $231.1 million and $128.1 million, respectively.\nJohn N. Kapoor, Ph.D., through his stock ownership and his right to nominate up to three directors, could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and have substantial influence over our business strategies and policies.\nJohn N. Kapoor, Ph.D., is a principal shareholder. As of December 31, 2018, Dr. Kapoor beneficially owns approximately 23% of our common stock. In addition, through the Kapoor Trust and EJ Financial, Dr. Kapoor is entitled to nominate up to three persons to serve on our Board. Mr. Brian Tambi was nominated for these purposes. The other seats for nomination are vacant. Nomination of any directors to our Board or any trading of our common stock by Dr. Kapoor and his related parties could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Industry.\nMany of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe require raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. Many of these materials are available from only a single source and, in the case of many of our products, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified and qualified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if such active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned.\nSales of our products may be adversely affected by further consolidation of our customer base, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nDrug wholesalers, drug retailers, and group purchasing organizations have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Our net revenue and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, major distributors and other trade buyers, whether resulting from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition, since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, or any delay in receiving payments from a single customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur branded products may become subject to increased generic competition.\nTrends moving toward increased substitution and reimbursement of generics for cost-containment purposes may reduce and limit the sales of our off-patent branded products. For example, our branded product Cosopt\u00ae PF faced generic competition in late 2018. Increased focus by the FDA on approval of generics may accelerate this trend.\nChanges in technology could render our products obsolete.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. The products that we sell today and their drug delivery methods may be replaced by more effective methods to deliver the same care, rendering our current products obsolete. Further, the technologies that we invest in for future use may not become the preferred method of delivery.\nRisks Related to Regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations. When regulations change or we fall out of compliance, we can face increased costs, additional obligations, fines, or halts to our operations.\nNew, modified and additional regulations, statutes or legal interpretation, which occur from time to time among other things, require changes to manufacturing methods, expanded or different labeling, recall, replacement or discontinuation of certain products, additional record keeping procedures, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and additional scientific substantiation. Such changes or new legislation can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of the regulatory risks that we are subject to are outlined below:\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. The FDA also\nregulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs. A finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with FDA requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs previously disclosed in various reports filed with the SEC, the Company, with the assistance of outside consultants, has been investigating alleged breaches of FDA data integrity requirements relating to product development at the Company. The Company has informed the FDA regarding the investigation and will continue to update the FDA as it proceeds. During 2018, we had FDA inspections at our Decatur and Somerset facilities that resulted in Official Action Indicated (\u201cOAI\u201d) facility status and we received a warning letter in early 2019 related to the 2018 Decatur inspection. In 2018, significant costs were incurred to address the FDA observations from the inspections of our Decatur and Somerset facilities. If we are unable to adequately address the FDA\u2019s concerns in a timely manner, the FDA may take further actions and our pipeline product approvals may be further delayed.\nWe must obtain approval from the FDA for each prescription pharmaceutical product that we market and the timing of such approval process is unknown and uncertain. The FDA approval process is typically lengthy, and approval is never certain. Our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies or impose other post-marketing obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on marketability and profitability of the new products.\nWe are subject to recalls and other enforcement actions by the FDA. The FDA or other government agencies having regulatory authority over pharmaceutical products may request us to voluntarily or involuntarily conduct product recalls due to disputed labeling claims, manufacturing issues, quality defects or for other reasons. Restriction or prohibition on sales, halting of manufacturing operations, recalls of our pharmaceutical products or other enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such actions, in certain circumstances, may constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing arrangements.\nIf the FDA changes its regulatory policies, it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain products. FDA interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies, industry trends, or prevailing scientific rationale. If the FDA changes its regulatory policies due to such factors, it could result in delay or suspension of the manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain of our products. In addition, modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process. Any change in the FDA\u2019s enforcement policy or any decision by the FDA to require an approved application for one of our products not currently subject to the approved application requirements or any delay in the FDA approving an application for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive DEA regulation, which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized if we are in non-compliance. The DEA could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances that we are permitted to manufacture and market or issue fines and penalties against us for non-compliance with DEA regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to timely and adequately address FDA warning letter and OAI facility status may adversely affect our business.\nDuring 2018, we had FDA inspections at our Decatur and Somerset facilities that resulted in OAI facility status and we received a warning letter in early 2019 related to the 2018 Decatur inspection. If we are unable to adequately address the FDA\u2019s concerns in a timely manner, the FDA may take further actions and our pipeline product approvals may be further delayed.\nChanges in healthcare law and policy may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe sales of our products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations including Pharmacy Benefit Managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d) and other healthcare-related organizations. We expect both federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments to continue to propose and pass new legislation, rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. Existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any\nproduct we develop in the future. In addition, PBMs and other third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products. Our products may not be considered cost effective, or adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments. Any such changes in healthcare law or policy may harm our ability to market our products and generate profits.\nThe FDA may require us to stop marketing certain unapproved drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe market several generic prescription products that do not have formal FDA approvals. These products are non-application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without formal FDA approval on the basis of their having been marketed by the pharmaceutical industry prior to the 1962 Amendments of the FDC Act. The FDA has increased its efforts to require companies to file and seek FDA approval for unapproved products, and when a product is approved, the FDA has typically increased its effort to remove other unapproved products from the market by issuing notices to companies currently manufacturing these products to cease its distribution of said products. In 2013, we discontinued marketing of a previously unapproved product after receipt of notice from the FDA. During 2018, we marketed six such unapproved products, generating net revenue of approximately $48.5 million.\nAny failure to comply with the complex reporting and payment obligations under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs may result in litigation or sanctions.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, marketing and pricing laws. We are also subject to Medicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations that are highly complex and at times ambiguous. Violations of these laws and reporting obligations are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In 2013, the Attorney General of the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Hi-Tech Pharmacal and numerous other pharmaceutical companies alleging that the defendants violated Louisiana state laws in connection with Medicaid reimbursement for certain vitamins, dietary supplements, and other products that were allegedly ineligible for reimbursement. In 2017, a similar lawsuit was filed by the State of Mississippi against the Company. If our past, present or future operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other similar governmental regulations, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and negatively impact our financial results. Further, if there is a change in laws, regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company and its employees are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes recordkeeping standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. If our employees, third-party sales representatives or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.\nThe FDA may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non-prescription basis, which may reduce the profitability of our prescription products.\nThe FDA may change the designation of some prescription pharmaceuticals we currently sell to non-prescription. If we are unable to gain approval of our product on a non-prescription designation we may experience an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Financing.\nWe may not be able to extend or replace the JPM Revolving Facility.\nThe JPM revolving facility while undrawn, provides a source of liquidity for the Company. This facility matures on April 17, 2019. If the Company is unable to extend or replace it prior to that time, this source of liquidity will no longer be available to the Company unless the Company is thereafter able to replace it with similar financing and there is no assurance that it would be able to do so on favorable terms if at all.\nEvents of default may occur under our debt instruments. If events of default occur and lenders under these debt instruments accelerate the obligations thereunder we may not be able to repay the obligations that become immediately due and the holders of our debt instruments may seek to assert their rights under the debt instruments.\nEvents of default may occur under our debt instruments. If events of default occur and lenders under these debt instruments accelerate the obligations thereunder we may not be able to repay the obligations that become immediately due. The terms of our Loan Agreement and Credit Agreement require us to remain in compliance with certain covenants. In the event that an event of default has occurred, the loans thereunder may become accelerated and immediately due. If we are not successful in refinancing our debt or accessing additional liquidity, we may not be able to fund all our commitments and will be in default under these obligations. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt when due, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional securities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders if needed or that other financing will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Any failure to meet our obligations under our debt instruments could have a material negative impact on our liquidity and on our business.\nOur indebtedness reduces our financial and operating flexibility.\nWe have entered into various credit arrangements to fund certain of our operations and activities, principally acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018, our debt includes The Existing Term loan and Incremental Term Loan, collectively the \u201cTerm Loans,\u201d with a remaining principal balance of $831.9 million. We also have available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities (See Part II, Item 8, Note 7 - \u201cFinancing Arrangements\u201d for definitions and descriptions of our Term Loans and our credit facilities). A high level of indebtedness subjects us to a number of risks. In particular, a significant portion of our current indebtedness has variable interest terms meaning we are subject to the risks associated with higher interest rates, and moreover, a high level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. In addition, our current debt arrangements require that we devote a significant portion of our cash flows to service amounts outstanding under those debt arrangements. We also are subject to various covenants with respect to our indebtedness, including the obligation to meet certain defined financial ratios and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders is restricted. Further, our indebtedness may restrict or otherwise impair our ability to raise additional capital through other debt financing, which could restrict our ability to grow our business. Our ability to meet our debt obligations, to comply with all required covenants, and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt when due, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional shares of securities. We may not be able to complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest and make required principal repayments on our Term Loans.\nThe outstanding balance of the Term Loans, which was $831.9 million as of December 31, 2018, is due and payable on April 17, 2021. If we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our principal and interest payment obligations when those obligations are due, which would place us into default under the terms of the Existing Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan. Such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our borrowings are secured by all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Existing Term Loan or the Incremental Term Loans, the lenders may be able to foreclose upon its security interest and otherwise be entitled to obtain or control Company assets. The lenders may also be able to negotiate significant increases in interest rates and fees.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital to grow our business, which could restrict our ability to operate in a manner we deem to be in our best interest.\nWe may require additional funds in order to materially grow our business. We require substantial liquidity to implement long-term cost savings and productivity improvement plans, continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing facilities\nto increase capacity and support product development programs, meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities, to effect acquisitions and to run our normal business operations. We may seek additional funds through public and private financing, including equity and debt offerings. However, adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on favorable terms. Without sufficient additional capital funding, we may be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our product development, manufacturing, acquisition, licensing and marketing initiatives, or operations. Further, such additional financing, if obtained, may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent or delay us from manufacturing and selling some of our new products.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products frequently sue companies that file applications to produce generic equivalents of their patented brand products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, which may delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market. Generally, a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent(s) on the brand name drug expire or are held to be not infringed, invalid, or unenforceable. When we or our development partners submit a filing to the FDA for approval of a generic drug, we or our development partners must certify: (i) that there is no patent listed by the FDA as covering the relevant brand product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the brand product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the brand product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the filing will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent, or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the brand drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the filing is submitted.\nUnder any circumstance in which an act of infringement is alleged to occur, there is a risk that a brand pharmaceutical company may sue us for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Also, competing pharmaceutical companies may file lawsuits against us or our strategic partners alleging patent infringement or may file declaratory judgment actions of non-infringement, invalidity, or unenforceability against us relating to our own patents. We have been sued for patent infringement related to several of our filings and we anticipate that we may be sued once we file for other products in our pipeline. Such litigation is often costly and time-consuming and could result in a substantial delay in, or prevent the introduction and/or marketing of our products, allow for damages for any at-risk launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if the parties settle their intellectual property disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties, and the necessary licenses might not be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable.\nOur patents and proprietary rights may be challenged, circumvented or otherwise compromised by competitors, which may result in our protected products losing their market exclusivity and becoming subject to generic competition before their patents expire.\nThe patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and is the subject of much litigation. There can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights, including licensed rights, relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured, or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights, if any, will provide protection against competitors who: (i) successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights; (ii) obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business; or (iii) are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position. It is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us, which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed therefrom. Consequently, others could independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop, or duplicate any of our products. Our inability to obtain patents for, or other proprietary rights in, our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or cause to be obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our inability to successfully defend the existing patents on our products against Paragraph IV challenges by competing drug companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the patents that protect Azasite\u00ae that will\nexpire in March 2019, were challenged by two generic competitors. We settled with one competitor and the courts found in our favor with the other. Additionally, the Zioptan\u2122 patents faced challenges from two generic competitors. We ultimately reached settlements with both competitors.\nFurther, the majority of the drug products that we market are generics, with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached. While this fact allowed us the opportunity to obtain FDA approval to market our generic products, it also allows competing drug companies to do the same. Should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market, our profit margins could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock.\nThe issuance of shares related to the Company\u2019s various stock plans may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, holders of unvested restricted stock units would receive 1.6 million shares of our common stock should all their restricted stock units vest. If the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise of any stock options is in excess of the various exercise prices of such options, exercise of such options would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, holders of our outstanding options would receive 3.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $28.55 per share.\nOur announced stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn July 2016, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program (the \"Stock Repurchase Program\") that would allow the Company to effect repurchases from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. During 2016, the Company repurchased a total of approximately 1.8 million shares at an average price of $24.89 per share of common stock. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program has depended on a variety of factors, including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. Any repurchases pursuant to such program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will occur or that if they do, that they will enhance stockholder value as the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. In addition, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nWe may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the market value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to a total of 5 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series subject to certain limitations, without further action by holders of our common stock. If we did issue shares of preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the market value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.", "PERMNO": 10180, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AKRXQ"}
