RISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering investments in our company, you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting the Company and our business in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties the Company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and may be material. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case or in the case that an additional risk or uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial develops into actual events or the materiality increases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nRisks Related to Customer Relationship\nThe loss of a significant customer relationship or the delay of large or multiple contracts or a strategic project may negatively impact our financial performance.\nA significant portion of our product sales are based on individual purchase orders with no guaranteed volumes and no committed purchase times beyond the specifics of the particular order. The loss of a significant customer relationship could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, customers may not place expected orders or delay them for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022delay in overall project timing, which may be due to a wide variety of economic, political, project-specific, weather-related, or other factors;\n\u2022customer decisions to switch to a competitor, which may be driven by product quality, performance, pricing or service;\n\u2022a decision by a customer to self-manufacture, thereby replacing our products;\n\u2022merger or acquisition activities by or involving our customer;\n\u2022significant downturn in the overall construction demand;\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe length and depth of product and industry business cycles in our segments may result in periods of reduced sales, earnings and cash flows, and portions of our business are subject to seasonality, weather-related effects and other adverse events outside our control\nOur construction business is cyclical in response to economic conditions and construction demand and is also seasonal and dependent on favorable weather conditions, with a decrease in construction activity during the winter months, periods of wet weather and times when other weather and climate conditions would impair construction activity. Extreme weather events, natural disasters and public health or safety emergencies on a global, regional or national level could also have material adverse impacts on our business and financial results. Moreover, it is possible that weather and climate volatilities and associated events could increase significantly in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may in the future continue to adversely affect, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity\nIn December 2019, the COVID-19 virus was first identified in China and has since spread to a number of countries in which we conduct our business operations, including countries in North America, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant worldwide economic uncertainty which has adversely affected, and may in the future continue to adversely affect, demand for our products due to delays in construction projects and reduced construction activity, especially commercial construction. Our results of operations in 2020 have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 and may continue to be negatively impacted in future periods. We may also be negatively impacted by reductions in accounts receivable collections, customer and vendor bankruptcies, increased raw material and transportation costs, as well as significant reduction in the availability of or substantial delays or interruptions in the supply or transportation of raw materials which could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has also significantly increased economic uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the cost of and accessibility to capital. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a significant economic slowdown, which could be of an unknown duration, could lead to increased unemployment, reduced discretionary consumer spending and a corresponding reduction in demand for our products, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe virus also impacted our workforce, moving a large portion of our employees to working-from-home and adding administrative complexity to our everyday business activities. Disruption caused by business responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, including working-from-home arrangements, may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage our reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease net revenues, and expose us to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe operate facilities around the world which have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the pandemic as a result of disruptions to our supplies of raw materials, as well as the production, transportation and delivery of our products. We may not be able to supply products or services to our customers in a timely manner due to travel and transportation restrictions, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers as a result of regulations imposed by local governments to contain COVID-19. Our ability to adequately staff our operations may be adversely impacted by certain temporary restrictions, such as mandatory facility closures imposed by government authorities in certain countries where we operate, as well as voluntary facility closures or other measures, such as work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, imposed for the safety of our employees or in response to actual or potential positive diagnoses for COVID-19. Despite our best efforts to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees in accordance with guidelines issued by national and other health and safety authorities, there can be no assurance that the numbers of infected employees will not increase, and that such infections would not have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nFurthermore, our efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through social distancing measures, enhanced cleaning measures, the increased use of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing at our facilities, as well as other steps taken to protect the health, safety and financial security of our employees, may result in other negative impacts on our operations, including increased costs, reduced efficiency levels or labor disputes resulting in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption.\nGovernments around the world have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, however, the magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain. Further, the full extent of the impact of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on our business and financial condition, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. We cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and reactions thereto will continue, and we expect to face difficulty in accurately predicting our internal financial forecasts.\nRisks Related to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in decline in the market price of our common stock, material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or cause our access to the capital markets to be impaired.\nManagement\u2019s assessment has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting- see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management is developing a remediation plan intended to address the deficiencies which resulted in the material weaknesses. We may identify deficiencies or other material weaknesses, in addition to the ones already identified, which we may not be able to remediate in a timely manner. If we continue to have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, or delays in completing our internal control audit and financial statement audit, could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future, which in turn could impact our ability to raise equity financing if needed in the future. While we believe our reported balances within our consolidated financial statements are accurate, until these material weaknesses are remediated, it is possible that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements reflected in our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Raw Materials and Supply Chain\nPrices of certain raw materials used in our production processes are volatile and can have a significant effect on our manufacturing and supply chain procurement strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile raw material prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our earnings.\nWe use petroleum-based materials, natural gas derivatives and other materials to manufacture our products. Prices for these materials are volatile and can have a significant effect on our pricing, sales, manufacturing and supply chain strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. Our ability to successfully adjust strategies in response to volatile raw material prices by increasing prices for our products and services, reducing costs or taking other actions is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile raw material prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our sales and earnings in future periods.\nA substantial portion of our raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. We attempt to manage exposure to price volatility of major commodities through:\n\u2022long-term supply contracts;\n\u2022customer contracts that permit adjustments for changes in prices of commodity-based materials and energy; and\n\u2022forward buying programs that layer in our expected requirements systematically over time.\nAlthough we regularly assess our exposure to raw material price volatility, we cannot always predict the prospects of volatility and we cannot always cover the risks we face in a cost-effective manner.\nWe have a policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials. However, certain of our raw materials may be provided by single or sole sources of supply. We may experience shortages of raw materials, other unforeseen developments that would cause an interruption in supply, or experience fluctuations in the prices of our raw materials due to COVID-19. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for raw materials, these sources may not make up for the loss of a major supplier.\nSome of our products are either tolled or contract manufactured by third party providers, and similar potential exposures exist where these are single or sole supply relationships.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nThe global scope of our operations subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate our business on a global scale with approximately half of our 2020 sales generated outside of the United States. We operate in over 30 countries and in over 30 currencies. We currently have many production facilities, technical centers and administrative and sales offices located outside of North America, including facilities and offices in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We expect non-U.S. sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and economic conditions and regulatory requirements of many jurisdictions, as well as risks related to the political relationship between the foreign countries in which we conduct business and the United States.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Government policies on international trade and investments, such as economic and trade sanctions against certain countries, governments and/or individuals, employment regulations, repatriation of earnings, import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect our business, including: demand for our products and services, impact on the competitive position of our products, difficulty enforcing commercial agreements, obtaining export licenses or transferring our profits or capital from foreign operations to other countries where such funds could be more profitably deployed, increase our shipping costs, prevent us from being able to procure supplies and materials, or manufacture or sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, or between any other countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including changes in applicable trade regulations as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU (\"Brexit\"), could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government's policies on tariffs and trade, or retaliation by another government against such policies, may result in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collection of customer receivables. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, as well as to political and economic instability. Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate changes that impact our profitability and these risks could increase as a result of global political uncertainty and other risks in international markets.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate risk through our global operations. A substantial portion of our net sales and assets are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, at a constant level of business, our reported sales, earnings, assets and liabilities are reduced because the foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. In addition, since we manufacture a portion of our construction products in emerging regions using raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar, the euro and the currencies of other advanced economies in which we purchase raw materials, may adversely affect our raw material costs and results of operations.\nWe incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction risks effectively, which may expose our financial condition or results of operations to significant additional risk.\nCertain of business activities outside of the United States require direct or indirect interaction with governmental entities, subjecting us to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in some countries our direct customer or one or several key stakeholders in projects that we sell products to would be state-controlled entities (SOEs).\nThe FCPA and other anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because certain of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities, we are subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, these regulations are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and pose a high risk for such practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of anti-bribery laws or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe have debt obligations that could restrict our business, adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or restrict our ability to return cash to shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $351.7 million of indebtedness outstanding. The amount of and terms governing the Company's indebtedness may have material effects on our business, including to:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, distributions to holders of company common stock and other purposes;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable business opportunities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, credit and industry conditions, including recessions;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets to raise funds, incur certain liens, or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other purposes.\nIf we fail to comply with certain restrictions imposed by our debt agreements, including maintaining the financial ratios required by our credit facilities, our debt could be accelerated and the Company may not have sufficient cash to pay the accelerated debt. Please refer to Note 8, \"Debt and Other Borrowings,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the information related to our debt obligations.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our indebtedness may intensify.\nWe have unfunded and underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require future operating cash flow to fund these liabilities. We have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations.\nWe maintain U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees who meet or met age and service requirements. Our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In addition, any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans, as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years which would potentially impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Innovation and Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to continue our technological innovation and successful introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other suppliers to meet their requirements.\nThe specialty chemicals and building materials industries, as well as the end-use applications into which we sell our products, experience ongoing technological change and product improvements. A key element of our business strategy is to invest in research and development activities with the goal of introducing new high-performance, technically differentiated products and innovative solutions. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations or fail to improve our products in response to our customers\u2019 needs, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of reduced sales of our products. Moreover, for these innovative products, market adoption may face challenges relative to customer acceptance or technical or regulatory hurdles.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material intellectual property or there is a loss in the actual or perceived value of our brands.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material patents, trademarks and other proprietary information. We have numerous valuable patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks and trade names, including certain marks that are significant to our business. We routinely seek to protect our patents, trademarks, and other confidential information and know-how by taking appropriate preventive and enforcement measures. Despite our efforts, unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nThe reputation of our branded products depends on numerous factors, including the successful advertising and marketing of our brand names, consumer acceptance, continued trademark validity, the availability of similar products from our competitors, and our ability to maintain our products\u2019 quality and technological advantages and claims of superior performance. A loss of a brand or the actual or perceived value of our brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products, and could negatively impact our business and financial condition. IP protection varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and such inconsistencies may pose a threat to the value of our IP.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims relative to third party intellectual property (\"IP\") rights that could adversely affect our business, despite our efforts to monitor the published patent and trademark applications of our competitors. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of the claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending, and resolving the claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. If we are found to be infringing on the IP rights of others, we may be held liable for damages, and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products, pay others to obtain a license under their IP rights, stop using the contested trademark or technology, or stop producing or selling the infringing product. On the other hand, even if we were to prevail in establishing non-infringement, invalidity, and/or non-enforceability of the IP rights being asserted against us, the existence of the lawsuit could prompt our customers to switch to products that are not the subject of the lawsuit.\nRisks Related to Workforce\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel.\nThe market for highly-skilled workers and leaders in our industry is competitive. In late 2020, we changed our Chief Executive Officer and several other senior executives. These changes may result in changes in our business strategy. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Doing so may be impacted by a number of factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our executives and other existing employees and attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nSome of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws in the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 50 of our U.S. employees are unionized. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws in the United States. In some, such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with legal representatives of employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. A strike, work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees, whether or not related to these negotiations, could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.\nIf we are unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our results of operations may be adversely impacted\nIn order to operate more efficiently, reduce costs and improve profitability, we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. We announced restructuring plans in 2017, 2018 and in 2019 and may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of restructuring activities and initiatives are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current or future restructuring plans, we may not realize expected cost savings, operating efficiencies and profitability improvements and our operations could be adversely affected. Risks associated with these actions include workforce management issues, additional unexpected costs, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, adverse impact on employee morale and failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. Any of such risks may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nA failure of our information technology systems could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (IT) infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. Our IT systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, malware or other malicious code, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, phishing attacks, ransomware, account takeovers, denial of service attacks, human error, disruption, loss or destruction of data, natural disasters, power outages and other similar disruptions. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in a loss or damage to our data it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future and to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, such as investigative and remediation costs, the costs of providing individuals and/or data owners with notice of the breach, legal fees, the costs of any additional fraud detection activities, or the costs of prolonged system disruptions or shutdowns.\nWe are subject to data privacy regulations.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Regulations around data protection and data privacy in the U.S., Europe, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), and elsewhere in the world can be complex and interpretations of such regulations are evolving. Despite our internal controls and processes designed to protect sensitive information, there can be no assurance that such controls and processes will ensure we are fully compliant with all data protection and data privacy laws. Failure to adequately protect sensitive information and timely report any security incident may result in financial penalties that may be material to our financial results. In addition, our business may be materially impacted if a security incident causes significant damage to our relationships with our customers, employees, vendors or others.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health and Safety impacts of our operations\nWe may be required to spend significant amounts of financial resources on environmental compliance.\nAs a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and specialty building materials, we are subject to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. We expend funds to comply with such laws and regulations and attempt to implement sustainable practices across our global operations. Legislative and regulatory uncertainties make it difficult for us to project future spending and we may be required to make substantial or unanticipated investments to remain in compliance.\nWe work with dangerous materials that can injure our employees, damage our facilities and disrupt our operations.\nSome of our operations involve the handling of hazardous materials that may pose the risk of fire, explosion or the release of hazardous substances. Such events could result from operational failures, natural disasters or terrorist attacks, and might cause injury or loss of life to our employees and others, environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected plant or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. A disruption of our operations caused by these or other events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther Risks\nThe divestiture of our Darex business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn July 2017, we completed the sale of our Darex business to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA. We are still engaged in post-acquisition matters with Henkel in certain regions, which could negatively affect our results of operations. The Purchase and Sale Agreement with Henkel KGaA regarding the sale of our Darex Business dated July 3, 2017, contains obligations for us as sellers to indemnify Henkel as buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties, taxes, as well as certain covenants and liabilities. We cannot predict the nature of and amount of any indemnity obligations we may have to the purchaser. Such payments may be costly and may adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain functions.\nWe have centralized our manufacturing for certain Specialty Building Material products in single locations, such as Wuhan, China and Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, and certain administrative functions in designated centers around the world, such as Manila, Philippines, to improve efficiency and reduce costs. To the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled, manufacturing of certain SBM products or key business processes, such as invoicing, payments and general management operations, could be interrupted.\nOur growth strategy may include the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies to be integrated within an existing business or that may operate independent of existing businesses. Acquisitions of these types involve numerous risks, which may include a failure to realize expected revenue growth and operating and cost synergies from integration initiatives, increasing dependency on the markets served by the combined businesses or increased debt to finance the acquisitions. Further, acquisitions of new businesses could increase the possibility of diverting corporate management\u2019s attention from its existing operations.\nThe successful execution of our acquisition strategy with respect to existing businesses, and within acquired standalone businesses, and increases in profitability overall, is dependent upon successful integration. If these integration initiatives do not occur, there may be a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSuch acquisitions and their subsequent integration involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022inaccurate assessments of disclosed liabilities and the potentially adverse effects of undisclosed liabilities\u037e\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, their products, and their culture into our existing business\u037e\n\u2022unforeseen delays in realizing the benefits from acquired companies or product lines, including projected efficiencies, cost savings,\n\u2022revenue synergies and profit margins\u037e\n\u2022unforeseen diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business matters\u037e\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties resulting from insufficient prior experience in any new markets we may enter\u037e\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties in retaining key employees and customers of acquired businesses\u037e and\n\u2022increases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could in turn restrict our ability to raise additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy.\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which may affect our earnings and earnings per share.\nOur quarterly effective income tax rate is influenced by our annual projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. Factors that affect the effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the requirement to exclude from our quarterly worldwide effective income tax calculations losses in jurisdictions in which no tax benefit can be recognized;\n\u2022actual and projected full-year pretax income;\n\u2022changes in tax laws in various taxing jurisdictions;\n\u2022audits by taxing authorities;\n\u2022the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized.\nRisks Relating to the Separation\nIf the distribution and certain related transactions fail to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions, Grace, the Company and Grace shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, the Company could be required to indemnify Grace for taxes and other related amounts, which may be material, pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement.\nAs a condition to the distribution that effected the Separation, Grace was required to receive an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to Grace in its sole discretion, regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions. The opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Grace and us, including those relating to our and Grace's past and future conduct. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Grace or GCP breach any of its covenants in the Separation documents, such as the Tax Sharing Agreement, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions failed to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel were based were false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. The\nopinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the distribution is determined to fail to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions, then, in general, Grace may recognize taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value (unless Grace and GCP jointly make an election under Section 336(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) with respect to the distribution, in which case, in general, we would (i) recognize taxable gain as if we had sold all of our assets in a taxable sale in exchange for an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock and the assumption of all of our liabilities and (ii) obtain a related step up in the basis of our assets), and Grace shareholders at the time of the distribution who received shares of our common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into between Grace and GCP, we may be required to indemnify Grace against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (1) an acquisition under certain circumstances of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (2) other actions that we may take or fail to, or (3) any of our representations or undertakings made in connection with the Separation and the distribution being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. In addition, Grace, GCP and our respective subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from Separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material.\nIn connection with the Separation, Grace agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify Grace for certain liabilities. If the Company is required to act on these indemnities to Grace, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Grace indemnity may not be sufficient to insure the Company against the full amount of liabilities for which it may be allocated responsibility, and Grace may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, Grace agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Grace for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Grace in each case for uncapped amounts, as discussed further in Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions and Transactions with Grace,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Grace are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Grace has agreed to retain. Further, the indemnity from Grace may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Grace may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Grace any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of GCP Common Stock\nOur share price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022failures of our operating results to meet the estimates of security analysts or the expectations of shareholders or changes by security analysts in their estimates of our future earnings;\n\u2022announcements made by us or our customers, suppliers or competitors;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect us or our industry;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general economic, industry and stock market conditions;\n\u2022future sales of company common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022future issuances of our stock by us;\n\u2022repurchases under our share repurchase program;\n\u2022stockholder activism, which may disrupt operations, divert management and employee attention, cause uncertainty that could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees, and require us to incur significant fees and expenses; and\n\u2022the other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on this Form 10-K.\nDuring 2020, Starboard Value LP and certain of its affiliates ('Starboard\") with an ownership interest of approximately 9% of our outstanding common shares, filed a proxy statement with the SEC seeking an election of eight of its nominees to the GCP Board of Directors at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d). At the Annual Meeting held on May 28, 2020, our stockholders voted to elect all eight nominees designated by Starboard to serve on GCP's Board of Directors. In the latter half of 2020, we changed our Chief Executive Officer and several other senior executives. During 2020, we incurred $9.5 million of shareholder activism and other related costs.\nOur share repurchase program may not be the most effective use of our capital and, if shares are repurchased under the program, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. While the Board authorized a share repurchase program, no shares have been repurchased to date\nOn July 30, 2020, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to a maximum of $100 million of our common stock through July 30, 2022. Share repurchases under the program may be made from time to time at the Board's discretion through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The share repurchase program is subject to a periodic review by the Board and may be suspended periodically or discontinued at any time. We plan to fund repurchases from our existing cash balance. No shares were repurchased during 2020.There can be no assurance that we will buy shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program or that any repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share. We could discontinue or decrease our share repurchases due to unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time that would require significant cash outlays, and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing shares.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s corporate documents, the Stockholder Rights Plan, the Tax Sharing Agreement and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change-in-control of the Company, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some Company shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our stockholder rights plan and of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022authorization of a large number of shares of common or preferred stock that are not yet issued, which may permit our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of the Company's management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of the Company;\n\u2022prohibition on shareholders calling special meetings and taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the Company's Board of Directors and for proposing matters to be acted on by shareholders at the annual shareholder meetings; and\nWe adopted a stockholder rights plan on March 15, 2019. The rights plan is not intended to prevent a takeover, and we believe it will enable all GCP stockholders to realize the full potential value of their investment in the Company and protect the Company and its stockholders from efforts to obtain control of GCP that are inconsistent with the best interests of GCP and its stockholders. The rights plan may impose a significant penalty upon any person or group that attempts to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock) without the approval of the Board of Directors. The rights under the plan were initially set to expire on\nMarch 14, 2020. On March 13, 2020, the Board extended the final expiration date of the Rights Agreement to March 14, 2023, subject to stockholders' approval at GCP's 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders which was obtained on May 28, 2020.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Company's Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of company common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing the Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal as compared to its long-term plan as a standalone company. However, these provisions apply even if a proposal may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of GCP and our shareholders.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be required to indemnify Grace for any resulting tax and related amounts, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nOur bylaws include a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach or a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrines, will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware). This forum selection provision of our bylaws may limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our bylaws, a court could rule that such a provision in inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThe Company may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of company common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of company common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThe Company does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings to finance our business. As a result, GCP does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. All decisions regarding the payment of dividends by GCP will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends at any time in the future. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or other currently unknown reasons. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate in order for your investment to increase in value. This appreciation may not occur. Further, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.", "PERMNO": 15917, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "GCP"}
