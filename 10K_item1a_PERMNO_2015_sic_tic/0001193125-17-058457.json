Risk Factors\nYou should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Our CA Business\nWe are dependent on agreements with our airline partners to be able to access passengers. Payments for our passenger services have provided, and we expect will continue to provide, a significant portion of our revenue. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from these agreements on a timely basis or to renew any existing agreements upon expiration or termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had our equipment installed and provided our Gogo service to passengers on aircraft operated by nine airlines, we had a definitive contract with one additional airline and we had letters of intent or memoranda of understanding with five additional airlines. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Gogo service we provide to passengers on commercial aircraft operated by our airline partners generated approximately 64%, 63% and 60% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Our ability to meet our commitments to certain of our customers will require us to reach agreements with OEMs, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. As of December 31, 2016, in addition to the 2,943 commercial aircraft on which we were providing service, we had awards or contracts to install approximately 700 additional aircraft. Our growth is dependent on our ability to have our equipment installed on additional aircraft and increased use of the Gogo service on installed aircraft. Any delays in installations under these contracts may negatively affect our ability to grow our user base and revenue. In addition, we have no assurance that any of our current airline partners will renew their existing contracts with us upon expiration, or that they will not terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of certain contractually stipulated events. Contractual termination events include our bankruptcy and our material breach of contract, which in certain contracts is defined to include material breach of our service level agreements, and/or failure to achieve certain certification, equipment delivery, installation or other milestones within agreed-upon time frames. Several contracts with airline partners permit such airline to terminate the contract if the percentage of passengers using connectivity on such airline\u2019s flights falls below certain negotiated thresholds. One contract with an airline partner from which we derive a significant portion, but less than a majority, of our CA-NA segment revenue permits such airline partner to terminate its contract with us if the airline\u2019s revenue share falls below certain negotiated thresholds based on the airline\u2019s costs incurred to provide the service and Gogo elects to not make the airline whole for such revenue share shortfall. Contracts with our airline partners from which we derive a significant portion, but less than a majority, of our CA-NA segment revenue allow those airlines to terminate a portion or all of their respective agreements after a specified time period upon the payment of a termination fee. Additionally, our contracts with American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and certain other airline partners, from which we derive a majority of our CA-NA segment revenue, permit such airline partners to terminate all or a portion of their contracts with us if another company provides an alternate connectivity service that is a material improvement over passenger connectivity, such that failing to adopt such service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price,\ntechnology and schedule. Under the Unified Agreement with American Airlines, approximately 550 Gogo-installed mainline aircraft became subject to deinstallation at American Airlines\u2019 option, and we expect such aircraft to be deinstalled or retired over the next several years. To the extent that our airline partners terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nCertain of our contracts with our airline partners include provisions that, under certain circumstances, entitle our airline partners to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other airline partners\u2019 connectivity agreements, including terms related to termination, maintenance, service and pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. In addition, our inability to identify and offer improved terms to an airline partner in accordance with such a provision could negatively affect our relationship with that airline partner or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such connectivity agreement.\nA failure to maintain airline satisfaction with our equipment or the Gogo service could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nOur relationships with our airline partners are critical to the growth and ongoing success of our business. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, use of the Gogo service on Delta Air Lines aircraft accounted for approximately 27%, 28%, and 26%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 use of the Gogo service on American Airlines aircraft (including legacy US Airways aircraft) accounted for approximately 23%, 22%, and 22%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. If our airline partners are not satisfied with our equipment or the Gogo service for any reason, including passenger dissatisfaction with the service as a result of capacity constraints, they may reduce efforts to co-market the Gogo service to their passengers, which could result in lower passenger usage and reduced revenue, which could in turn give certain airlines the right to terminate their contracts with us. In addition, airline dissatisfaction with us for any reason, including delays in obtaining certification for or installing our equipment or meeting our service level obligations, could negatively affect our ability to expand our service to additional airline partners or aircraft or lead to claims for damages, which may be material, or termination rights under existing contracts with our airline partners.\nWe are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our ability to maintain sufficient network capacity and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nProviders of wireless connectivity services, including providers of in-flight connectivity services and particularly ATG providers, face certain limits on their ability to provide connectivity service, including escalating capacity constraints due to expanding consumption of wireless services and the increasing prevalence of higher bandwidth uses such as file downloads and streaming media content. The success of our CA business depends on our ability to provide adequate bandwidth to meet customer demands while in-flight. Our ATG network is inherently limited by the spectrum licensed and we are currently experiencing capacity constraints in the United States, particularly on certain flights where demand for our service is high and certain routes on which a number of aircraft are within range of the same cell site at one time, and we expect demand to continue to increase in the United States as penetration rates increase and our service becomes available on more aircraft. As part of our effort to alleviate such constraints, we are continuing to develop and implement our \u201ctechnology roadmap,\u201d including developing our next generation air-to-ground technology, using unlicensed 2.4 GHz spectrum and the implementation of 2Ku. The roadmap is intended to increase our capacity demands through a number of improvements, including the use of ATG-4, 2Ku and planned implementation of the 2.4 GHz technology.\nWe started rolling-out our 2Ku service during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, 2Ku was installed on 94 CA aircraft operated by five airline partners and an additional 450 to 550 aircraft are expected to be installed during 2017. Our ability to meet our installation schedule is dependent on certain variables not within our control, including the availability of aircraft and the speed with which we are able to obtain STCs from the FAA and similar foreign regulatory agencies for our 2Ku equipment. If we are unable to continue to upgrade aircraft to 2Ku on a timely basis, our significant capacity constraints in the United States may continue. The successful and timely deployment of our 2Ku solution is subject to various risks and uncertainties as described in this Risk Factors section under the heading \u201c- We may be unsuccessful or delayed in widely deploying and operating our 2Ku technology.\u201d In addition, there is no guarantee that the use of satellite technology, including through the use of 2Ku, will effectively alleviate current or future capacity constraints. Implementation of satellite solutions will depend on the availability of capacity from satellite service providers, regulatory approvals for aeronautical services using those satellites, the installation of satellite equipment on aircraft, and demand from our airline partners for new installations of satellite equipment. In the past, we experienced delays in obtaining FAA approvals for certain components of our Ku-band equipment. Further, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications, and expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems using these new technologies. Any interruptions in operations during periods of implementation could adversely affect our ability to maintain satisfactory service levels, properly allocate resources and process billing information in a timely manner, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, reputational harm, termination of key contracts and delayed or reduced cash flow.\nWe are currently developing a next generation air-to-ground technology using unlicensed 2.4 GHz spectrum intended to further augment capacity in the contiguous United States. The inclusion of any such technology in our technology roadmap will require, among other things, that we integrate this unlicensed spectrum with our current ATG system and spectrum. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in developing and implementing the use of this spectrum, and our success developing and deploying this technology is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In addition, there is no guarantee that the deployment of such technology, alone or together with ATG-4 and 2Ku, will effectively alleviate future capacity constraints. We utilize a number of additional means to ensure our network meets passenger expectations, including the creation of effective price plans intended to calibrate usage while maximizing Gogo service revenue, and sophisticated bandwidth management tools, including through the use of bandwidth management software, provided under a third party contract, which, if terminated for any reason or expired and not renewed or replaced, could adversely impact our ability to meet increasing capacity demands.\nWe may in the future face capacity constraints internationally. There is no guarantee that our technology roadmap or the other means we utilize to manage our networks will be sufficient to alleviate capacity constraints in the United States or internationally. If we fail to meet our capacity demands, it could harm our reputation with customers, certain airline partners could terminate their contracts with us for a failure to meet our service level agreements or we could be unable to enter into new contracts with other airline partners, and our business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services and adopted broad new net neutrality rules. Depending on the ultimate interpretation of these requirements, they could constrain our ability to manage our network and make it more difficult for us to meet capacity demands. For example, covered broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices or impair, degrade or unreasonably interfere with lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices. The rules contain an exception for \u201creasonable network management.\u201d We believe that our network management practices are reasonable under the FCC\u2019s rules, but regulators may disagree with our interpretations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the airline industry, which is itself affected by factors beyond the airlines\u2019 control. The airline industry is highly competitive and sensitive to changing economic conditions.\nOur business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial aircraft, the financial condition of the airlines and other economic factors. If consumer demand for air travel declines, including due to increased use of technology such as videoconferencing for business travelers, or the number of aircraft and flights shrinks due to, among other reasons, reductions in capacity by airlines, the number of passengers available to use the Gogo service will be reduced, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions and other events that are beyond the airlines\u2019 control, including higher unemployment rates, higher interest rates, reduced stock prices, reduced consumer and business spending, outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist attacks or threats could have a material adverse effect on the airline industry. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending could result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in airline flights offered and the number of passengers flying. Consolidation within the airline industry could also adversely affect our relationships with our existing airline partners or lead to Gogo-equipped aircraft being taken out of service.\nFurther, unfavorable economic conditions could also limit airlines\u2019 ability to counteract increased fuel, labor or other costs though raised prices. Our airline partners operate in a highly competitive business market and, as a result, continue to face pressure on offerings and pricing. These unfavorable conditions and the competitiveness of the air travel industry could cause one or more of our airline partners to reduce expenditures on passenger services including deployment of the Gogo service or file for bankruptcy. If one or more of our airline partners were to file for bankruptcy, bankruptcy laws could give them rights to terminate their contracts with us, they could reduce their total fleet size and capacity and/or their total number of flights, and/or they could attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts with us including their revenue share percentage. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to grow our business with current airline partners or successfully negotiate agreements with airlines to which we do not currently provide the Gogo service.\nWe are currently in negotiations or discussions with certain of our airline partners to provide our equipment and the Gogo service on additional aircraft in their fleets. We have no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We are also in discussions with other airlines to provide our equipment and the Gogo service to some or all of the aircraft flying North American or international routes. Negotiations with current and prospective airline partners require substantial time, effort and resources. The time required to reach a final agreement with an airline is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter. We may ultimately fail in our negotiations and any such failure could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources, actual costs and opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities. In addition, the terms of any future agreements could be materially different and less favorable to us than the terms included in our existing agreements with our airline partners. Further, as the market for in-flight connectivity services matures, we expect commercial models and contract terms to continue to evolve, and we anticipate that third-party payors (including airlines) will generate an increasing portion of our revenue and that the portion of our revenue paid by passengers using our service will decline. We are unable to predict to what extent this shift will occur or the net effect of such shift on our revenue or results of operations. Our growth will also depend in part on our ability to reach agreements with OEMs, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. To the extent that any negotiations with current or potential airline partners are unsuccessful, or any existing or future agreements reflecting evolving business models prove generally less favorable to us than expected or as compared to agreements under previously existing models, our growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition from a number of companies, as well as other market forces, could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market share and could harm our results of operations.\nWe face competition from satellite-based providers of broadband services that include in-flight connectivity and in-flight entertainment, including live television services. Competition from such providers has in the past and could have in the future an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or gain market share. While as of December 31, 2016 we provided the Gogo service to approximately 67% of all Internet-enabled North American commercial aircraft, the increased availability, development and adoption of satellite-based services by commercial airlines in North America and the rest of the world has and will continue to put additional pressure on our ability to maintain our market leading position, and we expect our market share to decline as our competitors install more aircraft with their systems in the U.S. and internationally. Five major North American airlines provide Internet connectivity service supplied by our competitors on all or a portion of their fleets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of pricing pressures or periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers, including services we do not currently provide and/or may not provide in the future. In addition, while we are currently the only provider of ATG service in North America, existing or potential competitors are utilizing or may utilize licensed spectrum not currently designated for air-to-ground services or 2.4 GHz or other unlicensed spectrum to develop an ATG network. Internationally, one of our competitors is building a hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide aviation customers broadband service over Europe. Another competitor is also developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may be available in 2017. We anticipate that factory installation capabilities for new aircraft will be increasingly important for commercial airlines and aircraft owners and operators. We are in the process of obtaining these capabilities in commercial aviation; however, some of our competitors are further along in the process and may be selected as in-flight connectivity providers based on this capability. Competition within the in-flight broadband Internet access and in-cabin digital entertainment markets may also subject us to pricing pressures in terms of both passenger retail pricing and our negotiations with airlines. Pricing passenger service at too high a level could adversely affect the rate of consumer acceptance for the Gogo service, while increased competition for airline partners and aircraft or other market forces could force us to lower our prices or lose market share and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. In addition, to the extent that competing in-flight connectivity or entertainment services offered by commercial airlines that are not our airline partners are available on more aircraft or offer improved quality or reliability as compared to the Gogo service, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Competition could increase our sales and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to effectively respond to established and new competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur CA-ROW business has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.\nOur international expansion of our CA business began in the first quarter of 2014 and our first 2Ku installations took place in 2016. The limited operating history of our CA-ROW business may make it difficult to accurately evaluate the CA-ROW business and predict its future performance, and the growth of our CA-NA segment since inception is not necessarily indicative of potential future growth of CA-ROW. Any assessments of our current business and predictions that we or you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, and the size and nature of our market opportunity will change as we scale our business and increase deployment of the Gogo service. If we do not address any of the foregoing risks, our business could be harmed.\nWe face limitations on our ability to grow our domestic operations which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur addressable market and our ability to expand domestically are inherently limited by various factors, including limitations on the number of U.S. commercial airlines with which we could partner, the number of planes in which our equipment can be installed, the passenger capacity within each plane and the ability of our network infrastructure or bandwidth to accommodate increasing capacity demands. Expansion is also limited by our ability to develop new technologies and successfully implement our technology roadmap on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as our ability to mitigate network capacity constraints through, among other things, our access to licensed or unlicensed spectrum. Our growth may slow, or we may stop growing altogether, to the extent that we have exhausted all potential airline partners and as we approach installation on full fleets and maximum penetration rates on all flights. In such circumstances, to continue to grow our domestic revenue, we would have to rely on customer and airline partner adoption of currently available and new or developing services and additional offerings, including Gogo Vision, Gogo TV, various services made possible by our in-flight platform, and CAS. We cannot assure you that we will be able to profitably expand our existing domestic presence and, if we fail to do so, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally.\nOur efforts to expand the services provided by our CA business to aircraft flying internationally began in the first quarter of 2014. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability in our international business involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets, the amount of which investment is subject to certain limitations under the indenture governing our senior secured notes and may be limited by economic and financial market conditions, and the possibility that we may not realize a return on our investments in the near future or at all. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses before we generate any material revenue in these new markets. Under our agreements with providers of satellite capacity, we are obligated to purchase bandwidth for specified periods, as much as ten years in advance. If we are unable to generate sufficient passenger demand or airline partners to which we provide satellite service to their aircraft terminate their agreements with us for any reason during periods for which we have prepaid, we may incur satellite costs in excess of connectivity revenue generated through such satellites. Further, our expansion plans require significant management attention and resources and our CA business has limited experience in selling our solutions in international markets or in conforming to local cultures, standards or policies. Certain of our competitors, including current providers of satellite service, have more experience than we do in the international commercial airline connectivity and in-flight entertainment markets. As a result, such competitors may have pre-existing relationships with international airlines, may have obtained regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions or may already offer their equipment as standard, line-fit options on aircraft types, which may negatively affect our ability to enter into agreements with new international airline partners. Expansion of international marketing and advertising efforts could lead to a significant increase in our marketing and advertising expenses and would increase our customer acquisition costs. We may not be able to compete successfully in these international markets, and we may be unable to enter into agreements on favorable terms to provide connectivity services to international fleets of our existing North American airline partners and to new international airline partners. In addition, our ability to expand will be limited by the demand for in-flight broadband Internet access in international markets. Any failure to compete successfully in international markets could also negatively impact our reputation and domestic operations.\nOur current and future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory restrictions, including different communications, privacy, censorship, aerospace and liability standards, intellectual property laws and enforcement practices;\n\u2022\nchanges in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers and imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d);\n\u2022\ninability to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the (U.K.) Bribery Act 2010 and other similar corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and related risks;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to grow our business internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our future operating results and financial condition.\nOur technology roadmap calls for the continued roll-out of Ku-band satellite service via our 2Ku technology. To the extent that our satellite service providers do not satisfy our or our airline partners\u2019 needs for any reason, our agreements with our satellite service providers do not yield the expected benefits, we fail to meet sales targets and other milestones set forth in the agreements or we otherwise fail to maintain a good working relationship with our satellite service providers, our current or future providers of satellite service may be unable to support our current international expansion plans. In addition, to the extent we enter into additional contracts to provide satellite-based connectivity service to airline partners, we will be required to secure additional satellite capacity, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not secure sufficient satellite capacity, we may be unable to meet the connectivity needs of passengers or the minimum service level requirements specified in our connectivity agreements, which could cause us to be in breach of our connectivity agreements and otherwise negatively affect our ability to successfully develop our international business.\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in widely deploying and operating our 2Ku technology.\nOur 2Ku solution, which offers additional bandwidth and improved speeds for our connectivity service, as compared to our ATG service, became available to commercial aircraft in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,400 aircraft awarded, but not yet installed, and there can be no assurance that we can meet our installation goals on our current timeline, due to, among other things, the failure of any 2Ku-related technology and equipment to perform as expected, problems arising in the manufacturing process, our reliance on single-source suppliers to provide certain necessary components and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. In addition, other providers of satellite-based connectivity services currently have services available for commercial deployment that are intended to compete directly with 2Ku, and airlines may choose to adopt such a service over 2Ku. We currently have agreements with seven airlines to provide 2Ku to all or a portion of such airlines\u2019 fleets. The failure of 2Ku to perform as expected, or significant delays in our ability to install it, could result in material breaches of such agreements which could in turn result in termination of such agreements and liability to Gogo. In addition, five airlines have agreed or announced their intent to enter into definitive agreements with us. If 2Ku fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines for which we have contracted, our business, business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver 2Ku could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See also \u201c-We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our ability to maintain sufficient network capacity and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our next generation ATG technology.\nWe expect our next generation ATG solution, which will offer additional bandwidth and improved speeds for our connectivity service as compared to existing ATG technologies, to become available to commercial aircraft in 2018. There can be no assurance that we can meet our development goals on our current timeline, due to, among other things, integrating the use of licensed and unlicensed spectrum, utilizing the unlicensed spectrum to perform as we expect, the failure of any ATG-related technology and equipment to perform as expected, problems arising in the manufacturing process, our reliance on single-source suppliers to provide certain necessary components and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. If our next generation ATG fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines for which we have contracted, our business, business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver next generation ATG could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See also \u201c-We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our ability to maintain sufficient network capacity and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\u201d\nWe may be unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from Gogo Vision, our in-flight platform, Gogo TV, CAS and other services that we may offer in the future.\nThe future growth prospects for our CA business depend, in part, on airlines or passengers paying for Gogo Vision on-demand video services, Gogo TV and CAS. Our ability to generate revenue from such services and other services we may offer in the future depends on:\n\u2022\ngrowth of our customer base;\n\u2022\nrolling out our in-flight entertainment or such other services on more aircraft and with additional airline partners and increasing passenger adoption;\n\u2022\nour ability to customize and improve services in response to trends and customer interests; and\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and monetize CAS as described below under \u201c-We may not be successful in our efforts to develop and monetize new products and services that are currently in development, including our CAS.\u201d\nIf we are unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from these services and our in-flight platform, our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to develop and monetize new products and services that are currently in development, including CAS.\nIn order to continue to meet the evolving needs of our airline partners and customers, we must continue to develop new products and services that are responsive to those needs, including CAS. Our ability to realize the benefits of these services, including monetizing our services at a profitable price point, depends, in part, on the adoption and utilization of operational applications by airlines, other aircraft operators and other companies in the aviation industry such as aircraft equipment suppliers, and we cannot be certain that airlines, other aircraft operators and others in the aviation industry will adopt such offerings in the near term or at all. We also expect to continue to rely on third parties to develop and offer the operational applications to be used to gather and process data transmitted on our network between the aircraft and the ground, and we cannot be certain that such applications will be compatible with our network or onboard equipment or otherwise meet the needs of airlines or other aircraft operators. If we are not successful in our efforts to develop and monetize new products and services, including CAS, our future business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nA future act or threat of terrorism, cyber-security attack or other events could result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft.\nA future act of terrorism or cyber-security attack on an aircraft, the threat of such acts or unrelated airline accidents could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In the event of a terrorist attack or threat, cyber-security attack or threat or unrelated airline accident, the industry would likely experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government or foreign governments could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft, which would eliminate demand for our equipment and service. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or service and the threat of terrorism, cyber-security attacks or accidents involving aircraft on which our equipment or service operates would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our equipment and service. Reduced demand for our products and services would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAir traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards, increased security measures, new travel-related taxes, the outbreak of disease or any other similar event could harm the airline industry.\nAirlines are subject to cancellations or delays caused by factors beyond their control. Cancellations or delays due to weather conditions or natural disasters, air traffic control problems, including work stoppages or reduced government funding, breaches in security, outbreaks of communicable diseases or other factors could reduce the number of passengers on commercial flights and thereby reduce demand for the Gogo service and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our BA Business\nEquipment sales to OEMs and after-market dealers account for a substantial portion of our revenue and earnings in the BA segment, and the loss of an OEM or dealer customer could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nRevenue from equipment sales on contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers accounted for more than 30% of revenue generated by our BA segment for each fiscal period presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Almost all of our contracts with our OEM and dealer customers are terminable at will by either party and do not obligate our customers to purchase any of our equipment or services. If a key OEM or dealer terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed our business and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur OEM customers may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, our customers may be more conservative in their production, which would result in fewer new aircraft available to receive our equipment. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of our OEM customers to file for bankruptcy, which could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess, which could reduce the volume of products we can sell and our operating margins.\nOur BA equipment and service are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:\n\u2022\ndevelop service that is superior to our service;\n\u2022\ndevelop service that is priced more competitively than our service;\n\u2022\ndevelop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our BA segment are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market share and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our equipment. Further, we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, so we take the risk for cost overruns.\nMany of our OEM customers may terminate their contracts with us on short notice and, in many cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our equipment. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, the historical purchasing patterns of customers, and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM customers, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns. Also, we may accept a fixed-price contract for equipment that we have not yet produced, and the fact that we have not yet produced the equipment increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product.\nMany of the risks that could harm our CA business could also adversely affect our BA business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales of ATG equipment accounted for more than 60% of equipment revenue, and subscriptions for our Gogo Biz in-flight broadband Internet service accounted for more than 85% of service revenue for our BA segment. As such, many of the risks described above relating to our CA business and the Gogo service could also have a material adverse effect on our BA business, including expected capacity constraints on our network in the near-term and our ability to manage those constraints consistent with still-evolving interpretations of FCC rules, our ability to successfully develop and implement our next generation ATG technology, our ability to successfully implement technology enhancements to our network and our ability to successfully develop and deploy new products and services and generate revenue and profits from the sale of such products and services.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and Regulation\nOur CA-NA and BA businesses are dependent on our right to use spectrum exclusively licensed to us.\nIn June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of Airfone, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. Our applications to renew our licenses were recently granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions,\npermitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. Our ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S. and our failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to meet increasing capacity demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans for 2.4 GHz that we intend to use concurrently with the exclusive licenses.\nWhile our spectrum license allows us to be the exclusive provider of ATG broadband connectivity in the United States, additional ATG spectrum may become available in the United States or internationally in the future.\nWhile we are currently the only provider of ATG service in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity.\nThe availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a competitor has announced that it is also developing an ATG network using the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum. In addition, the FCC adopted an order establishing a more streamlined process for obtaining authority to provide satellite-based in-flight broadband service over the U.S., which could help facilitate the market entry of additional satellite-based competitors.\nWhile our international competition currently consists of satellite-based interconnectivity services, discussions are occurring in the European Union and elsewhere regarding the use of spectrum for ATG service and one such competitor has started to build a European hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide aviation customers connectivity service in Europe. As a result, we may face competition from such providers in such regions.\nWe face specific risks related to the provision of telecommunications and data services by satellite, capacity providers and equipment suppliers.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for services and equipment that we use to provide satellite telecommunication and connectivity services to commercial airline passengers and business aviation customers. We generated approximately 7%, 7%, and 7% of total BA segment revenue from subscriptions for voice and data services provided via satellite for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These voice and data services are provided in our BA segment through the resale on a non-exclusive basis of satellite-based telecommunications and data services owned and operated by third parties. We currently rely on two satellite partners to provide these services to our BA customers and have a number of satellite resellers as our competitors. Our agreements with our BA satellite partners are short-term in nature and one is subject to termination for convenience on 90 days\u2019 notice.\nWe also have agreements with several CA satellite partners to provide Ku-band satellite service on a non-exclusive basis. Service is typically provided through individual service orders for specified transponders, which range in duration from one to ten years. If any of these agreements were terminated or not renewed upon expiration, or if any of our satellite partners fail to obtain, or lose, necessary regulatory authorizations, we could face material delays or interruptions in the provision of service to our customers that rely on satellite service for connectivity or other voice and data services. If our agreements with any of our satellite partners were terminated or expired and were not renewed, we may not be able to find alternative satellite partners on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Certain of our agreements with satellite service providers commit us to purchase\nbandwidth up to ten years in advance, which may exceed passenger demand and require us to incur unnecessary costs. See \u201c-We may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally.\u201d\nWe also have agreements with third parties to provide the equipment, including radomes, antennas and modems, necessary for us to supply our Ku-band satellite service and to develop and supply our next generation ATG service, and such agreements have multi-year terms followed by automatic renewals. If any of our supplier agreements, or any other agreement with equipment providers, were terminated for any such reason or expired and were not renewed, or the equipment was not provided for in a timely basis or of a reliable quality, we may not be able to find alternative equipment providers on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could delay our ability to continue rolling out our service to airline partners and adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we are required to obtain regulatory approvals for the provision of satellite service from certain foreign telecommunications regulatory bodies.\nOur agreements with satellite providers and equipment suppliers may contain terms, such as those related to termination, pricing and service levels that are not consistent with our obligations under our connectivity agreements with airline partners that rely on such satellite service or equipment for connectivity. Such misalignment could cause us to be in breach of such connectivity agreements, and we may be unable to seek indemnification for such losses from our satellite service providers and equipment providers. Further, if our satellite partners or equipment providers were to increase the fees they charge us for resale of their services and we could not pass these increased costs on to our customers, it would increase our cost of service revenue and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license.\nUnder the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures or damage to our equipment.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our in-flight website, network infrastructure, content delivery processes and payment systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slowed down our website\u2019s performance and users\u2019 access to the Internet, or made our website inaccessible, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures in the future, which may be due to factors beyond our control. In the past, service failures or delays of our website have been remedied by bypassing the payment processing step for users and directly connecting such users to the Internet, leading to a loss of revenue for those sessions. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, we may lose revenue to the extent that we have to bypass the payment processing step in order to maintain customers\u2019 connectivity to the Internet and our airline partners may have the right to terminate their contracts with us or pursue other remedies.\nOur operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which would suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access. In addition, the satellites upon which we rely for current and will rely for future services are and will be subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, which have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of various factors, such as satellite design and manufacturing defects, problems with the power or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space. Damage to our or third parties\u2019 networks could cause interruptions in the services that we provide. Such interruptions in our services could have a material adverse effect on service revenue, our reputation and our ability to attract or retain customers.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers, for certain critical components of our networks and operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers, for a number of critical components of our ATG, next generation ATG, Ku and 2Ku networks and operations. For example, we purchase all of the aircards used for our ATG and ATG-4 equipment from a single provider, an affiliate of which we believe holds all of the patents for these components. If we are required to find one or more alternative suppliers for aircards or any other component for which we may rely on a single source supplier, we may not be able to contract with them on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, we purchase equipment for all of the ATG, including ATG-4, and next generation ATG base stations used at our cell-sites from a single provider. The base stations used at our cell-sites may require six to nine months lead time to produce and are highly integrated with other components of our network. If we needed to seek one or more alternate suppliers for our base stations, we estimate that it could take up to two years or more before any such alternate supplier could deliver a component that meets our network requirements. We also license all of our ATG-4 bandwidth optimization software from a single provider. If we are required to find one or more alternative suppliers for this or comparable software, we may not be able to contract with them on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Similarly, with respect to our next generation ATG technology, we rely on several single source providers to provide equipment, such as the antenna and modem. If we were required to for any reason, we estimate it could take up to two years to replace certain equipment suppliers. Delays in finding and contracting with alternative suppliers would significantly delay or suspend our ability to develop and deploy our next generation ATG service to airline partners and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to our Ku satellite service, we rely on several single source providers to provide the equipment, including the radome, antenna and modem. With respect to 2Ku, we rely on single source suppliers to provide the antenna and both the current and next generation modem required to operate the system, and such providers own some of the associated intellectual property. If required for any reason (including termination of the contract by the supplier or termination by us as a result of the supplier\u2019s failure to perform as required), we estimate that it could take up to two years to replace certain equipment suppliers. Delays in finding and contracting with alternative suppliers would significantly delay or suspend our ability to provide our satellite service to airline partners and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to our next generation ATG technology, we rely on several single source providers to provide the equipment, including the radome, antenna and modem. If we were required for any reason, we estimate it could take up to two years to replace certain equipment suppliers. Delays in finding and contracting with alternative suppliers would significantly delay or suspend our ability to develop and deploy our next generation ATG service to airline partners and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are required to find one or more alternative suppliers for any of these third-party provided components, we may not be able to contract with them on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to provide our service with our current or future airline partners. The lack of alternative suppliers could lead to higher prices and a failure by any of our single source providers to continue to produce the component, or to otherwise fulfill its obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We have faced, are currently facing and may face from time to time in the future, allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights.\nIf, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business and competitive position may be materially adversely affected. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. In addition, there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not exhaustively searched patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others.\nAny infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with our airline partners and certain BA customers, we have agreed to indemnify our airline partners and such customers against such claims and lawsuits, and, in some cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations, which, in addition to obligating us to pay defense costs, could result in significant indemnification obligations in the event of an adverse ruling in such an action. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology. As a result, we may be liable in the event of such claims. Any of these events could result in increases in operating expenses, limit our service offerings or result in a loss of business if we are unable to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline partners terminate or fail to renew their contracts.\nWe or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, airlines and other aircraft operators.\nThe market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in customer, airline and aircraft operator needs and frequent new service and product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue to enhance or develop new technology and services, including operational requirements of commercial airlines and business aircraft owners and operators and applications that meet customer needs and enhance operational efficiency on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements and/or industry standards, our service offerings may fail to meet customer, airline and aircraft operator needs or regulatory requirements. We may have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nFurthermore, the proliferation of new mobile devices, including tablets, and operating platforms poses challenges for our research and development efforts. If we are unable to create, or obtain rights to, simple solutions for a particular device or operating platform, we will be unable to effectively attract users of these devices or operating platforms and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, airline partners, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as \u201cGogo\u201d and \u201cGogo Vision\u201d and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we may do business in the future, including China and India. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions.\nThere can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective, that any pending or future patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed and, as a result, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nOur use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology.\nOpen source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open source software was linked to in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service.\nOur products contain complex systems and components that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such events could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. If our on-board equipment has a malfunction, or there is a problem with the equipment installation, which damages an airplane or impairs its\non-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. In particular, the passenger jets operated by our airline partners are very costly to repair and therefore the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify most of our airline partners for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes for such losses may include failure of our products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations would also be materially adversely affected should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect.\nThe software underlying our services is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when the software is first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our software, and defects or errors in our existing software may be detected in the future. Any defects or errors that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in:\n\u2022\ntermination or failure to renew contracts by our airline partners;\n\u2022\na reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our service;\n\u2022\nsales credits or refunds to our customers and airline partners;\n\u2022\nloss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development resources;\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation and brand image;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs; and\n\u2022\nclaims for substantial damages.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our software may be substantial and could harm our results of operations.\nRegulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services.\nWe are subject to various regulations, including those regulations promulgated by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies and comparable agencies outside the United States where we may do business. The two U.S. government agencies that have primary regulatory authority over our operations are the FCC and the FAA.\nThe FCC regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us and the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale and interconnection of wireless telecommunications systems. Any breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum license or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us.\nThe commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated in the United States by the FAA. FAA certification is required for all equipment we install on commercial aircraft and type certificated business aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification as a parts manufacturer. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Licenses and Regulation-Federal Aviation Administration,\u201d FAA approvals required to operate our business include Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) and Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA). Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining, or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business and, could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded, which therefore, could materially adversely affect our growth prospects, business and operating results. The FAA closely regulates many of our operations. If we fail to comply with the FAA\u2019s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, those new regulations or amendments to existing regulations generally increase our costs of compliance.\nWe are required to contribute a percentage of all revenue generated from interstate or international telecommunications services or interconnected VoIP services, which we offer in the BA segment to the federal Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. Broadband Internet access services are currently exempt from these USF contribution requirements, but the FCC is considering a number of reforms to its Universal Service Fund mechanisms that would expand the scope of that regulatory regime to such services. Such reforms may include, but are not limited to, imposing obligations on broadband Internet access service providers to contribute a percentage of the revenue earned from such services to the Universal Service Fund. To the extent the FCC adopts new contribution requirements that apply to broadband Internet providers or otherwise imposes additional contribution obligations, such requirements and obligations may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations.\nAs a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, or CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays related to meeting, or if we fail to comply with, any current or future CALEA, or similarly mandated law enforcement related, obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties, all of which could adversely affect our business. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations.\nIn addition to these U.S. agencies, we are also subject to regulation by foreign government agencies that choose to assert jurisdiction over us as a result of the service we provide on aircraft that fly international routes, including Industry Canada, which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Adverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business and could delay the roll-out of our services and have other adverse consequences for us. For example, a contract covering the international fleet of Delta Air Lines permits such airline to terminate its contract with us if we have not, by specified dates, obtained the FCC and foreign governmental regulatory approvals required to provide our Ku-band satellite service on aircraft flying such partner\u2019s international routes. Our ability to obtain certain regulatory approvals to\noffer the Gogo service internationally may also be the responsibility of a third party, and, therefore, may be out of our control. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business.\nIf government regulation of the Internet, including e-commerce or online video distribution changes, we may need to change the way we conduct our business to a manner that incurs greater operating expenses, which could harm our results of operations.\nThe current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. There may be additional regulatory uncertainty resulting from changes related to the November 2016 presidential election, such as new leadership in executive branch agencies and in the FCC. We cannot be certain that we, our vendors and media partners or our customers are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements in the countries in which our service is used. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business to comply with existing or future legal or regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the applicability of existing laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways.\nFor example, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services were previously classified as information services, and not as telecommunications services. Therefore, these services were not subject to FCC common carrier regulation. However, effective June 12, 2015, the FCC reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services (the \u201cOpen Internet Order\u201d). The Open Internet Order also adopted broad new net neutrality rules. For example, covered broadband providers may not block access to lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices. Broadband providers also may not impair, degrade or unreasonably interfere with lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices. In addition, broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind, and they may not prioritize the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contain an exception for \u201creasonable network management.\u201d The Open Internet Order recognizes that whether a network management practice is reasonable varies according to the broadband technology involved and may provide more flexibility to implement network management practices in the context of Gogo\u2019s capacity-constrained air-to-ground and satellite broadband networks. The FCC could disagree with our interpretation of the various Open Internet Order requirements, including the extent to which the rules may apply to services offered by our BA segment.\nThe FCC order also imposes new disclosure requirements on broadband providers, including enhanced network performance reporting requirements. The FCC temporarily exempted smaller providers, such as Gogo, from its enhanced disclosure requirements. The exemption was recently extended until February 2022.\nOther jurisdictions may adopt similar or different regulations that could affect our ability to use \u201cnetwork management\u201d techniques. Likewise, the United States and the European Union, among other jurisdictions, have adopted proposals regarding data protection that could impose heightened restrictions on certain of Gogo\u2019s activities relating to the collection and use of data of end users. On October 27, 2016, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules for broadband Internet access service and voice providers. The new rules govern, among other things, the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information and customer proprietary information, notice and consent practices, cybersecurity and data breach notifications. A portion of the privacy rules became effective on January 3, 2017. Other portions of the new rules are scheduled to become effective later this year. See also \u201cLicenses and Regulations-Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations.\u201d On April 27, 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), scheduled to take effect on May 25, 2018, which may result in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. Further, as we promote exclusive content and services and increase targeted advertising with our media partners to customers of the Gogo service, we may attract increased regulatory scrutiny.\nWe cannot be certain what positions regulators may take regarding our compliance with, or lack of compliance with, current and future legal and regulatory requirements or what positions regulators may take regarding any past or future actions we have taken or may take in any jurisdiction. Regulators may determine that we are not in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and impose penalties, or we may need to make changes to the Gogo platform, which could be costly and difficult. Any of these events would adversely affect our operating results and business.\nThe satellites that we currently rely on or may rely on in the future have minimum design lives, but could fail or suffer reduced capacity before then.\nThe usefulness of the satellites upon which we currently rely and may rely on in the future is limited by each satellite\u2019s minimum design life. For example, the satellites through which we provide Ku-band service have minimum design lives ranging from 10 to 15 years. Our ability to offer in-flight connectivity outside North America and alleviate capacity constraints throughout our network depends on the continued operation of the satellites or any replacement satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual operational lives of those or future satellites, which may be shorter than their design lives, nor can we provide assurance that replacement satellites will be developed, authorized or successfully deployed.\nIn the event of a failure or loss of any of these satellites, our satellite service providers may relocate another satellite and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a relocation may require regulatory approval, including through, among other things, a showing that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be certain that our satellite service providers could obtain such regulatory approval. In addition, we cannot guarantee that another satellite will be available for use as a replacement for a failed or lost satellite, or that such relocation can be accomplished without disrupting or otherwise adversely impacting our business.\nSatellites that are not yet in service are subject to construction and launch related risks.\nSatellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites and to obtain other launch opportunities. Construction and launch delays, including any delay in the launch of satellites intended to replace one of the satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf our efforts to retain and attract customers are not successful, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nWe currently generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of services, some of which are on a subscription basis, and equipment. We must continue to retain existing subscribers and attract new and repeat customers. If we are unable to effectively retain existing subscribers and attract new and repeat customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nUnreliable service levels, lack of sufficient capacity, uncompetitive pricing, lack of availability, security risk and lack of related features of our equipment and services are some of the factors that may adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers and partners and attract new and repeat customers. In our CA business, if consumers are able to satisfy their in-flight entertainment needs through activities other than broadband Internet access, at no or lower cost, they may not perceive value in our products and services. If our efforts to satisfy and retain our existing customers and subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to continue to attract new customers through word-of-mouth referrals. Any of these factors could cause our customer growth rate to fall, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our contracts with airline partners from which we derive a majority of our CA business revenue allow for termination rights if the percentage of passengers using connectivity aboard their flights falls below certain thresholds.\nThe demand for in-flight broadband Internet access service may decrease or develop more slowly than we expect. We cannot predict with certainty the development of the U.S. or international in-flight broadband internet access market or the market acceptance for our products and services.\nOur future success depends upon growing demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services, which is inherently uncertain. We have invested significant resources towards the roll-out of new service offerings, which represent a substantial part of our growth strategy. We face the risk that the U.S. and international markets for in-flight broadband Internet access services may decrease or develop more slowly or differently than we currently expect, or that our services, including our new offerings, may not achieve widespread market acceptance. We may be unable to market and sell our services successfully and cost-effectively to a sufficiently large number of customers.\nOur business depends on the continued proliferation of Wi-Fi as a standard feature in mobile devices. The growth in demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services also depends in part on the continued and increased use of laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices and the rate of evolution of data-intensive applications on the mobile Internet. If Wi-Fi ceases to be a standard feature in mobile devices, if the rate of integration of Wi-Fi on mobile devices decreases or is slower than expected, or if the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices or development of related applications decreases or grows more slowly than anticipated, the market for our services may be substantially diminished.\nWe have incurred operating losses in every quarter since we launched the Gogo service and may continue to incur quarterly operating losses, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nWe have incurred operating losses in every quarter since we launched the Gogo service in August 2008, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue in the future to generate operating income. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on the continued roll-out of our technology roadmap and international expansion. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables and such initiatives may require additional funding. Such variables include, for our technology roadmap, the availability of and costs associated with development and deployment of our 2.4 GHz technology, the timely and successful installation of ATG-4 and 2Ku on our partners\u2019 aircraft, and the timing of the roll-out of other technologies in the future, as well as costs incurred to develop and implement changes to ground and airborne software and hardware, costs associated with subsidizing our airline partners\u2019 equipment purchases, including upgrades to ATG-4 or other contractually obligated upgrades to our connectivity services and, with respect to satellite technologies, the cost of obtaining satellite capacity. With respect to our international expansion, such variables may include, in addition to costs associated with satellite technology as discussed in the preceding sentence, costs incurred to modify our portal for international deployment, costs related to sales and marketing activities and administrative support functions, equipment subsidies to airlines and additional legal and regulatory expenses associated with operating in the international commercial aviation market, costs incurred to set up branch offices, subsidiaries or other entities required to do business in certain countries, costs incurred to set up physical foreign offices and employment related costs for individuals located in those countries. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and promote our brand internationally. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing to execute our business plan or new initiatives, which we may not be able to secure on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $455.8 million. However, we may require additional financing at some point in the future to fully execute our business plan, including our technology roadmap, international or domestic expansion plans or other changes. Our success may depend on our ability to raise such additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely\nbasis. The amount and timing of our capital needs will depend in part on the extent of deployment of the Gogo service, the rate of customer penetration, the adoption of our service by airline partners and other factors set forth above that could adversely affect our business. In addition, we recently announced development of our next generation ATG network, and we may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing. Conditions in the economy and the financial markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary additional capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is also limited by the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. As of December 31, 2016, after giving effect to the issuance of the $65 million of additional notes in January 2017, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries would have been able to incur approximately $9.0 million of additional indebtedness. See \u201c-Risks Related to our Indebtedness-We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\u201d If we cannot secure sufficient additional financing, we may be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate additional service deployment, operations and investments or employ internal cost savings measures.\nIncreased costs and other demands associated with our growth could impact our ability to achieve profitability over the long term and could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources.\nWe expect our costs to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results. We continue to experience growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed significant demands on our management, administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Anticipated future growth, including growth related to the broadening of our service offerings, the roll-out of the technology roadmap and other network enhancements and international expansion of our CA business, will require the outlay of significant operating and capital expenditures and will continue to place strains on our personnel, technology and infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to contain costs with respect to growth opportunities. To successfully manage the expected growth of our operations, on a timely and cost-effective basis we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. In addition, as we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in legislation, regulation and government policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future.\nThe recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could significantly impact our business and the airline industry. Legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during the campaign and after the election could have a material impact on us, such as tax proposals that would generally make net interest expense on debt non-deductible to borrowers and increase the cost of importing (possibly including via lease) property. We are currently unable to predict whether reform discussions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to our business and the airline industry. In addition, the regulatory and business environments in foreign countries in which we, our customers and our equipment suppliers operate, may be affected by actual or perceived changes in U.S. legislation, regulation and policy, and may in turn affect our business. To the extent that domestic or foreign changes resulting from the 2016 elections have a negative impact on us or our airline partners and equipment suppliers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMacro-economic challenges are capable of creating volatile and unpredictable environments for doing business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the airline industry. For many travelers, air travel and spending on in-flight Internet access are discretionary purchases that they can eliminate in difficult economic times. Additionally, a weaker business environment may lead to a decrease in overall business travel, which has historically been an important contributor to our Gogo service revenue. In addition, continued deteriorating conditions may place market or political pressure on the customers that are served by our BA segment to cut costs including by reducing use of private aircraft.\nThese conditions may make it more difficult or less likely for customers to purchase our equipment and services. If economic conditions in the United States or globally deteriorate further or do not show improvement, we may experience material adverse effects to our business, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate unpredictably and may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors, adversely affecting our stock price.\nWe operate in a highly dynamic industry and our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors, many of which are not within our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Further, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue, margin and operating results, and if we fail to match our expected results or the results expected by financial analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, due to generally lower demand for business travel during the summer months and holiday periods, and leisure and other travel at other times during the year, our quarterly results may not be indicative of results for the full year. Due to these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as accurate indicators of our future performance.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of credit cards by users of our services present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of aircraft passengers and our employees and credit card information. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party telecommunications service providers, our customer support providers, our payment processors, and our other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information and credit card information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with airline partners, which generally require us to indemnify the airline for passenger and other third party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition,\nsuch incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. We could also be subject to certain state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also must comply with the FCC\u2019s privacy and data security rules. As noted above, on February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order which reclassified certain mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services. Following that order, the FCC conducted a separate rulemaking proceeding to update its CPNI rules, and on October 27, 2016, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules for certain broadband Internet access service providers and for voice providers, such as BA, which was already subject to the previous CPNI rules. The new rules govern, among other things, the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information and customer proprietary information, notice and consent practices, cybersecurity, and data breach notifications. A portion of the privacy rules became effective on January 3, 2017. Other portions of the new rules are scheduled to become effective later this year. See also \u201cBusiness-Licenses and Regulation-Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations.\u201d Our failure to comply with the FCC\u2019s new privacy and data security rules could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union, also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries\u2019 laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or sharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations may become more complex. On April 27, 2016, the European Union adopted the GDPR, scheduled to take effect on May 25, 2018, which may result in even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with other countries\u2019 privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, substantially all connectivity customers use credit cards to purchase our products and services. Problems with our or our vendors billing software could adversely affect our customer satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment services. If our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our subscribers\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by major credit card companies, to comply with their data security standards to protect payment card information. New and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs.\nWe depend upon third parties to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install our equipment.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our ATG and satellite telecommunication Wi-Fi services. The supply of third party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such\nsuppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. We also rely on a third party to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See also \u201c-We rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers for certain critical components of our networks and operations.\u201d\nIn our CA business, installation and maintenance of our airborne ATG and satellite equipment is performed by employees of third-party service providers with whom we contract, and, in a number of cases, our airline partners have the right to elect to have their own employees or a third-party service provider of their choice install our equipment directly. In our BA segment, installation of our equipment is performed by the OEMs or dealers who purchase our equipment. Having third parties or our customers install or maintain our equipment reduces our control over the processes, including timeliness and quality. If there is an equipment failure, including due to problems with the installation or maintenance processes, our reputation and our relationships with our customers could be harmed. The passenger jets operated by our airline partners are very costly to repair and therefore damages in any claims related to faulty installation or maintenance could be material. Additionally, we may be forced to pay significant remediation costs and/or penalties to airlines to cover equipment failure due to installation or maintenance problems and we may not be able to be indemnified for a portion or all of these costs.\nWe may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG and satellite networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. In particular, we may have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Michael Small, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nBusinesses or technologies we acquire could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may engage in acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our organic or internal growth. We do not have any meaningful experience with integrating and managing acquired businesses or assets. Acquisitions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Moreover, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail. Any future acquisition could involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nuse of cash to fund the acquisition or for unanticipated expenses;\n\u2022\nlimited market experience in new businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\nadditional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval;\n\u2022\nacquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\ncontrols in the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\ndilution to our current stockholders from the issuance of equity securities; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company.\nIn the event we enter into any acquisition agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust review, or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions.\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThe provision of equipment to our airline partners involves significant accounts receivable attributable to equipment receivables, which may not be settled on a timely basis. The large majority of our service revenue in our CA business is generated from credit card transactions and credit card accounts receivable are typically settled between one and three business days. Service and equipment revenues in our BA segment are directly billed to customers. Difficulties in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivables or longer payment cycles could lead to material fluctuations in our cash flows and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nExpenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters and class action lawsuits. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate a number of statutory schemes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation, which may subject us to litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascency of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs in these types of litigation may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or have other adverse effects on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require us to pay significant monetary damages. In addition, costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, prolonged litigation against any airline partner, customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential airline partners, customers and suppliers.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $886.9 million, including $525.0 million outstanding of our 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d) and $361.9 million outstanding of our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). On January 3, 2017, we issued an additional $65 million of Senior Secured Notes (the \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d), bringing our total Senior Secured Notes outstanding to $590.0 million. Subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding notes may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Since our IPO, we have obtained debt financing through our entry into the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility, issuance of Convertible Notes and issuance of Senior Secured Notes. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. As of December 31, 2016, and after giving effect to the issuance of the Additional Notes, the remaining permitted indebtedness for Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and its subsidiaries was approximately $9.0 million. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes does not prohibit Gogo Inc. from incurring additional indebtedness under any circumstances. However, the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes limits the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the Convertible Notes or to pay interest on indebtedness incurred, or dividends on preferred stock issued, by us to refinance, replace, renew or refund the Convertible Notes.\nThe terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could result in a default on existing indebtedness or future indebtedness.\nWe cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements and instruments governing our debt. In addition, we do not currently have a revolving credit facility under which we can borrow to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any indebtedness. In the absence of such sources of capital, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes restricts our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions or, if we do,\nwhat the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet our debt service obligations, including amounts under the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, when due.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries\u2019 unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes, to repay the Convertible Notes at maturity or to purchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes may limit our ability to pay interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance the Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share). Moreover, we will be required to repay the Convertible Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or repay the Convertible Notes at maturity or upon Convertible Notes being converted. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes also does not allow our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us for the payment of the principal of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes limits the amount of cash our subsidiaries may distribute to us to pay interest on the Convertible Notes or any interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance, replace, renew or refund the Convertible Notes, which may limit our ability to issue debt or other securities in an amount necessary to refinance the outstanding Convertible Notes or at rates that such distributions could support.\nOur failure to purchase Convertible Notes required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable upon future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness and the acceleration of amounts outstanding thereunder, including the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes could have serious consequences on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent.\nThe change of control repurchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively, in the event of a change of control. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes to require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase.\nThe Senior Secured Notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through February 6, 2017, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $7.86 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include:\n\u2022\nairline industry or general market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in technology or customer usage of Wi-Fi and Internet broadband services;\n\u2022\nany inability to timely and efficiently roll out 2Ku, 2.4 GHz or other components of our technology roadmap;\n\u2022\nany inability to sufficiently execute our international growth strategy;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain satellite service on commercially reasonable terms or at all, currently and in the future;\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants;\n\u2022\nfailure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nrenewal of our FCC license and our ability to obtain additional spectrum; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdjustments by holders of the Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAny buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity which we expect to occur involving our common stock.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transactions (the \u201cForward Transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions (the \u201cForward Counterparties\u201d). The Forward Transactions are generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparties and investors in the Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Forward Transactions is on or around March 1, 2020, the maturity date for the Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Forward Transactions, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Forward Transactions than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Forward Transactions. Such purchases or sales could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the Forward Counterparties (or their respective affiliates) are likely to modify their hedge positions in respect of the Forward Transactions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Forward Transactions (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Forward Transactions and on or around any election by a Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of its Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe Forward Counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Forward Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that Forward Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock.\nConversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes. Any sales in the\npublic market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation, settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and other equity incentives and the conversion of Convertible Notes. We may reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If securities or industry analysts covering Gogo downgrade our stock or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur significant stockholder could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Oakleigh Thorne and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (\u201cThorne Entities\u201d) beneficially own approximately 29% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, the Thorne Entities will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions, which may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe interests of the Thorne Entities may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director\u2019s interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nAs a public company, Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as Nasdaq rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to\ndevote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nWe are required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or the implementation of our financial system upgrade, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nAuthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nEstablishment of a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our board will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting;\n\u2022\nA requirement that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nA provision that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nA limitation on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nA prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nA requirement of supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Convertible Notes require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Convertible Notes to require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and growth of our business, and we do not expect to declare and pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, to the extent that we determine to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Furthermore, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nOur corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our board of directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens.\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, \u201c-If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license.\u201d Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that permit our board of directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock.\nThese restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex.\nWe are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have and will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.", "PERMNO": 13956, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GOGO"}
