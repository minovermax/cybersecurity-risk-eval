Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Sustained periods of low, or declines in, commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, cash flows, access to the capital markets and ability to grow.\nOur revenues, cash flows, profitability and future rate of growth substantially depend upon the market prices of oil and natural gas. Prices affect our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds under our Bank Credit Facility and through the capital markets. The amount available for borrowing under our Bank Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined by the lenders taking into account our estimated proved reserves and is subject to periodic redeterminations based on pricing models to be determined by the lenders at such time. Further, because we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations, we perform a ceiling test each quarter, which is impacted by declining prices. Significant price declines could cause us to take ceiling test write-downs, which would be reflected as non-cash charges against current earnings. See the Risk Factor entitled \u201cLower oil and natural gas prices and other factors in the future may result in ceiling test write-downs and other impairments of our asset carrying values\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition, significant or extended price declines may also adversely affect the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce. A reduction in production and/or the prices we receive for our production could result in a shortfall in our expected cash flows and require us to reduce our capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth.\nThe markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile historically and are likely to remain volatile in the future. For example, during the period January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, the daily NYMEX WTI crude oil price per Bbl ranged from a low of $(36.98) to a high of $85.64, and the daily NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price per MMBtu ranged from a low of $1.33 to a high of $23.86. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, NYMEX WTI crude oil and NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices recorded daily lows of $75.99 per Bbl and $3.73 per MMBtu, respectively.\nThe prices we receive for our oil and natural gas depend upon many factors beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u2022changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022market uncertainty;\n\u2022level of consumer product demands;\n\u2022hurricanes and other adverse climatic conditions;\n\u2022the impact of applicable market differentials, including those relating to quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional pricing;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental actions, regulations and taxes;\n\u2022price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in oil-producing countries, particularly those in the Middle East, Russia, South America and Africa;\n\u2022the occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u2022actions by OPEC Plus relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022U.S. and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022price and quantity of oil and natural gas imports and exports;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022localized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022capacity of processing, gathering, storage and transportation facilities;\n\u2022speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022overall domestic and foreign economic conditions.\nThese factors make it very difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices and are not long-term fixed price contracts. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Because oil, natural gas and NGLs accounted for approximately 67%, 24%, and 9%, respectively, of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, and approximately 69%, 23%, and 8%, respectively, of our 2021 production on an MBoe basis, our financial results are sensitive to movements in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.\nOur production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nOur production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. Unlike other entities that are geographically diversified, we may not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. Our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate, and result in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins. In addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico means that some or all of our properties could be affected should the region experience:\n\u2022severe weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse climatic conditions;\n\u2022delays or decreases in production or the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u2022delays or decreases in the availability or capacity to transport, gather or process production;\n\u2022changes in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace;\n\u2022extensive governmental regulation (including regulations that may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or require posting substantial bonds to address decommissioning and P&A costs) and interruption or termination of operations by governmental authorities based on environmental, safety or other considerations;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment such as the guidelines issued by the BOEM related to financial assurance requirements to cover decommissioning obligations for operations on the OCS; and/or\n\u2022changes imposed as a result of litigation or by a new Presidential Administration or by Congress in the United States that may result in added restrictions and delays or prohibitions in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including with respect to leasing, permitting, site development or operation in federal waters or hydraulic fracturing.\nBecause all or a number of our properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions may have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nProduction periods or reserve lives for U.S. Gulf of Mexico properties may subject us to higher reserve replacement needs and may impair our ability to reduce production during periods of low oil and natural gas prices.\nSubstantially all of our operations are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater than those of other oil and natural gas companies with longer-life reserves in other producing areas. Our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves at a unit cost that is sustainable at prevailing commodity prices.\nExploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain. We may not be able to economically find, develop or acquire additional reserves or make the necessary capital investments if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Our need to generate revenues to fund ongoing capital commitments or repay debt may limit our ability to slow or shut-in production from producing wells during periods of low prices for oil and natural gas. We cannot assure you that our future exploitation, exploration, development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs. Further, current market conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing to fund acquisitions, and further lower the level of activity and depressed values in the oil and natural gas property sales market.\nOur actual recovery of reserves may substantially differ from our proved reserve estimates.\nEstimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir and is therefore inherently imprecise. Additionally, our interpretations of the rules governing the estimation of proved reserves could differ from the interpretation of staff members of regulatory authorities resulting in estimates that could be challenged by these authorities.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that any present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves represents the market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves at December 31, 2021 on historical 12-month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Further, actual future net revenues are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022the amount and timing of capital expenditures and decommissioning costs;\n\u2022the rate and timing of production;\n\u2022changes in governmental legislation, regulations or taxation;\n\u2022volume, pricing and duration of our oil and natural gas hedging contracts;\n\u2022supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022our actual operating costs in producing oil and natural gas.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net revenues and cash flows may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 16% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and approximately 25% were non-producing. Any or all of our PUD or proved developed non-producing reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced. Furthermore, any or all of our undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves may not be ultimately produced during the time periods we plan or at the costs we budget, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves. Recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling or waterflood operations. Our reserve estimates include the assumptions that we incur capital expenditures to develop these undeveloped reserves and the actual costs and results associated with these properties may not be as estimated. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions materially affects the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur acreage has to be drilled before lease expirations in order to hold the acreage by production. If commodity prices become depressed for an extended period of time, it might not be economical for us to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage, which could result in the expiry of a portion of our acreage, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nUnless production is established as required by the leases covering the undeveloped acres, the leases for such acreage may expire.\nOur drilling plans for areas not held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On the acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling, and therefore there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those acreages.\nThe marketability of our production depends mostly upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.\nThe marketability of our production depends upon the availability, proximity, operation and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. The lack of availability or capacity of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. The disruption of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. Federal, state, and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas. If market factors change dramatically, the financial impact could be substantial. The availability of markets and the volatility of product prices are beyond our control and represent a significant risk.\nLower oil and natural gas prices and other factors in the future may result in ceiling test write-downs and other impairments of our asset carrying values.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the costs to acquire, explore for and develop oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method of accounting, our capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling based on the present value of future net revenues from proved reserves, computed using a discount factor of 10%, plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved oil and natural gas properties not being amortized less the related tax effects. A write-down of oil and natural gas properties does not impact cash flows from operating activities, but does reduce net income. The risk that we are required to write-down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our undeveloped property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. Volatility in commodity prices, poor conditions in the global economic markets and other factors could cause us to record additional write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and other assets in the future, and incur additional charges against future earnings. Any required write-downs or impairments could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to our operations in Mexico, our oil and natural gas properties are classified as unproved properties, not subject to amortization. The finalization of the unitization and unit operating agreement, which sets out the terms on which the reservoir will be jointly developed, and the outcome of the dispute with the Government of Mexico over decisions taken by SENER with respect to the Zama discovery, could adversely affect the value of the oil and natural gas assets and result in an impairment of our unevaluated oil and gas properties prior to reaching a final investment decision or of our evaluated properties upon reaching a final investment decision.\nIf we are forced to shut-in production, we will likely incur greater costs to bring the associated production back online, and will be unable to predict the production levels of such wells once brought back online.\nIf we are forced to shut-in production, we will likely incur greater costs to bring the associated production back online. Cost increases necessary to bring the associated wells back online may be significant enough that such wells would become uneconomic at low commodity price levels, which may lead to decreases in our proved reserve estimates and potential impairments and associated charges to our earnings. If we are able to bring wells back online, there is no assurance that such wells will be as productive following recommencement as they were prior to being shut-in. Any shut-in or curtailment of the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our fields could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, terrorist attacks and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we have various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, the implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls are sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nThe U.S. government has issued warnings that U.S. energy assets may be the future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments subject our operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack at our facilities, or those of our purchasers or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nEvents outside of our control, including an epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events that are outside of our control, and could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. The global or national outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, may cause disruptions to our business and operational plans, which may include (i) shortages of employees, (ii) unavailability of contractors or subcontractors, (iii) interruption of supplies from third parties upon which we rely, (iv) recommendations of, or restrictions imposed by government and health authorities, including quarantines, to address an outbreak and (v) restrictions that we and our contractors, subcontractors and our customers impose, including facility shutdowns, to ensure the safety of employees.\nIn addition, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding its global spread could negatively impact the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which could contribute to price volatility, impact the price we receive for oil and natural gas and materially and adversely affect the demand for and marketability of our production. The potential impact from COVID-19, both now and in the future, is difficult to predict, and the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. Any potential impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the COVID-19 infection rate or the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results.\nNew technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete, and we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages, and that may in the future, allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We rely heavily on the use of seismic technology to identify low-risk development and exploitation opportunities and to reduce our geological risk. Seismic technology or other technologies that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our non-operated properties.\nAs we carry out our drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. We may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties and their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners, and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others, could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors that could be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022risk of other non-operator\u2019s failure to pay its share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs;\n\u2022selection of technology;\n\u2022the rate of production of the reserves; and\n\u2022the timing and cost of P&A operations.\nIn addition, with respect to oil and natural gas projects that we do not operate, we have limited influence over operations, including limited control over the maintenance of safety and environmental standards. The operators of those properties may, depending on the terms of the applicable joint operating agreement:\n\u2022refuse to initiate exploration or development projects;\n\u2022initiate exploration or development projects on a slower or faster schedule than we would prefer;\n\u2022delay the pace of exploratory drilling or development; and/or\n\u2022drill more wells or build more facilities on a project than we can afford, whether on a cash basis or through financing, which may limit our participation in those projects or limit the percentage of our revenues from those projects.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated exploration and development activities.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil, natural gas and NGLs, we periodically enter into oil, natural gas and NGLs price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. These arrangements may include futures contracts on the NYMEX. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions, depending on the hedging instrument used, may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022our production is less than expected or is shut-in for extended periods due to hurricanes or other factors;\n\u2022there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point to be assumed in the hedge arrangement;\n\u2022the counterparties to our futures contracts fails to perform the contracts;\n\u2022a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices; or\n\u2022we are unable to market our production in a manner contemplated when entering into the hedge contract.\nOur outstanding commodity derivative instruments are with certain lenders or affiliates of the lenders under our Bank Credit Facility. Our derivative agreements with the lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the Bank Credit Facility. Future collateral requirements for our commodity hedging activities are uncertain and depend on the arrangements we negotiate with the counterparty and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and market conditions.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations as well as legal requirements applicable to marine mammals and endangered and threatened species.\nOur oil and natural gas operations in the United States and Mexico are subject to stringent federal, state and/or local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations require the acquisition of a permit or other approval before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within protected areas or that may affect certain wildlife, including marine species and endangered and threatened species and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Additionally, the threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries and the combat of climate change has been made a focal point of the Biden Administration's agenda. See Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Government Regulation - Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations for more discussion on environmental and worker safety matters. One or more of these developments that impact our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on the OCS could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditional drilling laws, regulations, executive orders and other regulatory initiatives that restrict, delay or prohibit oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities or access to locations where such activities may occur could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Biden Administration has taken a number of actions that may result in stricter environmental, health and safety standards applicable to our operations and those of the oil and gas industry more generally. The Biden Administration issued the \u201cExecutive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad\u201d on January 27, 2021 (the \u201cClimate Change Executive Order\u201d). This executive order directed the Secretary of the Interior to halt indefinitely new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a review by the Secretary of the Interior of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices in light of the Biden Administration\u2019s concerns regarding the impact of these activities on the environment and climate. The Secretary of the Interior completed its review of permitting and leasing practices in November 2021 and issued a report recommending, among other things, an increase in royalty rates and financial assurance requirements. However, litigation concerning the Climate Change Executive Order\u2019s pause on new oil and gas leases is ongoing. In June 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the Biden Administration from implementing the pause in new federal oil and gas leases. In November 2021, the Biden Administration conducted an offshore lease sale and various industry participants submitted bids for leases in the Gulf of Mexico; however, on January 27, 2022, in litigation brought by Friends of the Earth and other plaintiffs, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the November 2021 lease sale and the related agency decision making process, finding that the BOEM failed to consider the impact on foreign greenhouse gas emissions if the November 2021 lease sale was not held and the court determined that this failure was a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act. Following this decision by the District Court for the District of Columbia vacating the November 2021 lease sale, there is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the sale can be revived and whether the leases for which we were the apparent high bidder will be awarded. While the decision by the District Court for the District of Columbia has been appealed and a motion for expedited hearing has been filed, a decision from the appellate court may not be released until 2023 or beyond. In addition, there is increasing uncertainty regarding the near-term future of Gulf of Mexico lease sales. These lease sales are conducted pursuant to Five-Year Leasing Programs under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The current Five-Year Leasing Program is set to expire on June 30, 2022. No new Gulf of Mexico lease sales can be held after June 30, 2022, until a new Five-Year Leasing Program is approved, a process which, once begun, can take two to three years to complete. Consequently, it is uncertain whether a new Five-Year Leasing Program and subsequent lease sales will be conducted during the current Biden Administration. Additionally, any new Five-Year Leasing Program would likely be subject to heightened environmental review.\nOver the past decade, BSEE and BOEM, primarily under the Obama Administration, have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. While actions by BSEE or BOEM under the Trump Administration sought to mitigate or delay certain of those more rigorous standards, the Biden Administration could reconsider rules and regulatory initiatives implemented under the previous administration and replace them with more stringent requirements and also provide more rigorous enforcement of existing regulatory requirements. Compliance with any added or more stringent regulatory requirements or enforcement initiatives and existing environmental and spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response and decommissioning plans could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, governmental agencies under the Biden Administration may continue evaluating aspects of safety and operational performance in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico that may result in new, more restrictive requirements.\nThese regulatory actions, or any new laws, executive orders, regulations or other legal or enforcement initiatives, that impose increased costs or more stringent operational standards could delay or disrupt our operations, result in increased supplemental bonding and associated costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in suspension or cancellation of leases. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event may occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling and production operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations.\nSee Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Government Regulation - OCS Regulation for more discussion on orders and regulatory initiatives impacting the oil and natural gas industry on the OCS.\nWe may be unable to provide the financial assurances in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM if it submits future demands to cover our decommissioning obligations. If in the future the BOEM issues orders to provide additional financial assurances and we fail to comply with such future orders, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases.\nThe BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations or provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS. In 2016, the BOEM under the Obama Administration had sought to implement more stringent and costly standards under the existing federal financial assurance requirements through issuance and implementation of the 2016 NTL, but former President Trump\u2019s Administration first suspended, and then in 2020 rescinded, the implementation of this NTL. Consistent with recommendations made in a November 2021 DOI report on the federal oil and gas leasing program, the Biden Administration could pursue more stringent and financial assurance requirements that could increase our operating costs.\nFollowing the effectiveness of the 2016 NTL, we received orders from the BOEM in late 2016 directing us to provide additional financial assurance in material amounts relating to our OCS properties. We entered into discussions with the BOEM regarding the requested additional financial security and submitted a proposed tailored plan for the posting of additional financial security to the agency for review. However, as the Trump Administration rescinded the 2016 NTL, the BOEM has taken no action with respect to our previously submitted proposed tailored plan.\nThe BOEM, now under the Biden Administration, could in the future make new demands for additional financial assurances in material amounts relating to the decommissioning of our OCS properties. The BOEM may reject our proposals to satisfy any such additional financial assurance coverage and make demands that exceed our capabilities.\nIf we fail to comply with the current or future orders of the BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, suspending operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event that the BOEM issues a new NTL or proposes and finalizes new regulations similar to or more stringent than the 2016 NTL, the likely result could include the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which could in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, challenge the surety bond market\u2019s capacity for providing such additional financial assurance. Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the declining oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety companies may have about the priority of their lien on the operator\u2019s collateral. Moreover, a depressed oil price environment could result in sureties seeking additional collateral to support existing bonds, such as cash or letters of credit, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for future bonds to comply with supplemental bonding requirements of the BOEM. If we are required to provide collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit, our liquidity position could be negatively impacted and we may be required to seek alternative financing. To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing, we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures. All of these factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain the financial assurances required by the BOEM to conduct operations on the OCS. These and other changes to BOEM bonding and financial assurance requirements could result in increased costs on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to various international, foreign and U.S. federal, state and local governmental regulations that materially affect our operations.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to various international, foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions. Regulated matters include: permits for exploration, development and production operations; limitations on our drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas, such as marine habitats, and restrictions on the way we can discharge materials and/or GHG emissions into the environment; bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies, well P&A and other decommissioning costs; reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells and unitization and pooling of properties; regulations regarding the rate, terms and conditions of transportation service or the price, terms, and conditions related to the purchase and sale of oil and natural gas; and taxation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the issuance of remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain of our operations. In addition, because we hold federal leases, the federal government requires that we comply with numerous additional regulations applicable to government contractors.\nThe Ministry of Energy of Mexico has promulgated guidelines to establish procedures for conducting the unitization of shared reservoirs and approving the terms and conditions of unitization and unit operating agreements, as well as the authority to direct parties holding rights in a potentially shared reservoir to appraise and potentially form a unit for development of such reservoir.\nEven with the final regulations in place, there are still some uncertainties regarding the unitization process, specifically relating to Block 7 offshore Mexico. In July 2021, SENER designated PEMEX as operator of the Zama unit, just three days after SENER received a letter directly from PEMEX arguing for operatorship. Under Mexico\u2019s own unitization guidelines, SENER was required to \u201cconsider the principles of economy, competitiveness, efficiency, legality, transparency, best practices of industry and the best use of hydrocarbons.\u201d In September 2021, we submitted Notices of Dispute to the Government of Mexico relating to the decision taken by SENER. Our aim is to resolve the dispute amicably through consultations and negotiations to achieve a fair and mutually beneficial agreement; however, the outcome of these Notices of Dispute could be adverse to us and affect the value that we are able to recognize from the reservoir discovery.\nIn September 2015, we, together with our consortium partners executed a PSC with the CNH for each of Blocks 2 and 7 of Round 1. The PSCs require that the consortium execute a minimum work program expressed in work units during a four-year exploration period. Effective January 23, 2018, the activities already performed on Block 7 have satisfied the minimum work program on Block 7. Effective September 4, 2019, the activities already performed on Block 2 have satisfied the minimum work program on Block 2. Effective December 2, 2020, the activities already performed on Block 31 have satisfied the minimum work program on Block 31.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by political and economic circumstances in the countries in which we operate.\nOur oil and gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to political and economic uncertainties (including but not limited to changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in energy policies or the personnel administering them), expropriation of property, cancellation or modification of contract rights, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities, redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes, foreign exchange restrictions, currency fluctuations, royalty and tax increases and other risks arising out of governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, as well as risks of loss due to acts of terrorism, piracy, disease, illegal cartel activities and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties. Some of these risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our activities, namely, Mexico. Mexico\u2019s most recent presidential election was held in July 2018. Presidential reelection is not permitted in Mexico. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, took office on December 1, 2018, and his political party, Movimiento Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional has a majority in both houses of Mexico\u2019s congress. Mr. Lopez Obrador, and certain members of his cabinet have, in the past, made statements that would call into question the degree of support their administration will have for Mexico\u2019s energy reforms. However, at this time we cannot predict what changes (if any) will result from this change in administration. Political events in Mexico could adversely affect economic conditions and/or the oil and gas industry and, by extension, our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may experience significant shut-ins and losses of production due to the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico.\nOur production is primarily associated with our properties in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. Accordingly, if the level of production from these properties substantially declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue. We are particularly vulnerable to significant risk from hurricanes and tropical storms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We are unable to predict what impact future hurricanes and tropical storms might have on our future results of operations and production.\nWe are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We insure some, but not all, of our properties from operational loss-related events. We have insurance policies that include coverage for general liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of well, named U.S. Gulf of Mexico windstorm, oil pollution, construction all risk, workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability and other coverage. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that have to be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits or self-insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages or losses. See Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Insurance Matters for more information on our insurance coverage.\nAn operational or hurricane or other adverse weather-related event may cause damage or liability in excess of our coverage that might severely impact our financial position. We may be liable for damages from an event relating to a project in which we own a non-operating working interest. Such events may also cause a significant interruption to our business, which might also severely impact our financial position. We may experience production interruptions for which we do not have production interruption insurance.\nWe reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy limits and terms annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional PUD reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUD reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book additional PUD reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUD reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nOur actual production could differ materially from our forecasts.\nFrom time to time, we may provide forecasts of expected quantities of future oil and gas production. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production from existing wells. In addition, our forecasts may assume that none of the risks associated with our oil and natural gas operations summarized in this section would occur, such as facility or equipment malfunctions, adverse weather effects or significant declines in commodity prices or material increases in costs, which could make certain production uneconomical.\nOur operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities.\nOil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reserves are found. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain. To the extent we drill additional wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Deepwater and/or in the Gulf Coast deep shelf, our drilling activities increase capital cost. In addition, the geological complexity of the areas in which we have oil and natural gas operations make it more difficult for us to sustain the historical rates of drilling success. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022shortages in experienced labor; and\n\u2022shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.\nThe prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs, production equipment and related services. We cannot assure you that the wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable. Drilling activities can result in dry holes and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient cash flows to recoup drilling costs.\nOur industry experiences numerous operating risks.\nThe exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards. Environmental hazards include oil spills, gas leaks, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. We are also involved in completion operations that utilize hydraulic fracturing, which may potentially present additional operational and environmental risks. Additionally, our offshore operations are subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collisions and adverse weather and sea conditions, including the effects of hurricanes.\nIn addition, an oil spill on or related to our properties and operations could expose us to joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, under applicable law for containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we could be liable for costs and damages, which costs and damages could be material to our results of operations and financial position.\nOur business is also subject to the risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas that are beyond our control, including uncertainties as to the presence, size and recoverability of hydrocarbons. We may not encounter commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs. We may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. The presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and/or result in a total loss of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells.\nWe have an interest in Deepwater fields and may attempt to pursue additional operational activity in the future and acquire additional fields and leases in the Deepwaters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Exploration for oil or natural gas in the Deepwaters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico generally involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration in the shallower waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico conventional shelf. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. For example, the drilling of Deepwater wells requires specific types of drilling rigs with significantly higher day rates and limited availability as compared to the rigs used in shallower water. Deepwater wells often use subsea completion techniques with subsea trees tied back to host production facilities with flow lines. The installation of these subsea trees and flow lines requires substantial time and the use of advanced remote installation mechanics. These operations may encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in cost overruns. Furthermore, the Deepwater operations generally lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in the shallower waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico conventional shelf. As a result, a considerable amount of time may elapse between a Deepwater discovery and the marketing of the associated oil or natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of infrastructure, some reserve discoveries in the Deepwater may never be produced economically.\nIf any of these industry operating risks occur, we could have substantial losses. Substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of operations and production and repairs to resume operations. Any of these industry operating risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition within our industry may adversely affect our operations.\nCompetition within our industry is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We compete with major oil and gas companies and other independent producers of varying sizes, all of which are engaged in the acquisition of properties and the exploration and development of such properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than our budget, which may adversely affect our ability to compete. If other companies relocate to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region, levels of competition may increase and our business could be adversely affected. In the exploration and production business, some of the larger integrated companies may be better able than we are to respond to industry changes including price fluctuations, oil and gas demand, political change and government regulations.\nWe actively compete with other companies when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. These additional resources can be particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. The competitors may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and gas prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation. Competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. Further, our competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe impacts attaining success in the industry. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nThe loss of our larger customers could materially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited number of customers that provide a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of our larger customers, including Shell Trading (US) Company and Chevron Products Company, could adversely affect our current and future revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur industry has lost a significant number of experienced professionals over the years due to its cyclical nature, which is attributable, among other reasons, to the volatility in commodity prices. Our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel. We cannot assure you that individuals will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on us and our operations.\nIn addition, our exploration, production and decommissioning activities require personnel with specialized skills and experience. As a result, our ability to remain productive and profitable depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force, including geologists and geophysicists, field operations managers and engineers, to handle all aspects of our exploration, production and decommissioning activities. The demand for skilled workers in our industry is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico employees could result in a reduction of our labor force, increases in the wage rates that we will have to pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe have operations in multiple jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which the tax laws, their interpretation or their administration may change. As a result, our tax obligations and related filings are complex and subject to change, and our after-tax profitability could be lower than anticipated. Additionally, future tax legislative or regulatory changes in the United States, Mexico or any other jurisdiction in which we operate or have subsidiaries could result in changes to the taxation of our income and operations, which could also adversely impact our after-tax profitability.\nWe are subject to income, withholding and other taxes in the United States on a worldwide basis and in numerous state, local and foreign jurisdictions with respect to our income, operations and subsidiaries in those jurisdictions. Our after-tax profitability could be affected by numerous factors, including the availability of tax credits, exemptions, refunds (including refunds of value added taxes) and other benefits to reduce our tax liabilities, changes in the relative amount of our earnings subject to tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate or have subsidiaries, the potential expansion of our business into or otherwise becoming subject to tax in additional jurisdictions, changes to our existing business structure and operations, the extent of our intercompany transactions and the extent to which taxing authorities in the relevant jurisdictions respect those intercompany transactions.\nOur after-tax profitability may also be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws and tax rates, regulations, administrative practices and principles, judicial decisions, and interpretations, in each case, possibly with retroactive effect. In past years, federal and state level legislation in the United States has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. For example, President Biden has set forth several tax proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, an increase in the U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations (such as us) from 21%, and the elimination of tax subsidies for fossil fuels. The U.S. Congress could consider some or all of these proposals in connection with tax reform to be undertaken by the Biden Administration. Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation in 2021, which includes provisions that would, if ultimately enacted, impact the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations. Among other items, this legislation includes provisions that would impose a minimum tax on book income of certain corporations and an excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases that would be borne by the corporation repurchasing such stock. U.S. states in which we operate or own assets may also impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the \u201cMultilateral Instrument\u201d) has entered into force among the jurisdictions that have ratified it, although the United States has not yet become a signatory to the Multilateral Instrument. Such proposed legislative changes and ratification of the Multilateral Instrument in the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in further changes to our global taxation. Additionally, Mexico has enacted tax reform legislation, and a majority of the provisions became effective on January 1, 2020. These tax reforms provided for new and complex provisions that significantly change how Mexico tax entities and operations and are subject to further legislative change and administrative guidance and interpretation, which may differ from our interpretation. Future tax legislative or regulatory changes in the United States, Mexico or in any other jurisdictions in which we operate now or in the future could also adversely impact our after-tax profitability.\nA significant portion of our production, revenue and cash flow is concentrated in our Phoenix Field and our Pompano Field. Because of this concentration, any production problems, impacts of adverse weather or inaccuracies in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 22% and 15% of our production and 25% and 16% of our total revenue was attributable to our Phoenix Field and our Pompano Field, respectively, both of which are located in the federal waters offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This concentration in these fields means that any impact on our production from these fields, whether because of mechanical problems, adverse weather, well containment activities, changes in the regulatory environment or otherwise, could have a material effect on our business. We produce the Phoenix Field through the HP-I, a dynamically positioned floating production facility that is operated by Helix. The HP-I interconnects the Phoenix Field through a production buoy that can be disconnected if the HP-I cannot maintain its position on station, such as in the event of a mechanical problem with the dynamic positioning system or the approach of a hurricane. Because the HP-I may have to be disconnected from the Phoenix Field if circumstances require, our production from the Phoenix Field may be subject to more frequent interruptions than if the Phoenix Field was produced by a more conventional platform.\nWe are also required to disconnect and dry-dock the HP-I every two to three years for inspection as required by the United States Coast Guard, during which time we are unable to produce the Phoenix Field. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Helix dry-docked the HP-I. After conducting sea trials, production resumed in late March 2019, resulting in a total shut-in period of 57 days. The next dry-dock is scheduled for mid-2022 with an estimated shut-in lasting approximately 45 to 60 days.\nThe HP-I is part of the Helix Well Containment Group (\u201cHWCG\u201d), which is a consortium that is available to respond to any Deepwater well control event, such as the Macondo well oil spill. If such an event were to occur and the HWCG was to be utilized for well control, the HP-I, which is the vessel that would be used to respond to the Deepwater well control event, would be required to disconnect from the Phoenix Field until such time as the well control event was resolved and the HP-I could return to the Phoenix Field. During such time period, we would not be able to produce the Phoenix Field. In the event the HP-I has to disconnect from the Phoenix Field, our production, revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, all of our production from the Phoenix Field flows through the Green Canyon 19 connection facility operated by Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC. To the extent Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC temporarily shuts in its Green Canyon 19 connection facility, whether for maintenance or otherwise, we would not be able to produce the Phoenix Field during this period of time, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the actual reserves associated with the Phoenix Field are less than our estimated reserves, such a reduction of reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, all of our production from the Pompano Field flows through the Pompano Pipeline System operated by Crimson Gulf LLC. To the extent Crimson Gulf LLC temporarily shuts in the Pompano Pipeline System, whether for maintenance or otherwise, we would not be able to produce the Pompano Field during this period of time, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the actual reserves associated with the Pompano Field are less than our estimated reserves, such a reduction of reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Mexican operations are subject to certain offshore regulatory and environmental laws and regulations promulgated by Mexico.\nOur operations on oil and natural gas blocks in shallow waters off the coast of Mexico\u2019s Veracruz and Tabasco states and in other Mexican offshore areas where we are assessing other exploration opportunities, are subject to regulation by the SENER, the CNH and other Mexican regulatory bodies. The laws and regulations governing activities in the Mexican energy sector have undergone significant reformation over the past decade, and the legal regulatory framework continues to evolve as SENER, the CNH and other Mexican regulatory bodies issue new regulations and guidance. Such regulations are subject to change, and it is possible that SENER, the CNH or other Mexican regulatory bodies may impose new or revised requirements that could increase our operating costs and/or capital expenditures for operations in Mexican offshore waters. See Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Government Regulation - Regulation in Shallow Waters Off the Coast of Mexico and Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Government Regulation - Hydrocarbon Export Regulation in Mexico for additional disclosure relating to the legal requirements imposed by SENER, CNH or other Mexican regulatory bodies to which we may be subject in the pursuit of our operations.\nIn addition, our operations on oil and natural gas blocks in shallow waters off the coast of Mexico\u2019s Veracruz and Tabasco states and in other Mexican offshore areas where we are assessing other exploration opportunities, are subject to regulation by the ASEA. The laws and regulations governing the protection of health, safety and the environment from activities in the Mexican energy sector are also relatively new, having been significantly reformed in 2013 and 2014, and the legal regulatory framework continues to evolve as ASEA and other Mexican regulatory bodies issue new regulations and guidance. Such regulations are subject to change, and it is possible that ASEA or other Mexican regulatory bodies may impose new or revised requirements that could increase our operating costs and/or capital expenditures for operations in Mexican offshore waters. See Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations - Environmental Regulation in Shallow Waters Off the Coast of Mexico for additional disclosure relating to the legal requirements imposed by ASEA or other Mexican regulatory bodies to which we may be subject in the pursuit of our operations. The permit holders must comply with requirements relating to insurance, facility construction and design, law compliance, and risk analysis scenarios.\nUnder the PSCs, we are also jointly and severally liable for the performance of all obligations under the PSCs, including exploration, appraisal, extraction and abandonment activities and compliance with all environmental regulations, and failure to perform such obligations could result in contractual rescission of the PSCs.\nThree-dimensional seismic interpretation does not guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or if present, produce in economic quantities.\nWe rely on 3D seismic studies to assist us with assessing prospective drilling opportunities on our properties, as well as on properties that we may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or, if present, produce in economic quantities, and seismic indications of hydrocarbon saturation are generally not reliable indicators of productive reservoir rock. These limitations of 3D seismic data may impact our drilling and operational results, and consequently our financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d).\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We may do business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations or private entities. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees and consultants may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nUnder the PSCs with the CNH, we work as a consortium with our partners. Violations of the FCPA, by any consortium partner, may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the CNH has the authority to rescind the PSCs if these violations occur.\nOur business depends on access to oil and natural gas processing, gathering and transportation systems and facilities.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the operation, availability, proximity, capacity and expansion of processing, gathering and transportation facilities owned by third parties. We can provide no assurance that sufficient processing, gathering and/or transportation capacity exists or that we will be able to obtain sufficient processing, gathering and/or transportation capacity on economic terms. A lack of available capacity on processing, gathering and transportation facilities or delays in their planned expansions could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. A lack of availability of these facilities for an extended period of time could negatively impact our revenues. In addition, we enter into contracts for firm transportation, and any failure to renew those contracts on the same or better commercial terms could increase our costs and our exposure to the risks described above. In addition, the rates charged for processing, gathering and transportation services may increase over time.\nOur operations are subject to various risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur and reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, political and scientific attention. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been adopted at the federal level, but President Biden has indicated that action to address climate change is an important part of his administration\u2019s agenda. As a result, numerous executive actions and legislative and regulatory initiatives have been made or are likely to be considered by his administration and analogous legal actions are likely to be made or considered at the state, regional or international levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. These regulatory efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG emissions reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Additionally, the threat of climate change has resulted in increasing political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production of fossil fuels and emissions of GHG. Moreover, climate change activism calling for reduced access to capital, fuel conservation measures, governmental initiatives for renewable energy resources, increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices may create new competitive conditions that result in reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events. See Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations - Climate Change for additional disclosure relating to risks arising out of the threat of climate change.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce or eliminate future emissions of GHG could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce or eliminate future emissions of GHG could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, political, financial and litigation risks may result in our restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. Further, if any such effects of climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters may impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to climate change, societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer use of substitutes to oil and gas commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products and our services and the products and services of our customers, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for the hydrocarbon products we produce as well as additional governmental investigations and private litigation against us. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nMoreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.\nWe enhanced and re-named the Board of Directors\u2019 Safety Committee to become the Safety, Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee, which is the primary committee of our Board of Directors responsible for overseeing and managing our ESG initiatives. Committee members are expected to meet quarterly to review the implementation and effectiveness of our ESG programs and policies. Additionally, we have set the following aspirational goals to help strengthen our ESG performance: (i) a 30% reduction in GHG emissions intensity by 2025 with a stretch goal of 40%, as compared to our 2018 GHG emissions intensity baseline; and (ii) increased to 20% the ESG metrics component of our management\u2019s annual incentive plan, which includes key initiatives aimed at GHG emissions reduction and health and safety performance. We note, however, that despite our governance changes we may not be able to adequately identify or manage ESG-related risks and opportunities, which may include failing to achieve our GHG emission intensity reduction or other ESG-related aspirational goals, including but not limited to as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such goals. Additionally, to the extent we meet such targets, they may be achieved through various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate our ESG impact instead of actual changes in our ESG performance.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. We and other companies in our industry publish sustainability reports that are made available to investors. Such ratings and reports are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and/or our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, certain institutional lenders may decide not to provide funding to us based on ESG concerns, which could adversely affect our financial condition and access to capital for potential growth projects. To the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may also be unable to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, expanded federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC and the SEC have finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this is accomplished.\nIn one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on December 5, 2016, re-proposed rules imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including oil and gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the proposed rules on position limits, certain types of hedging transactions are exempt from these limits on the size of positions that may be held, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for certain enumerated \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also requires us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps to be entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for, and to utilize, the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps to be entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are fully implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we may encounter or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have implemented and continue to implement new regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become directly subject to such regulations and in any event the global derivatives market are affected to the extent that foreign counterparties are affected by such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nMedia coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. For example, in September 2021, we experienced negative publicity relating to an oil release in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Although we were a prior lessee of the block in question, had ceased production in the area in 2017 and had removed all pipeline infrastructure by 2019, the resulting publicity may have had a negative impact on us.\nSimilar or further such negative publicity in the future relating to U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations generally, or our operations specifically, may expose us to adverse consequences. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, growth prospects and stock price.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of our FERC-jurisdictional pipelines, tribal or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of such asset, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase or delay or increase the cost of expansion projects.\nWith respect to CKB Petroleum, Inc., which has been granted a waiver of certain portions of the ICA and related regulations by the FERC, should the pipeline\u2019s circumstances change, the FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that such pipeline no longer qualifies for a waiver. In the event that the FERC were to determine that CKB Petroleum, Inc. no longer qualified for a waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with the FERC, provide a cost justification for the transportation charge and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. Such a change in the jurisdictional status of transportation on the CKB Petroleum, Inc. pipeline could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to pursue our CCS business, either wholly or in significant measure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur CCS business strategy envisions the construction and operation of one or more CCS projects within the next two to three years, utilizing anthropogenic CO2 generated by industrial emitters along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast. CCS projects currently being actively evaluated include a Texas GLO carbon storage project located in Jefferson County, Texas, for which we were selected together with our partner Carbonvert Inc. by the agency in October 2021 as a winning bidder to pursue this project, and a commercial carbon storage venture entered into in November 2021 with Freeport LNG to be located along the Texas Gulf Coast adjacent to our co-venturer\u2019s LNG natural gas pre-treatment facilities near Freeport, Texas. In February 2022, we entered into a lease agreement along the Mississippi River Corridor in eastern Louisiana to develop a carbon capture, transportation and sequestration joint service along with EnLink Midstream, LLC. Our goal is that CCS projects, such as these three, will eventually enable us to offset some or all of our annual net CO2 emissions while delivering an economic return. However, the successful development of such projects is dependent on various economic, regulatory and operational factors, the failure of which to satisfy wholly or in significant measure any one or more of such factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe successful development of our CCS projects is dependent upon our ability to benefit from certain financial incentives available with respect to CCS projects. The U.S. Congress has incentivized the development of CCS projects through the establishment of the Section 45Q tax credit, which provides a tax credit for qualified CO2 that is captured using carbon capture equipment and that is disposed of in secure geological storage. Unless legislation is passed that allows for the direct cash payment of Section 45Q tax credits, our ability to benefit from Section 45Q tax credits is dependent upon us having a tax liability against which to utilize such credits or our ability to indirectly benefit from such credits through contractual arrangements with parties that are able to utilize such credits. Additionally, we will benefit from Section 45Q tax credits only if we own carbon capture equipment that captures qualified CO2 that we physically or contractually capture and securely store or if another party that owns carbon capture equipment elects to pass through Section 45Q tax credits to us and we dispose of the qualified CO2. While we intend to utilize Section 45Q tax credits in an economically beneficial manner, the market with respect to Section 45Q credits is developing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively benefit from such tax credits. Section 45Q tax credits are also subject to recapture with respect to any CO2 that ceases to be disposed of in secure storage, which recapture is treated as an increase in tax liability for the year in which the recapture occurs. The recapture period for Section 45Q tax credits is limited to a 3-year lookback period preceding the date that sequestered CO2 escapes from its secure storage.\nAdditionally, the Section 45Q tax credits may be reduced, modified or eliminated as a matter of legislative or regulatory policy. There can be no assurance that the tax credits under Section 45Q will not be reduced, modified, or eliminated in the future. Any such reduction, modification or elimination of Section 45Q tax credits, or our inability to enter into arrangements to utilize Section 45Q tax credits, could materially reduce our ability to develop CCS projects and, as a result, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to benefit from Section 45Q tax credits, we may determine that additional financial incentives are required for our CCS projects to be economical. If such additional incentives do not emerge, we may not be able to achieve an economic return from our CCS business or, alternatively, the construction or operation of our CCS projects may be substantially delayed, unprofitable or otherwise infeasible. Another emerging financial incentive for CCS projects may be the approximately $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Biden in November 2021, which includes a provision for approximately $2.5 billion to expand the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Carbon Storage Validation and Testing program to include large-scale commercialization of new or expanded carbon sequestration projects and CO2 transport infrastructure. However, the applicability of the financial incentives in the infrastructure bill to our projects is uncertain at this time and there is no assurance that we would qualify for such incentives in the pursuit of our CCS projects or that such credits would be adequate for our CCS project needs.\nAdditionally, successful development of CCS projects in the United States requires that we comply with what we anticipate will be a stringent regulatory scheme requiring that we obtain certain permits applicable to subsurface injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration. Moreover, as operator of our CCS projects, we must demonstrate and maintain levels of financial assurance sufficient to cover the cost of corrective action, injection well plugging, post injection site care and site closure, and emergency and remedial response. As CCS and carbon management represent an emerging sector, regulations may evolve rapidly, which could impact the feasibility of one or more of our anticipated projects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining permits or adequate levels of financial assurance for one or more of our CCS projects or that permits can be obtained on a timely basis, whether due to difficulty with the technical demonstrations required to obtain such permits, public opposition or otherwise. Separately, permitting CCS projects also requires obtaining a number of other permits and approvals unrelated to subsurface injection from various U.S. federal and state agencies, such as for air emissions or impacts to environmental, natural, historic or cultural resources resulting from the construction and operation of a CCS facility. To the extent regulatory requirements are imposed, are amended or more stringently enforced, we may incur additional costs in the pursuit of one or more of our CCS projects, which costs may be material or may render any one or more of our CCS projects uneconomical.\nDevelopment of successful CCS projects will also require satisfying certain operational factors, such as locating a suitable source of anthropogenic CO2 and reaching suitable agreements to capture that CO2. Such agreements are complex and may involve allocation of not only fees but also various credits, incentives and environmental attributes associated with the storage of CO2. Not all emission sources produce sufficiently large quantities of pure or relatively pure streams of CO2, or have installed equipment to capture such CO2, so as to be usable in one or more of our CCS projects. As a result, we cannot assure whether we will be able to procure sufficient quantities of CO2 on terms that are acceptable to us, and the failure to do so may have a material impact on our ability to execute our CCS strategy. Additionally, development of successful CCS projects will require infrastructure to transport CO2 between the source and our CCS sites. In project areas with existing CO2 transportation pipelines, this may require reaching an agreement on CO2 transportation with operators of CO2 pipelines within the regions in which we operate. Inability to reach a suitable agreement may render a project uneconomical or impracticable. Separately, if no CO2 pipelines exist in proposed project areas, or if existing pipelines do not extend to one or more of our project sites, we may be required to convert existing pipelines, or build new CO2 pipelines or lateral connections, which may be subject to various environmental and other permitting requirements as well as third party easements, which may render one or more projects uneconomical. We will also need to build the required equipment on a timely basis and at a cost that is economically viable. Additionally, complex recordkeeping and GHG emissions/sequestration accounting may be required in connection with one or more of our projects, which may increase the costs of such operations. Different methodologies may be required for various regulatory and non-regulatory accounts regarding GHG emissions/sequestration at one or more of our projects, including but not limited to, compliance with the EPA\u2019s mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Furthermore, as CCS may be viewed as a pathway to the continued use of fossil fuels, notwithstanding that CO2 emissions are intended to be captured, there may be organized opposition to CCS, including as it relates to our projects.\nIn consideration of the above matters, we anticipate, but can provide no assurance, that we will be able to execute upon our CCS business strategy in the future. Any failure by us to achieve such expectations in whole or any significant measure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure and Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur debt level and the covenants in our current or future agreements governing our debt, including our Bank Credit Facility and the indenture for our 12.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our debt impose significant restrictions on our ability to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including:\n\u2022incurring additional debt;\n\u2022paying dividends on stock, redeeming stock or redeeming subordinated debt;\n\u2022making investments;\n\u2022creating liens on our assets;\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022guaranteeing other indebtedness;\n\u2022entering into agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022merging, consolidating or transferring all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022hedging future production; and\n\u2022entering into transactions with affiliates.\nOur level of indebtedness, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, including the Bank Credit Facility and the indenture for our 12.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due January 2026 (the \u201c12.00% Notes\u201d) of Talos Production Inc. (the \u201cIssuer\u201d), have important consequences on our operations, including:\n\u2022requiring that we dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general business activities;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage against other less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates because debt under our Bank Credit Facility is at variable rates.\nWe may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of repayment of outstanding debt. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions. Sustained low oil and natural gas prices have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. Our cash flow is highly dependent on the prices we receive for oil and natural gas.\nWe depend on our Bank Credit Facility for a portion of our future capital needs. We are required to comply with certain debt covenants and certain financial ratios under the Bank Credit Facility. Our borrowing base under the Bank Credit Facility, which is redetermined semi-annually, is based on an amount established by the lenders after their evaluation of our proved oil and natural gas reserve values. If, due to a redetermination of our borrowing base, our outstanding borrowings plus outstanding letters of credit exceed our redetermined borrowing base (referred to as a borrowing base deficiency), we could be required to repay such borrowing base deficiency. Our Bank Credit Facility allows us to cure a borrowing base deficiency through any combination of the following actions: (i) repay amounts outstanding sufficient to cure the borrowing base deficiency within 30 days after the existence of such deficiency; (ii) add additional oil and gas properties acceptable to the banks to the borrowing base and take such actions necessary to grant the banks a mortgage in such oil and gas properties within 30 days after the existence of such deficiency; (iii) pay the deficiency in four equal monthly installments with the first installment due within 30 days after the existence of such deficiency or (iv) any combination of the above. We are required to elect one of the foregoing options within 10 days after the existence of such deficiency.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not repay our debt out of cash on hand, we could attempt to restructure or refinance such debt, reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to pay the interest on our debt or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets are available to pay or refinance such debt. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of our debt, including our Bank Credit Facility and the indenture for our 12.00% Notes, may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that affect our ability to raise cash through offerings of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offerings, refinancing or sale of assets. We cannot assure you that any such offerings, restructuring, refinancing or sale of assets would be successfully completed.\nA financial crisis may impact our business and financial condition and may adversely impact our ability to obtain funding under our Bank Credit Facility or in the capital markets.\nWe use our cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility to fund our capital expenditures, and we rely on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital for large or exceptional transactions. As such, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our Bank Credit Facility as a result of (i) a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a borrowing base redetermination or a breach or default under our Bank Credit Facility, including a breach of a financial covenant or (ii) an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations. We may also face limitations on our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets and complete asset sales, increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts and requirements by our contractual counterparties to post collateral guaranteeing performance.\nIn addition, from time to time, we could be required to, or we or our affiliates may seek to, retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other transactions. Such debt repurchase or exchange transactions, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Such transactions may give rise to taxable cancellation of indebtedness income (to the extent the fair market value of the property exchanged, or the amount of cash paid to acquire the outstanding debt, is less than the adjusted issue price of the outstanding debt) and adversely impact our ability to deduct interest expenses in respect of our debt against our taxable income in the future. This could result in a current or future tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows.\nWe require substantial capital expenditures to conduct our operations and replace our production, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms necessary to fund our planned capital expenditures.\nWe spend a substantial amount of capital for the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development, and production of oil and natural gas reserves. We fund our capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows, cash on hand and borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility, if necessary. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A further reduction in commodity prices may result in a further decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from our wells;\n\u2022the prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022our ability to borrow under our Bank Credit Facility.\nIf low oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, cause our revenues, cash flows from operating activities, and the borrowing base under our Bank Credit Facility to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to fund the capital necessary to complete our capital expenditure program. After utilizing our available sources of financing, we may be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such capital expenditures. We cannot be sure that additional debt or equity financing will be available, and we cannot be sure that cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to meet these requirements. For example, the ability of oil and gas companies to access the equity and high yield debt markets has been, and continues to be, significantly limited.\nWe are a holding company that has no material assets other than our ownership of the equity interests of Talos Production Inc. Accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from Talos Production Inc. to pay taxes, cover our corporate and other overhead expenses and pay dividends, if any, on our common stock.\nWe are a holding company that has no material assets other than our ownership of the equity interests of Talos Production Inc. We have no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Talos Production Inc. has available cash, we will cause Talos Production Inc. to make distributions of cash to us, directly and indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiaries, to pay taxes, cover our corporate and other overhead expenses and pay dividends, if any, on our common stock. As we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, we anticipate that any available cash, other than the cash distributed to us to pay taxes and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses, will be retained by Talos Production Inc. to satisfy its operational and other cash needs. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Although we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, if our board of directors decides to do so in the future, our ability to do so may be limited to the extent Talos Production Inc. is limited in its ability to make distributions to us, including the significant restrictions the agreements governing Talos Production Inc.\u2019s debt impose on the ability of Talos Production Inc. to make distributions and other payments to us. To the extent that we need funds and Talos Production Inc. is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing agreements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur estimates of future asset retirement obligations may vary significantly from period to period and unanticipated decommissioning costs could materially adversely affect our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe are required to record a liability for the discounted present value of our asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive, non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased or decreased costs. As a result, we may significantly increase or decrease our estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because we operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. The estimated costs to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimates of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane or other natural disaster. Also, a sustained lower commodity price environment may cause our non-operator partners to be unable to pay their share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs.\nWe have divested, as assignor, various leases, wells and facilities located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico where the purchasers, as assignees, typically assume all abandonment obligations acquired. Certain of these counterparties in these divestiture transactions or third parties in existing leases have filed for bankruptcy protection or undergone associated reorganizations and may not be able to perform required abandonment obligations. Under certain circumstances, regulations or federal laws such as the OCSLA could impose joint and several strict liability and require predecessor assignors, such as us, to assume such obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we have accrued $3.8 million and $20.6 million in obligations reflected as \u201cOther current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies for more information.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our future acquisitions, and we may be unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy will, in part, rely on acquisitions. We have to plan and manage acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. We expect to grow in the future by expanding the exploitation and development of our existing assets, in addition to growing through targeted acquisitions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or in other basins. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our future acquisitions, such as increased earnings, cost savings and revenue enhancements, for various reasons, including difficulties integrating operations and personnel, higher than expected acquisition and operating costs or other difficulties, inexperience with operating in new geographic regions, unknown liabilities, inaccurate reserve estimates and fluctuations in market prices.\nIn addition, integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks and unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. These difficulties include, among other things:\n\u2022operating a larger organization;\n\u2022coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022integrating corporate, technological and administrative functions;\n\u2022diverting management\u2019s attention from regular business concerns;\n\u2022diverting financial resources away from existing operations;\n\u2022increasing our indebtedness; and\n\u2022incurring potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nAny of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results. The process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which decreases the time they have to manage our business. If our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nOur future acquisitions could expose us to potentially significant liabilities, including P&A liabilities.\nWe expect that future acquisitions will contribute to our growth. In connection with potential future acquisitions, we may only be able to perform limited due diligence.\nSuccessful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities, including P&A liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and may not disclose all material issues or liabilities. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties. However, such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.\nThere may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We may be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we expect that we will generally acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and could potentially expose us to unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.\nResolution of litigation could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nResolution of litigation could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. To the extent that potential exposure to liability is not covered by insurance or insurance coverage is inadequate, we may incur losses that could be material to our financial position or results of operations in future periods.\nThe interests of the Riverstone Funds may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, entities controlled by or affiliated with Riverstone Energy Partners V, L.P. (\u201cRiverstone Funds\u201d) beneficially owned and possessed voting power over 24.7% of our common stock. Under the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, the Riverstone Funds may acquire additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our Independent Directors as defined in that certain Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2018 (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d).\nThrough the provisions set forth in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, the Riverstone Funds currently have the ability to designate certain members of our Board of Directors.\nThe Riverstone Funds also have significant influence over all other matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including changes in capital structure, transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law, and corporate governance, subject to the terms of the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement. The Riverstone Funds may have different interests than other holders of our common stock and may make decisions adverse to your interests.\nAmong other things, the Riverstone Funds\u2019 concentration of voting power could delay or defer a sale of us that many of our other stockholders support. This concentration of voting power could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire our common stock and, as a result, might harm the market price of our common stock.\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could enable others to benefit from corporate opportunities that might not otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested;\n\u2022permits the funds and other alternative investment vehicles managed by Apollo Management VII, L.P. and Apollo Commodities Management, L.P., with respect to Series I (\u201cApollo Funds\u201d), the Riverstone Funds, and any of our officers or directors who is also an officer, director, employee, managing director, or other affiliate of the Apollo Funds or the Riverstone Funds to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022provides that if the Apollo Funds, the Riverstone Funds, or any of our officers or directors who is also an officer, director, employee, managing director or other affiliate of the Apollo Funds or the Riverstone Funds becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as an director or officer of us), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to any other entity or individual and that director or officer will not be deemed to have acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary duty to us or our stockholders.\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of others.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees, agents or stockholders (including a beneficial owner of stock) to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants in the case. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides for concurrent federal and state court jurisdiction over actions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to a limited exception for certain \u201ccovered class actions\u201d as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Act and interpreted by the courts. Accordingly, we believe that the exclusive forum provision would apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except to the extent a particular action fell within the exception for covered class actions or the exception in the certificate of incorporation described above otherwise applied to such action, which could occur if, for example, the action also involved claims under the Exchange Act. Stockholders will not be deemed, by operation of Article 12 of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation alone, to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any share of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consent to these provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79444, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TALO"}
