{"cik": "1083301", "company": "IKONICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCovid-19 Related Risks\nA public health crisis or global outbreak of disease, including the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has had, and we believe will continue to have, a negative effect on the Company's operations, supply chain and workforce, creating business disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nThe pandemic caused by COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to all geographic regions where the Company\u2019s products are produced and sold. The global, regional and local spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant global mitigation measures, including government-directed quarantines, social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, travel restrictions and/or bans, and restricted access to certain corporate facilities and manufacturing sites. Uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the pandemic has contributed to periods of volatility and disruption of financial markets. While the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, impacts to the Company may include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the Company\u2019s stock price due to market volatility; a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products; reduced profitability; supply chain disruptions impeding the Company\u2019s ability to ship and/or receive product; potential interruptions or limitations to manufacturing operations imposed by local, state or federal governments; shortages of key raw materials; workforce absenteeism and distraction; labor shortages; customer credit concerns; cyber security and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements; reduced sources of liquidity; increased borrowing costs; and potential asset impairment charges. Business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company received funding and subsequently had its entire loan forgiven under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. There is no guarantee that the Company will not become subject to future penalties or that the decision to forgive the loan in whole or part will be rescinded.\nOn April 18, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note in favor of BMO Harris Bank evidencing an unsecured loan in the aggregate principal amount of $1,214,500, which was made pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP. The PPP was established under the CARES Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020, and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA. All the funds under the loan were disbursed to the Company on April 22, 2020. The Company used all proceeds from the loan to retain employees, maintain payroll and make rental and utility payments.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act, loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loans granted under the PPP. In 2020, the Company submitted an application for 100% forgiveness of the PPP Loan and upon approval by the SBA and the lender, the Company received forgiveness for 100% of the $1,214,500 loan. The Company is not aware of or anticipating any further review of its loan forgiveness, but the loan itself and the forgiveness of the loan could be subject for further examination by the SBA or the lender. If the decision to forgive the loan is reversed in part of whole, the Company will be required to repay the outstanding principal, along with accrued interest.\nStrategic and Competitive Related Risks\nThe Company\u2019s DTX and AMS initiatives involve new technologies that might not be executed successfully and might not achieve market acceptance.\nThe Company\u2019s DTX and AMS initiatives involve technologies that might never achieve market acceptance. During 2020 and 2019, the Company generated operating losses in its AMS segment while the DTX segment has realized operating income since 2015. The Company\u2019s ability for generating profits from these initiatives will depend on its products gaining market acceptance among customers, which cannot be guaranteed. The degree of market acceptance of any new products the Company develops will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to successfully develop its technologies and products to include the capabilities the Company intends;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s ability to accurately assess the functions and features customers desire;\n\u2022\nthe perceived effectiveness and price of the Company\u2019s products compared to alternative products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe development of new products and technologies by current competitors or new competitors that might enter the Company\u2019s markets; and\n\u2022\nthe strength of the Company\u2019s marketing and distribution functions.\nIf new products that the Company develops do not have the capabilities the Company expects or fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by customers for any reason, then the Company\u2019s AMS and DTX business units could fail to generate the revenues the Company expects and may not become profitable or sustain profitability.\nIf the Company\u2019s new products and technologies do not achieve market acceptance, the Company will not realize a return on its investments in its new business initiatives.\nThe Company has invested, and plans to continue to invest, significant resources in its research and development efforts to develop technology for its business units. The Company spent 5.0% of sales, or $671,000, on research and development in 2019 and 4.9% of sales, or $870,000, in 2019. A substantial portion of these investments was for new products and initiatives. The Company plans to continue to invest significant resources in research and development of new products and initiatives for the foreseeable future. The Company believes successful execution of these initiatives and new products is important for its ability to grow its revenues and profits. However, if the Company fails to generate its projected revenues from these products and initiatives, the Company\u2019s investments in these areas would not generate the profits the Company expects and its results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company faces significant competition and expects to face increasing competition in many aspects of its businesses, which could cause operating results to suffer.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments, changes in customer needs, and frequent product introductions and improvements, particularly with respect to the AMS and DTX businesses. If the Company is unable to anticipate and respond to these developments, its products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete. Most of the Company\u2019s competitors in the AMS and DTX fields are larger and better capitalized than the Company with longer operating histories. These advantages could allow the Company\u2019s competitors to invest more resources in research and development and sales and marketing than the Company, which could make the competitive products more attractive or better known to consumers than the Company\u2019s products. In addition, because there is potential for rapid technological change in fields in which the Company operates, the Company could face competition from new sources in the future that customers find more attractive.\nThe Company also could face increased competition in its traditional Chromaline and IKONICS Imaging units. Capital costs for machinery necessary to operate in these industries have decreased in recent years, increasing the possibility that the Company will face new competitors. An increase in the amount of competition the Company faces, or a loss of competitiveness in any of the Company\u2019s business units for any reason, could adversely affect its revenues and gross margins.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm its business and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing of the Company\u2019s products requires the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in:\n\u2022\nregulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities;\n\u2022\nsuspension of production;\n\u2022\nalteration of manufacturing processes; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the Company\u2019s operations or sales.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations also could require the Company to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs or incur other expenses.\nThird parties may claim the Company infringes their intellectual property rights, which could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may face claims that it infringes other parties\u2019 intellectual rights. Regardless of a claim\u2019s merit, claims that the Company\u2019s products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could cause the Company to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel. As a result of any intellectual property rights infringement claims, the Company could be required to:\n\u2022\npay infringement claims;\n\u2022\nstop manufacturing, using, or selling products or technology subject to infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndevelop other products or technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming, costly or impossible; or\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThese actions could harm the Company\u2019s competitive position, result in additional expenses, or require the Company to impair its assets. If the Company alters or stops production of affected items, its ability to generate revenue could be harmed.\nThe Company may be unable to enforce or protect its intellectual property rights, which may harm its ability to compete and may harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to enforce its patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights in various countries. If the Company seeks to enforce its rights, it could become subject to claims that its intellectual property rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to the opposing party. The Company\u2019s assertion of intellectual property rights also could result in the other party seeking to assert claims against the Company, which could harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s inability to enforce its intellectual property rights for any reason could harm its competitive position and business.\nIf the Company is unable to protect the confidentiality of its proprietary information and know-how, the value of its technology could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, the Company relies on unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. The Company generally seeks to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, the Company\u2019s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that the Company\u2019s employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the Company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nGeneral Economic and Operational Risks\nAdverse changes to global economic conditions generally, and to the aerospace and automotive industries in particular, may harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe prospects for economic growth in the United States and other countries remain uncertain and major economies where the Company conducts business could continue or return to recessionary conditions. Economic concerns and issues such as reduced access to capital for businesses or tariffs may cause the Company\u2019s customers to delay or reduce purchases of the Company\u2019s products. Given the continued uncertainty concerning the global economy, the Company also faces risks that may arise from financial difficulties experienced by suppliers and customers, such as an inability to collect receivables or the continued operation of suppliers. Global or local events, such as terrorist attacks, political insurgencies, electrical grid disruptions and outages, and pandemics including further spread of the coronavirus could also disrupt our operations, the operations of our suppliers and customers, or result in economic instability.\nThe Company\u2019s AMS segment focuses primarily on customers in the aerospace industry, and its DTX segment focuses primarily on customers in the automotive industry. The aerospace and automotive industries have experienced volatility in prior years in a manner similar to or greater than the global economy generally. If either or both these industries experiences difficulties that reduce demand for their products generally, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and prospects would suffer.\nThe Company conducts a global business that exposes it to additional risks.\nThe Company conducts business throughout the world, including in the United States, Europe, India and China. These international operations create a variety of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nrapid changes in government, economic and political policies and conditions, political or civil unrest or instability, terrorism or epidemics including the coronavirus;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with and changes in foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d);\n\u2022\ndifferent, complex and changing laws governing intellectual property rights, sometimes affording companies lesser protection in certain areas;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws, tariffs and business practices that favor local producers.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect the Company\u2019s international business and, consequently, its results of operations generally.\nThe Company faces risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales, including nearly all sales of its Chromaline products, were conducted through third parties. Using third parties for distribution exposes the Company to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with the Company\u2019s products, and the loss of a distributor could reduce the Company\u2019s revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm the Company\u2019s collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the FCPA or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business. Failing to manage risks related to the Company\u2019s use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken its competitive position.\nIncreases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nCertain raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a limited number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum-based. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials could require the Company to identify new supply sources, or reformulate and retest products or processes. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair the Company\u2019s ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers in a timely manner or at all, which could reduce its gross margins. Like most companies in the Company\u2019s industries, the Company does not have long-term supply contracts for most of its key raw materials, which exacerbates the foregoing risks to the Company.\nIf any of the Company\u2019s current single or limited source suppliers become unavailable or inadequate, its customer relationships, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company acquires certain of its materials that are critical to its operations from a limited number of third parties. Should any of the Company\u2019s current single or limited source suppliers become unavailable or inadequate, or impose terms unacceptable to the Company such as increased pricing terms, the Company could be required to spend a significant amount of time and expense to develop alternate sources of supply, and may not be successful in doing so on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to find a suitable supplier for a particular material, it could be required to modify its existing business processes or offerings to accommodate the situation. As a result, the loss of a single or limited source supplier could adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationship with its customers and its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on one manufacturer to make and sell DTX printers. If the manufacturer ceased to make or sell DTX printers, or failed to meet quality standards, the Company\u2019s financial results and prospects would be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on one company to manufacture and sell DTX printers. If the manufacturer ceased to produce or devote resources to selling DTX printers, due to a change in company strategy, to focus on alternative initiatives, or for any other reason, the Company would need to find an alternative manufacturer and seller of DTX printers. Finding an alternative manufacturer and seller of DTX printers could result in additional costs and delays in growing the Company\u2019s DTX business unit, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results and prospects.\nIn addition, if these manufacturers failed to produce DTX printers that satisfy the Company\u2019s quality standards, the Company\u2019s reputation with end users could be harmed and the Company could be forced to find a new manufacturer. Either of these results also would harm the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nThe inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSustaining and growing the Company\u2019s business depends on the recruitment, development and retention of qualified employees, including management and research and development personnel. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nWe heavily rely on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nThe Company relies on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions and manage its business, including maintaining employee, client and supplier information. The Company has also engaged third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. The information technology systems, as well as the systems of our customers, suppliers and other partners, are vulnerable to outages and an increasing risk of deliberate intrusions to gain access to and exploit company sensitive information. Similarly, data security breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to the Company's systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. The Company may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in its systems that could adversely affect results of operations and cause reputational harm.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and could vary due to a number of factors, some of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control. In addition, the Company\u2019s actual or projected operating results may fail to match its past performance. The Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including those listed below and those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022 the failure of the Company\u2019s new products to meet expectations;\n\u2022 changes to the costs of raw materials, especially petroleum-based materials;\n\u2022 the entry of new competitors into the Company\u2019s markets whether by established companies or by new companies;\n\u2022 the geographic distribution of the Company\u2019s sales;\n\u2022 changes in customer preferences or needs;\n\u2022 changes in the amount that the Company invests to develop or acquire new technologies;\n\u2022 delays between the Company\u2019s expenditures to develop new technologies and products and the generation of sales related thereto;\n\u2022 protectionist laws and tariffs implemented by foreign governments to favor local producers;\n\u2022 a prolonged United States Federal or State government shutdown;\n\u2022 changes in the Company\u2019s pricing policies or those of its competitors;\n\u2022 changes in accounting rules and tax and other laws; and\n\u2022 general economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand and product development trends.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year comparisons of the Company\u2019s operating results as an indicator of future performance.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for the Company\u2019s shares of common stock may not develop.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock has been listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market since 1999 and persistently has experienced limited trading volume. There can be no assurance that an active public market for the Company\u2019s shares will develop or be sustained. The lack of an active trading market could adversely affect the price and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and officers own a large percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock, which may allow them to collectively exert significant influence over substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s directors and officers collectively beneficially owned approximately 14.2% of its common stock outstanding as of that date. As a result, the Company\u2019s directors and officers could exert significant influence over all matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, amendments to the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, and extraordinary transactions such as mergers or going private transactions. These ownership positions may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control or a change in the composition of the Company\u2019s board of directors. In addition, substantial sales of shares beneficially owned by our directors or officers could be viewed negatively by third parties and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has, and could continue to, fluctuate substantially in a short period of time. The price of the Company\u2019s common stock could vary for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by the Company or its competitors, or the failure of the Company\u2019s new products to meet expectations;\n\u2022\nthe commencement of, or developments to, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results, which the Company has experienced in the past and expects to experience in the future;\n\u2022\nbusiness acquisitions or divestitures; or\n\u2022\nchanges to the global economy in general, and the aerospace and automotive markets in particular.\nIn addition, stock markets in general have experienced price and volume fluctuations in recent years, fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of the Company\u2019s shares may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance.", "PERMNO": 87759, "SIC": 2840, "TIC": "IKNX"}
