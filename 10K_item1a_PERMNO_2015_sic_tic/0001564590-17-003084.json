RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Any of the following risks and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results or operations. In such case, our ability to repay borrowed amounts when due may be impaired, and you may lose all or part of your original investment.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nExisting electric utility industry regulations, and changes to regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy systems that may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems or adversely impact the economics of existing energy contracts.\nFederal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, utility rate structures, interconnection procedures, internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities, heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies. These regulations and policies could deter potential customers from purchasing renewable energy, including solar energy systems. This could result in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems. For example, utilities commonly charge fees to large, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. These fees could increase our customers\u2019 cost to use our systems and make our product offerings less desirable, thereby harming our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, depending on the region, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most effectively with higher priced peak-hour electricity from the electric grid, rather than the lower average price of electricity. Modifications to the utilities\u2019 peak-hour pricing policies or other electricity rate designs, such as a lower volumetric rate, would require us to lower the price of our solar energy systems to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid.\nFuture changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies could also reduce our competitiveness, cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services, and threaten the economics of our existing energy contracts. For example, in October 2015, the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission capped the state\u2019s net metering program at existing levels and net energy metering no longer is available to new customers.\nIn other jurisdictions, it has been proposed that additional fees and other charges be assessed on customers purchasing energy from solar energy systems. In particular, the Salt River Project, or SRP, in Arizona has imposed anticompetitive penalties on new solar customers in an attempt to exclude rooftop solar, and in response in March 2015 we filed a lawsuit in federal court in Arizona, asking the court to stop SRP\u2019s anti-competitive behavior. In 2016, seventy one actions relating to fixed charges were taken by utilities around the country. In the event that effective net metering programs are limited in California, Arizona and other key markets or any such fees or charges are imposed, our ability to attract new customers and compete with the price of electricity generated by local utilities in these jurisdictions may be severely limited, and such unaccounted for increases in the fees or charges applicable to existing customer agreements may increase the cost of energy to those customers and result in an increased rate of defaults under our customer agreements. Any of these results could reduce demand for our solar energy systems, harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on net metering and related policies to offer competitive pricing to our customers in our key states.\nForty-one states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, available to new customers. Each of the states where we currently serve customers has adopted a net metering policy except for Texas, where certain individual utilities have adopted net metering or a policy similar to net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility\u2019s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of the electric load used by the customers. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Utilities operating in states without a net metering policy may receive solar electricity that is exported to the grid when there is no simultaneous energy demand by the customer without providing retail compensation to the customer for this generation.\nOur ability to sell solar energy systems and the electricity they generate may be adversely impacted by the failure to expand existing limits on the amount of net metering in states that have implemented it, the failure to adopt a net metering policy where it currently is not in place, the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately impact customers that utilize net metering or reductions in the amount or value of credit that customers receive through net metering. Our ability to sell solar energy systems and the electricity they generate may also be adversely impacted by the unavailability of expedited or simplified interconnection for grid-tied solar energy systems or any limitation on the number of customer interconnections or amount of solar energy that utilities are required to allow in their service territory or some part of the grid. In addition, utilities in some states, such as SRP in Arizona, imposed additional monthly charges on customers who interconnect solar energy systems installed on their homes. If such charges are imposed, the cost savings associated with switching to solar energy may be significantly reduced and our ability to attract future customers and compete with traditional utility providers could be impacted. If such charges are imposed on existing customers in a way that adversely impacts the economics of existing energy contracts, we could further see an increase in the default rate of existing energy contracts or we may find it necessary to renegotiate our pricing of affected customers.\nLimits on net metering, interconnection of solar energy systems and other operational policies in key markets could limit the number of solar energy systems installed in those markets. For example, in late December 2015, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (PUCN) effectively capped the state\u2019s net metering program at existing levels and net metering no longer was available to new customers. Subsequently, the PUCN modified portions of the new rules to be more favorable for solar customers, including providing grandfathering treatment for existing net metering customers and reopening a specified capacity of net metering for new customers in northern Nevada. However, at this time net metering still is not available to new customers in southern Nevada. If the caps on net metering in key markets are reached and not extended or if the amount or value of credit that customers receive for net metering is significantly reduced or eliminated, future customers will be unable to recognize the current cost savings associated with net metering and existing customers may not recognize the economic benefits that were available at the time their energy contracts were entered into. We rely substantially on net metering when we establish competitive pricing for our prospective customers and the absence of net metering for new customers could greatly limit demand for our solar energy systems.\nRegulatory limitations associated with technical considerations may significantly limit our ability to sell electricity from our solar energy systems in certain states.\nRegulatory limits associated with technical considerations may curb our growth in certain key states. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has promulgated small generator interconnection procedures that recommend limiting customer-sited intermittent generation resources, such as our solar energy systems, to a certain percentage of peak load on a given electrical feeder circuit. Similar limits have been adopted by various states and could constrain our ability to market to customers in certain geographic areas where the concentration of solar installations exceeds the limit. For example, Hawaiian electric utilities have adopted certain policies that limit distributed electricity generation in certain geographic areas. While these limits have constrained our growth in certain parts of Hawaii, policy developments in Hawaii generally have allowed distributed electricity generation penetration despite the electric utility-imposed limitations. Furthermore, in certain areas, we benefit from policies that allow for expedited or simplified procedures related to connecting solar energy systems to the power grid. If such procedures are changed or cease to be available, our ability to sell the electricity generated by solar energy systems we install may be adversely impacted. As adoption of solar distributed generation increases, along with the operation of large-scale solar generation in key markets such as California, the amount of solar energy being fed into the power grid may surpass the amount planned for relative to the amount of aggregate demand. Some utilities claim that within several years, solar generation resources may reach a level capable of causing an over-generation situation that could require some solar generation resources to be curtailed to maintain operation of the grid. The adverse effects of such curtailment without compensation could adversely impact our business, results of operations and future growth.\nOur business currently depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The expiration, elimination or reduction of these rebates, credits and incentives may adversely impact our business.\nU.S. federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and the exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. We rely on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to lower our cost of capital and to encourage fund investors to invest in our funds. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers for energy and for our solar energy systems. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.\nThe federal government currently offers a 30% investment tax credit under Section 48(a)(3) and Section 25D of the IRC, or the Federal ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities. Additionally, under Section 48, energy storage systems that are installed at the time of the solar power facility and, as required by IRS guidelines, store the energy of the solar power facility, are also eligible for the Federal ITC.\nThe credit under Section 48(a)(3) has been modified to remain at 30% of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by December 31, 2019, then decline to 26% for systems that commence construction by December 31, 2020 and to 22% for systems that commence construction by December 31, 2021. The credit is scheduled to decline to a permanent 10% effective January 1, 2022. Historically, we have utilized the Section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial leases and power purchase agreements, based on ownership of the solar energy system.\nThe credit under Section 25D has been modified to remain 30% of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by December 31 2019, then decline to 26% for systems placed in service by December 21, 2020, and to 22% for systems placed in service by December 31, 2021. The credit is scheduled to expire effective January 1, 2022. Loan product customers can currently claim the Section 25D investment tax credit. Customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash are also eligible to claim the Section 25D investment tax credit.\nReductions in, eliminations of, or expirations of, governmental incentives could adversely impact our results of operations and ability to compete in our industry by increasing our cost of capital, causing us to increase the prices of our energy and solar energy systems and reducing the size of our addressable market. In addition, this would adversely impact our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds and our ability to offer attractive financing to prospective customers.\nOur business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party owned solar energy systems.\nOur leases and power purchase agreements are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third-parties face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Other challenges pertain to whether third-party owned systems qualify for the same levels of rebates or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives and whether third-party owned systems are eligible for net metering and the associated significant cost savings. In some states and utility territories, third-parties that own solar energy systems are limited in the way that they may deliver solar energy to their customers. In jurisdictions such as Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power service territory, laws have been interpreted to prohibit the sale of electricity pursuant to our standard power purchase agreement. This has led us and other solar energy system providers that utilize third-party ownership arrangements to offer leases rather than power purchase agreements in such jurisdictions. Imposition of such limitations in additional jurisdictions or reductions in, or eliminations of, incentives for third-party owned systems could reduce demand for our systems, adversely impact our access to capital and cause us to increase the price we charge our customers for energy.\nWe need to enter into additional substantial financing arrangements to facilitate our customers\u2019 access to our solar energy systems, and if this financing is not available to us on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to grow our business would be materially adversely impacted.\nOur future success depends on our ability to raise capital from third-party fund investors to help finance the deployment of our residential and commercial solar energy systems. In particular, our strategy is to reduce the cost of capital through these arrangements to improve our margins, offset future reductions in government incentives and maintain the price competitiveness of our solar energy systems. If we are unable to establish new financing funds for third-party ownership arrangements when needed, or on desirable terms, to enable our customers\u2019 access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost, we may be unable to finance installation of our customers\u2019 systems, or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be significantly constrained, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have raised capital sufficient to finance installation of our customers\u2019 solar energy systems from a number of financial institutions and other large companies (including some that may be considered competitors to Tesla). In the past, challenges raising new funds have caused us to delay customer installations for brief periods of time.\nThe availability of this tax-advantaged financing depends upon many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe continued confidence of banks and other financing sources in the solar energy industry and the quality of our customer contracts;\n\u2022\nthe state of financial and credit markets, and the liquidity needs of banks and other financing sources;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential fund investors, each of which has limited funds and limited appetite for the tax benefits associated with these financings;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legal or tax risks associated with these financings;\n\u2022\nnon-renewal of government incentives or decreases in the associated benefits; and\n\u2022\nno adverse changes in the regulatory environment affecting the economics of our existing energy contracts.\nUnder current law, the Federal ITC will be reduced from 30% of the cost of solar energy systems to 26% of the cost of solar energy systems for systems that commence construction by December 31, 2020, and then reduced again to 22% of the cost of solar energy systems for systems that commence construction by December 31, 2021, until the Section 25D investment tax credit expires and the Section 48(a)(3) investment tax credit declines to a permanent 10% effective January 1, 2022.\nIn addition, U.S. Treasury grants are no longer available for new solar energy systems. Moreover, potential fund investors must remain satisfied that the structures we offer make the tax benefits associated with solar energy systems available to these investors, which depends both on the investors\u2019 assessment of the tax law and the absence of any unfavorable interpretations of that law. Changes in existing law and interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts could reduce the willingness of fund investors to invest in funds associated with these solar energy system investments. In addition, changes by state energy regulators impairing the economics of existing energy contracts causing an increased risk of default may also reduce the willingness of fund investors to invest. We cannot assure you that this type of financing will be available to us. If, for any reason, we are unable to finance\nsolar energy systems through tax-advantaged structures or if we are unable to realize or monetize depreciation benefits, we may no longer be able to provide solar energy systems to new customers on an economically viable basis. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSolar energy has yet to achieve broad market acceptance and depends on continued support in the form of performance-based incentives, rebates, tax credits and other incentives from federal, state, local and foreign governments. If this support diminishes, our ability to obtain external financing, on acceptable terms or otherwise, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to draw on financing commitments is subject to the conditions of the agreements underlying our financing funds, including the mix of types of energy contracts that we contribute and measures of customer credit. If we do not satisfy such conditions due to events related to our business or a specific financing fund, developments in our industry (including related to the Department of Treasury Inspector General investigation) or otherwise, and as a result we are unable to draw on existing commitments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and prospects. If any of the financial institutions or large companies that currently invest in our financing funds decide not to invest in future financing funds due to general market conditions, concerns about our business or prospects, the pendency of the Department of Treasury Inspector General investigation or any other reason, or materially change the terms under which they are willing to provide future financing, we may be unable to raise sufficient financing to engage in the third-party ownership arrangements that have fueled our growth to date.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt; other actions we are forced to take to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness may not be successful.\nOur total consolidated indebtedness was $3,580.4 million as of December 31, 2016, representing outstanding recourse indebtedness of $1,628.8 million and non-recourse indebtedness of $1,951.6 million.\nWhile our non-recourse credit facilities have been structured to be supported solely by the assets that are pledged as collateral, and, to date, we have not experienced any failure to pay such non-recourse indebtedness, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on such factors as:\n\u2022\nour future operational and financial performance;\n\u2022\nglobal economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions as to the amount of future cash flows to be produced by the solar assets subject to the non-recourse credit facilities;\n\u2022\nthe potential for widespread failure of solar energy systems and related components due to product defects;\n\u2022\nthe potential of widespread disasters for which our insurance coverage proves to be insufficient; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, regulations or policies that adversely affect the treatment of third-party owned solar energy systems.\nAs a result of these and other factors, our business may not be able to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. In addition, we may not fully achieve the full anticipated benefits and other cost reductions as a result of our acquisition by Tesla. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing our operations and operating expenses, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous.\nOur ability to refinance our existing indebtedness will depend on the financial markets and our financial condition at such time, and the occurrence of certain events and concerns regarding our business and liquidity, and general market conditions may make it difficult for us to access the financial markets or to refinance our existing indebtedness or raise additional funds on acceptable terms. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations or otherwise significantly limit our ability to respond to periods of increased liquidity pressure.\nWe expect to incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nA major part of our financial strategy is to monetize the customer payments and incentives associated with the deployment of solar energy systems under our third-party ownership arrangements through non-recourse borrowings against our interests to finance our operations. We and our subsidiaries expect to incur substantial additional non-recourse debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. Incurring such additional debt could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on existing indebtedness when due, and otherwise limiting our ability to respond to periods of increased liquidity pressure. Although certain of our existing credit facilities restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including recourse and secured indebtedness, we may be able to obtain amendments and waivers of such restrictions or may not be\nsubject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness. As the total amount of indebtedness we carry increases, we may be unable to enter into new credit facilities or refinance existing credit facilities and other indebtedness on acceptable terms, any such failure could constrain our liquidity and adversely impact our business, results of operations and future growth.\nWe may have trouble refinancing our existing indebtedness or obtaining new financing for our working capital, equipment financing and other needs in the future or complying with the terms of existing credit facilities. If credit facilities are not available to us on acceptable terms, if and when needed, or if we are unable to comply with their terms, our ability to respond to periods of constrained liquidity and to operate our business in accordance with current operating plans would be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had the ability to draw up to an additional $468.0 million under all of our credit facilities. Our secured revolving credit facility, our primary working capital facility, currently has a maximum size of $500 million (with $393.5 million currently committed from several lenders and an additional $106.5 million subject to further conditions) that matures in December 2017. The working capital facility requires us to comply with certain financial, reporting and other requirements. During the first and second quarters of 2016, the margins of our compliance with these financial covenants decreased, particularly with respect to the amount of unencumbered liquidity. While our lenders have given us waivers of certain covenants we have not satisfied in the past, there is no assurance that the lenders will waive or forbear from exercising their remedies with respect to any future defaults that might occur.\nIf we are unable to satisfy financial covenants and other terms under existing or new facilities, obtain associated waivers or forbearance from our lenders, or if we are unable to obtain refinancing or new financings for our working capital, equipment, convertible senior notes and other needs on acceptable terms if and when needed, our business would be adversely affected.\nAlthough our acquisition by Tesla in an all-stock transaction did not result in a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d we continue to be responsible for payments of interest during the term and may need to repay principal at maturity unless the stock price of Tesla significantly appreciates and the convertible senior notes are converted into Tesla common stock. We may need to refinance the convertible senior notes. Our failure to pay amounts when due or repurchase the convertible senior notes when required would constitute a default which could also result in defaults under other agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible senior notes.\nWe have incurred losses and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past, and we had an accumulated deficit of $77.9 million as of December 31, 2016. We may continue to incur net losses from operations if we are unable to fully achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition by Tesla, or if we increase our spending to finance any expansion of our operations, engage in additional product development activities (including solar-integrated roofing products) and implement internal systems and infrastructure to support our growth. We do not know whether our revenue will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs, and our limited operating history in many of these areas makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our operating results. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nsuccessful integration with Tesla;\n\u2022\ngrowing our customer base;\n\u2022\nincreasing the mix of cash sales and loans;\n\u2022\nfinding investors willing to invest in our financing funds;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and further lowering our cost of capital; and\n\u2022\nreducing the cost of components for our solar energy systems.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.\nThe Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Treasury has issued subpoenas to a number of significant participants in the solar energy installation industry, including us. The subpoena we received requires us to deliver certain documents in our possession relating to our participation in the U.S. Treasury grant program. These documents are being delivered to the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Treasury, which is investigating the administration and implementation of the U.S. Treasury grant program.\nIn July 2012, we and other companies that are significant participants in both the solar industry and the cash grant program under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of\nTreasury\u2019s Office of the Inspector General to deliver certain documents in our respective possession. In particular, our subpoena requested, among other things, documents dated, created, revised or referred to since January 1, 2007 that relate to our applications for U.S. Treasury grants or communications with certain other solar companies or certain firms that appraise solar energy property for U.S. Treasury grant application purposes. The Inspector General is working with the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the administration and implementation of the U.S. Treasury grant program, including possible misrepresentations concerning the fair market value of the solar power systems submitted for grant under that program made in grant applications by solar companies, including us. We intend to cooperate fully with the Inspector General and the Department of Justice and continue to produce information as requested by the Inspector General. We are unable to anticipate when the Inspector General will conclude its review. If, at the conclusion of the investigation, the Inspector General concludes that misrepresentations were made, the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us. If the Department of Justice were successful in asserting such an action, we could then be required to pay damages and penalties for any funds received based on such misrepresentations (which, in turn, could require us to make indemnity payments to certain of our fund investors). Such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, the period of time necessary to resolve the investigation is uncertain and this matter could require significant management and financial resources that could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department makes additional determinations that the fair market value of our solar energy systems is materially lower than what we have claimed, we may have to pay significant amounts to our financing funds or to our fund investors and such determinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe and our fund investors claim the Federal ITC or the U.S. Treasury grant in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar energy systems. We have obtained independent appraisals to support the fair market values we report for claiming Federal ITCs and U.S. Treasury grants. The Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department review these fair market values. With respect to U.S. Treasury grants, the U.S. Treasury Department reviews the reported fair market value in determining the amount initially awarded. The Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department may subsequently audit the fair market value and determine that amounts previously awarded must be repaid to the U.S. Treasury Department or that excess awards constitute taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A small number of our financing funds are undergoing such audits. With respect to Federal ITCs, the Internal Revenue Service may review the fair market value on audit and determine that the tax credits previously claimed must be reduced. If the fair market value is determined to be less than we reported, we may owe our financing fund or fund investors an amount equal to this difference, plus any costs and expenses associated with a challenge to that valuation. We could also be subject to tax liabilities, including interest and penalties.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has previously determined to award U.S. Treasury grants for some of our solar energy systems at a materially lower value than we had established in our appraisals. As a result, we have been required to pay our fund investors a true-up payment or contribute additional assets to the associated financing funds. It is possible that the U.S. Treasury Department will make similar determinations in the future. In response to such shortfalls, two of our financing funds filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of Federal Claims to recover the difference between the U.S. Treasury grants they sought and the amounts the U.S. Treasury paid; to the extent that these lawsuits are successful, any recovery would be used to repay us for amounts we previously reimbursed those funds. Our fund investors have contributed to our financing funds at the amounts the U.S. Treasury Department most recently awarded on similarly situated energy systems in order to reduce or eliminate the need for us to subsequently pay those fund investors true-up payments or contribute additional assets to the associated financing funds.\nThe Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department may object to the fair market value of solar energy systems that we have constructed, or will construct, including any systems for which grants have already been paid, as a result of:\n\u2022\nany pending or future audit,\n\u2022\nthe outcome of the Department of Treasury Inspector General investigation, or\n\u2022\nchanges in guidelines or otherwise.\nIf the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. For example, a hypothetical 5% downward adjustment in the fair market value of the $501.2 million of U.S. Department of Treasury grant applications that have been awarded from the beginning of the U.S. Treasury grant program through December 31, 2016 would obligate us to repay up to $25.1 million to our fund investors.\nWe have historically benefited from the declining cost of solar panels and other system components, and our business and financial results may be harmed as a result of increases in costs or tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on imported solar panels and other system components.\nThe declining cost of solar panels and the raw materials necessary to manufacture them has been a key driver in the pricing of our solar energy systems and customer adoption of this form of renewable energy. In the event of a significant increase of solar panel and raw materials prices, our ability to compete and our financial results could suffer. Further, the cost of solar panels and raw materials could potentially increase in the future due to a variety of factors which we cannot control, including the imposition of duties, subsidies and/or safeguards or other trade-related costs or penalties or shortages of essential components. Currently, global production of solar panels is at a point of oversupply, and prices are continuing to decline. As we increase our solar panel manufacturing operations (including our manufacturing relationship with Panasonic and our solar-integrated roofing products), future price declines may harm our ability to compete and produce solar panels at prices equal to or less than our competitors.\nThe U.S. government imposes antidumping and countervailing duties on solar cells manufactured in China and/or Taiwan. Based on determinations by the U.S. government, the antidumping and countervailing duty rates range from approximately 33%-255%. Such antidumping and countervailing duties are subject to annual review and may be increased or decreased.\nIn addition, the U.S. government imposed additional tariffs on solar modules manufactured in China (with solar cells manufactured in other countries) and solar cells manufactured in Taiwan. In early January 2015, the U.S. government announced its affirmative final determinations in both the countervailing duty and antidumping cases against China and in the antidumping case against Taiwan.\nSince these tariffs are reflected in the purchase price of the solar panels and cells, these tariffs are a cost associated with purchasing these solar products. In the past, we purchased a significant number of the solar panels used in our solar energy systems from manufacturers that were based in China. We continue to be affected by these tariffs/duties and any changes to them as many of the solar panels we currently purchase contain components, including solar cells, from China and Taiwan.\nIf additional tariffs are imposed or other negotiated outcomes occur, our ability to purchase these products on competitive terms or to access specialized technologies from countries like China and Taiwan could be limited. Further, foreign suppliers in other countries could also be the subject of these or future trade cases. Any of these events could harm our financial results by requiring us to account for the cost of trade penalties or to purchase and integrate solar panels or other system components from alternative and potentially higher-priced sources.\nIn September 2014, we acquired Silevo, a solar panel technology and manufacturing company with manufacturing operations in China. In May 2015, we were contacted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to provide information regarding our importation of solar panels from China. Based upon the information we provided, CBP agreed that our solar panels were not subject to the scope of antidumping and countervailing duty Orders on Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells/Modules from China (Orders); however, CBP instructed us to obtain a determination from the Department of Commerce (DOC). In June 2016, the DOC issued its final determination finding that Silevo\u2019s solar panels, manufactured in China, are within the scope of the antidumping and countervailing Orders. We are currently challenging that final determination in the Court of International Trade (CIT). However, until this issue is resolved, we have not and do not intend on importing Silevo solar panels produced in China for our U.S. operations without depositing the applicable antidumping and countervailing duties.\nA material drop in the retail price of utility-generated electricity or electricity from other sources would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that a customer\u2019s decision to buy renewable energy from us is primarily driven by their desire to pay less for electricity. The customer\u2019s decision may also be affected by the cost of other renewable energy sources. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utilities or other renewable energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could harm our business. The price of electricity from utilities could decrease as a result of:\n\u2022\nthe construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas or renewable energy technologies;\n\u2022\nthe construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines;\n\u2022\na reduction in the price of natural gas, including as a result of new drilling techniques or a relaxation of associated regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nthe development of energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption; and\n\u2022\nthe development of new renewable energy technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nA reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase of our solar energy systems or the purchase of energy under our lease and power purchase agreements less economically attractive. In addition, a shift in the timing of peak rates for utility-generated electricity to a time of day when solar energy generation is less efficient could make our solar energy system offerings less competitive and reduce demand for our products and services. If the retail price of energy available from utilities were to decrease for any reason, we would be at a competitive disadvantage. As a result of these or similar events impacting the economics of our customer agreements, we may be unable to attract new customers and we may experience an increased rate of defaults under our existing customer agreements.\nA material drop in the retail price of utility-generated electricity would particularly adversely impact our ability to attract commercial customers.\nCommercial customers comprise a significant and growing portion of our business, and the commercial market for energy is particularly sensitive to price changes. Typically, commercial customers pay less for energy from utilities than residential customers. Because the price we are able to charge commercial customers is only slightly lower than their current retail rate, any decline in the retail rate of energy for commercial entities could have a significant impact on our ability to attract commercial customers. We may be unable to offer solar energy systems in commercial markets that produce electricity at rates that are competitive with the unsubsidized price of retail electricity. If this were to occur, our business would be harmed because we would be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other energy providers and may be unable to attract new commercial customers.\nThe terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York, as amended, pertaining to the construction of the Buffalo Riverbend Manufacturing Facility, among other things, require us to comply with a number of covenants during the term of the agreement. Any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the Foundation and result in termination of the agreement.\nIn September 2014, Silevo entered into an amended and restated research and development alliance agreement, as amended from time to time, referred to as the Riverbend Agreement, with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York, referred to as the Foundation, for the construction of an approximately 1 million square foot manufacturing facility capable of producing 1-gigawatt of solar panels annually on an approximately 88.24 acre site located in Buffalo, New York, referred to as the Manufacturing Facility.\nUnder the terms of the Riverbend Agreement, the Foundation will construct the Manufacturing Facility and install certain utilities and other improvements, with participation by us as to the design and construction of the Manufacturing Facility, and acquire certain manufacturing equipment designated by us to be used in the Manufacturing Facility and other specified items. The Foundation will cover construction costs related to the Manufacturing Facility and certain manufacturing equipment, in each case up to a maximum funding allocation from the State of New York, as well as additional specified items, and we will be responsible for any construction and equipment costs in excess of such amounts. The Foundation will own the Manufacturing Facility and manufacturing equipment it acquires for the project. We are also responsible for the acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment, which equipment we will own. Following completion of the Manufacturing Facility, we will lease the Manufacturing Facility from the Foundation for an initial period of 10 years for $2 per year plus utilities, and the Foundation will grant us the right to use the manufacturing equipment owned by it during the initial lease term at no charge.\nIn addition to the other obligations under the Riverbend Agreement, we must (i) use our best commercially reasonable efforts to commission the manufacturing equipment within three months of Manufacturing Facility Completion and reach full production output within three months thereafter, (ii) employ personnel for at least 1,460 jobs in Buffalo, New York, with 500 of such jobs for the manufacturing operation at the Manufacturing Facility, for the initial two years of collaboration commencing after Manufacturing Facility Completion, and we have committed to the retention of these jobs for five years, (iii) employ at least 2,000 other personnel in the State of New York for five years after Manufacturing Facility Completion, (iv) employ a total of 5,000 people in the State of New York by the tenth anniversary of Manufacturing Facility Completion, (v) spend or incur approximately $5 billion in combined capital, operational expenses and other costs in the State of New York during the 10 year period following full production, (vi) make reasonable efforts to provide first consideration to New York-based suppliers, (vii) invest and spend in manufacturing operations at a level that ensures competitive product costs for at least five years from full production, and (viii) negotiate in good faith with the Foundation on an exclusive \u201cfirst opportunity basis\u201d for 120 days before entering into any agreement for additional solar panel manufacturing capacity that Silevo may wish to develop during the term of the agreement. If we are not able to hire the specified number of employees or identify and qualify local vendors and suppliers, we would face the risk of not only failing to meet the performance criteria under the Riverbend Agreement but also not being capable of running the operations related to the Manufacturing Facility. If we fail in any year over the course of the ten-year term to meet these specified investment and job creation obligations, as described above, we would be obligated to pay a \u201cprogram payment\u201d of $41.2 million to the Foundation in any such year. In addition, we are subject to other events of defaults, including breach of these program payments and certain insolvency events, that would lead to the acceleration of all of the then unpaid program payments by us to the Foundation. Our failure to meet our contractual obligations under the Riverbend Agreement may result in our obligation to pay significant amounts to the Foundation in scheduled program\npayments, other contractual damages and/or the termination of our lease of the Manufacturing Facility. Any inability on our part to raise the capital necessary to operate the Manufacturing Facility and meet the specified requirements of the Riverbend Agreement during the 10-year period following full production would also cause a material adverse effect upon our business operations and prospects.\nIn December 2016, we entered into agreements with Panasonic to manufacture solar cells and modules at the Manufacturing Facility. Our expectations as to the cost of building the Manufacturing Facility, acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing relationship with Panasonic and other operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits under the Riverbend Agreement. In the event of any cost overruns in construction, commissioning, acquiring manufacturing equipment or operating the Manufacturing Facility, we may incur additional capital and operating expenses that would have a material adverse effect upon our business operations and prospects.\nOur projections as to the time and expense necessary to build the Manufacturing Facility and acquire the manufacturing equipment may prove incorrect and subject us to significant delay and additional expense.\nWe currently anticipate commencing solar module and solar roof manufacturing in the second half of 2017 with photovoltaic cells sourced from Panasonic, and are working towards ramping production to 1 gigawatt of solar cell production by 2019. We are working with the State of New York to finalize orders of manufacturing equipment related to solar module production.\nWe have recently identified potential modifications to the manufacturing equipment and factory layout related to the solar cell manufacturing line that may offer the ability to increase the production capacity of the Manufacturing Facility above 1 gigawatt per year. We believe that the short delay in finalizing the overall configuration will help maintain the long-term competitiveness of the Manufacturing Facility. However, this is an aggressive schedule and we may experience additional delays.\nThere are a number of risks which may delay the completion of the Manufacturing Facility and commencement of operations, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in placing orders for necessary equipment with long lead times;\n\u2022\nfailure or delay in obtaining necessary permits, licenses or other governmental support or approvals;\n\u2022\nthe time necessary for the construction of related utility and infrastructure improvements;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering problems;\n\u2022\nthe inability to identify and hire qualified construction and other workers on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022\nconstruction delays and contractor performance shortfalls;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or labor disruptions, including efforts by our employees to enter into collective bargaining agreements;\n\u2022\navailability of raw materials and components from suppliers and any delivery delays in such materials or components;\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from environmental conditions, and any design changes or additions necessary to remediate prior environmental hazards at the site; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, such as an extreme winter, and natural disasters.\nAny delay in the completion of the Manufacturing Facility and commencement of our operations will result in us incurring additional expenses and could negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nRising interest rates could adversely impact our business.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing our cost of capital. For example:\n\u2022\nrising interest rates would increase our cost of capital; and\n\u2022\nrising interest rates may negatively impact our ability to secure financing on favorable terms to facilitate our customers\u2019 purchase of our solar energy systems or energy generated by our solar energy systems.\nThe majority of our cash flows to date have been from solar energy systems under lease and power purchase agreements that have been monetized under various financing fund and borrowing structures. One of the components of this monetization is the present value of the payment streams from our customers who enter into these leases and power purchase agreements. If the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates, it will reduce the present value of the customer payment stream and consequently reduce the total value that we are able to derive from monetizing the payment stream. Interest rates are at historically\nlow levels, partially as a result of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken actions to taper its intervention, and should these actions continue, it is likely that interest rates will rise, which could cause our cost of capital to increase and impede our ability to secure financing. As a result, our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition, we evaluate our business with a long-term view based on cash flows relating to our customer agreements, third-party financing funds and other arrangements. To date, we have taken limited actions to mitigate the risk of rising future interest rates. In 2014, we initiated a strategy of purchasing limited long-term derivative securities to economically hedge the effect of future interest rate increases. We may continue to engage in such transactions and the cost and outcomes of such transactions are currently not known.\nWe are expanding our international activities and customers, and plan to continue these efforts, which subject us to additional business risks, including compliance with international and trade regulations.\nOur long-term strategic plans include international expansion and we intend to sell our solar energy products and services in international markets. For example, in August 2015, we acquired S.A. de C.V., or Ilioss to expand our operations into Mexico.\nRisks inherent to our international operations include the following:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations, including energy regulations, export and import restrictions, tax laws and regulations, environmental regulations, labor laws and other government requirements, approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers and trade remedies such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences associated with our permanent establishment of operations in more countries, including repatriation of non-U.S. earnings taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory effective tax rate;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate, including changes in government incentives relating to power generation and solar electricity, and availability of capital at competitive rates;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailments of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe inability to work successfully with third-parties with local expertise to co-develop international projects;\n\u2022\nrelatively uncertain legal systems, including potentially limited protection for intellectual property rights and laws, changes in the governmental incentives we rely on, regulations and policies which impose additional restrictions on the ability of foreign companies to conduct business in certain countries or otherwise place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestic companies;\n\u2022\ninternational business practices that may conflict with CBP or other legal requirements enforced by partner government agencies;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer sales and payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\nDoing business in foreign markets requires us to be able to respond to rapid changes in market, legal, and political conditions in these countries. The success of our business will depend in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political environments. We recognize that we must understand the risks and opportunities relating to trade remedies so that we can develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities (for example, Mexico\u2019s electricity sector is federally owned and controlled by the Federal Electricity Commission). We can be held liable for the corrupt or\nother illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anticorruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nOur vertical integration and continued international expansion efforts may subject us to additional regulatory risks that may impact our operating results. For example, we will have to ensure we are in compliance with any bilateral and/or multilateral free trade agreements in addition to understanding trade remedies that directly affect those products and components involved in the construction of our solar energy systems, which are procured from vendors and manufacturers outside of the United States. Some of these components, particularly solar panels and mounting hardware made from aluminum extrusions, may be subject to antidumping and countervailing duties.\nIn March 2015, we conducted an internal review of our supply chain and import practices for our subsidiary, Zep Solar, which included a review of the classification of products manufactured overseas. We identified instances in which some of the products and system components imported into the United States were misclassified. As a result of these misclassifications, we discovered that two legacy products might be subject to antidumping and countervailing duties. In September 2015, we submitted a voluntary disclosure to the CBP identifying these and other potential misclassifications, cooperating fully with CBP to finalize this review. In April 2016, we perfected our disclosure tendering $5.3 million to CBP for import duties owed by our acquired subsidiary relating to items imported since August 2012. For items potentially subject to antidumping or countervailing duties, CBP may require us to obtain a determination from the DOC.\nIn the event that we fail to or are unable to comply with the legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties and other amounts which could materially harm our operations and financial results.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business.\nIn August 2015, we acquired Iliosson S.A. de C.V., a commercial and industrial solar project developer in Mexico. In September 2014, we acquired Silevo, LLC, a solar panel technology and manufacturing company. In 2013, we acquired Zep Solar, Common Assets, certain assets of Paramount Solar and completed other smaller acquisitions. In the future, we may acquire additional companies, project pipelines, products or technologies, or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. Our ability as an organization to integrate acquisitions is unproven. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or any other future acquisition or the acquisition may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors.\nAny acquisition has numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information and other administrative systems;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u2022\nincurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure of due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among other things;\n\u2022\ninability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective; and\n\u2022\ninability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, or if material weaknesses are discovered in future periods, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial and operating reporting may be adversely affected, and confidence in our operations and disclosures may be lost.\nIn the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with this annual report on Form 10-K, our management has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.\nIf we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, or if additional material weaknesses are discovered in future periods, a risk that is significantly increased in light of the complexity of our business and investment funds, we may be unable to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or key operating metrics, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements or other corrective disclosures, an inability to access commercial lending markets, defaults under our secured revolving credit facility and other agreements, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nUpdates or changes to our IT systems affecting our customer billing and control environment may disrupt our operations.\nAs we continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems affecting our customer billing and control environment, some of which are significant, we may encounter unexpected challenges, outages and other issues. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and our ability to timely and accurately report our financial and operating results.\nWe are not currently regulated as a utility under applicable law, but we may be subject to regulation as a utility in the future.\nFederal law and most state laws do not currently regulate us as a utility. As a result, we are not subject to the various federal and state standards, restrictions and regulatory requirements applicable to U.S. utilities. In the United States, we obtain federal and state regulatory exemptions by establishing \u201cQualifying Facility\u201d status with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for all of our qualifying solar energy projects. In Canada, we also are generally subject to the regulations of the relevant energy regulatory agencies applicable to all producers of electricity under the relevant feed-in tariff regulations (including the feed-in tariff rates), however we are not currently subject to regulation as a utility. Our business strategy includes the continued development of larger solar energy systems in the future for our commercial and government customers, which has the potential to impact our regulatory position. Any local, state, federal or foreign regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting our sale of electricity. If we were subject to the same state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities as utilities in the United States or if new regulatory bodies were established to oversee our business in the United States or in foreign markets, then our operating costs would materially increase.\nIn our lease pass-through financing funds, there is a one-time reset of the lease payments, and we may be obligated, in connection with the resetting of the lease payments at true up, to refund lease prepayments or to contribute additional assets to the extent the system sizes, costs and timing are not consistent with the initial lease payment model.\nIn our lease pass-through financing funds, the models used to calculate the lease prepayments will be updated for each fund at a fixed date occurring after placement in service of all solar energy systems in a given fund or on an agreed upon date (typically within the first year of the applicable lease term) to reflect certain specified conditions as they exist at such date, including the ultimate system size of the equipment that was leased, how much it cost and when it went into service. As a result of such a true up, the lease payments are resized and we may be obligated to refund the investor\u2019s lease prepayments or to contribute additional assets to the fund. Any significant refunds or capital contributions that we may be required to make could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have guaranteed a minimum return to be received by an investor in one of our financing funds and could be adversely affected if we are required to make any payments under this guarantee.\nWe have guaranteed payments to the investor in one of our financing funds to compensate for payments that the investor would be required to make to a certain third-party as a result of the investor not achieving a specified minimum internal rate of return in this fund, assessed annually. Although the investor has achieved the specified minimum internal rate of return to date, the amounts of any potential future payments under this guarantee depend on the amounts and timing of future distributions to the investor from the fund and the tax benefits that accrue to the investor from the fund\u2019s activities. Because of uncertainties associated with estimating the timing and amounts of future distributions to the investor, we cannot determine the potential maximum future payments that we could have to make under this guarantee. We may agree to similar guarantees in the future if market conditions require it. Any significant payments that we may be required to make under our guarantees could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe face competition from both traditional energy companies and renewable energy companies.\nThe solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with large utilities. We believe that our primary competitors are the traditional utilities that supply energy to our potential customers. We compete with these utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. If we cannot offer compelling value to our customers based on these factors, then our business will not grow. Utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do. As a result of their greater size, these competitors may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Utilities could also offer other value-added products and services that could help them compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher than ours. In addition, a majority of utilities\u2019 sources of electricity is non-solar, which may allow utilities to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar energy systems.\nWe also compete with solar companies in the downstream value chain of solar energy. For example, we face competition from purely finance driven organizations which then subcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses that seek financing from external parties, from large construction companies and utilities and increasingly from sophisticated electrical and roofing companies. Some of these competitors specialize in either the residential or commercial solar energy markets, and some may provide energy at lower costs than we do. Many of our competitors also have significant brand name recognition and have extensive knowledge of our target markets. Competitors have increasingly begun vertically integrating their operations to offer comprehensive products and services offerings similar to ours, and, recently, we have seen increased consolidation of competitors in our primary markets.\nProjects for our significant commercial and government customers involve concentrated project risks that may cause significant changes in our financial results.\nDuring any given financial reporting period, we typically have ongoing significant projects for commercial and governmental customers that represent a significant portion of our potential financial results for such period. For example, Walmart is a significant customer for which we have installed a substantial number of solar energy systems. These larger projects create concentrated operating and financial risks. The effect of recognizing revenue or other financial measures on the sale of a larger project, or the failure to recognize revenue or other financial measures as anticipated in a given reporting period because a project is not yet completed under applicable accounting rules by period end, may materially impact our quarterly or annual financial results. In addition, if construction, warranty or operational issues arise on a larger project, or if the timing of such projects unexpectedly shifts for other reasons, such issues could have a material impact on our financial results. If we are unable to successfully manage these significant projects in multiple markets, including our related internal processes and external construction management, or if we are unable to continue to attract such significant customers and projects in the future, our financial results could be harmed.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels and other system components to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar energy systems. Any shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations and loss of our ability to effectively compete.\nWe purchase solar panels, inverters and other system components from a limited number of suppliers, which makes us susceptible to quality issues, shortages and price changes. If we fail to develop, maintain and expand our relationships with existing or new suppliers, including our recent long-term manufacturing relationship with Panasonic, we may be unable to adequately meet anticipated demand for our solar energy systems or we may only be able to offer our systems at higher costs or after delays. If one or more of the suppliers that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production, we may be unable to satisfy this demand due to an inability to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn particular, there are a limited number of inverter suppliers. Once we design a system for use with a particular inverter, if that type of inverter is not readily available at an anticipated price, we may incur additional delay and expense to redesign the system.\nIn addition, production of solar panels involves the use of numerous raw materials and components. Several of these have experienced periods of limited availability, particularly polysilicon, as well as indium, cadmium telluride, aluminum and copper. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these raw materials and components has a long lead time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. The prices for these raw materials and components fluctuate depending on global market conditions and demand and we may experience rapid increases in costs or sustained periods of limited supplies.\nIn addition to purchasing from New York-based suppliers, we anticipate that we will need to purchase supplies globally in order to meet the anticipated production output of the Manufacturing Facility. Despite our efforts to obtain raw materials and components from multiple sources whenever possible, many of our suppliers may be single-source suppliers of certain components. If we are not able to maintain long-term supply agreements or identify and qualify multiple sources for raw materials and components, our access to supplies at satisfactory prices, volumes and quality levels may be harmed. We may also experience delivery delays of raw materials and components from suppliers in various global locations. In addition, we may be unable to establish alternate supply relationships or obtain or engineer replacement components in the short term, or at all, at favorable prices or costs. Qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain components may be time-consuming and costly and may force us to make modifications to our product designs.\nOur need to purchase supplies globally in order to meet the anticipated production output of the Manufacturing Facility and our continued international expansion further subjects us to risks relating to currency fluctuations. Any decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currency of our component suppliers could increase our component prices. In addition, the state of the financial markets could limit our suppliers\u2019 ability to raise capital if they are required to expand their production to meet our needs or satisfy their operating capital requirements. Changes in economic and business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers\u2019 solvency and ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Any of these shortages, delays or price changes could limit our growth, cause cancellations or adversely affect our profitability and ability to effectively complete in the markets in which we operate.\nWe act as the licensed general contractor for our customers and are subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns, delays, regulatory compliance and other contingencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a licensed contractor or use licensed subcontractors in every community we service, and we are responsible for every customer installation. For our residential projects, we are the general contractor, construction manager and installer. For our commercial projects, we are the general contractor and construction manager, and we have historically relied on licensed subcontractors to install these commercial systems. We may be liable to customers for any damage we cause to their home or facility and belongings or property during the installation of our systems. For example, we frequently penetrate our customers\u2019 roofs during the installation process and may incur liability for the failure to adequately weatherproof such penetrations following the completion of construction. In addition, shortages of skilled subcontractor labor for our commercial projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Because our profit on a particular installation is based in part on assumptions as to the cost of such project, cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may cause us to not achieve our expected margins or not cover our costs for that project.\nIn addition, the installation of solar energy systems and energy-storage systems requiring building modifications are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national, state and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes, safety, utility interconnection and metering, environmental protection and related matters. It is difficult and costly to track the requirements of every individual authority having jurisdiction over our installations and to design solar energy systems to comply with these varying standards. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems may result in significant additional expenses to us and our customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our systems.\nCompliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and non-compliance with such requirements may result in potentially significant monetary penalties, operational delays and adverse publicity.\nThe installation of solar energy systems requires our employees to work at heights with complicated and potentially dangerous electrical systems. The evaluation and installation of our energy-storage and related products requires our employees to work in locations that may contain potentially dangerous levels of asbestos, lead or mold. We also maintain a fleet of thousands of vehicles that our employees use in the course of their work. There is substantial risk of serious injury or death if proper safety procedures are not followed. Our operations are subject to regulation under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and equivalent state laws. Changes to OSHA requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in\nincreased costs. If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA regulations, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant capital expenditures or suspend or limit operations. In the past, we have had workplace accidents and received citations from OSHA regulators for alleged safety violations, resulting in fines and operational delays for certain projects. Any such accidents, citations, violations, injuries or failure to comply with industry best practices may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect our business.\nProblems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses and performance guarantee expenses, may lower the residual value of our solar energy systems and adversely affect our financial performance and valuation.\nOur solar energy system warranties are lengthy. Customers who buy energy from us under leases or power purchase agreements are covered by warranties equal to the length of the term of these agreements-typically 20 years for leases and power purchase agreements. Depending on the state where they live, customers who purchase our solar energy systems for cash are covered by a warranty up to 10 years in duration. We also make extended warranties available at an additional cost to customers who purchase our solar energy systems for cash. In addition, we provide a pass-through of the inverter and panel manufacturers\u2019 warranties to our customers, which generally range from 5 to 30 years. One of these third-party manufacturers could cease operations and no longer honor these warranties, leaving us to fulfill these potential obligations to our customers. For example, Evergreen Solar, Inc., one of our former solar panel suppliers, filed for bankruptcy in August 2011. Further, we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease.\nWe rely upon assumptions and judgments based on our operating history and accelerated life cycle testing regarding a number of factors, including our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the durability, performance and reliability of our solar energy systems. Our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual long-term performance of our systems, causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar energy systems in the future or to compensate customers for systems that do not meet their production guarantees. Product failures or operational deficiencies would also reduce our revenue from power purchase agreements because they are dependent on system production. Any widespread product failures or operating deficiencies may damage our market reputation and adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, we amortize the costs of our solar energy systems over 30 to 35 years, which typically exceeds the period of the component warranties and the corresponding payment streams from our operating lease arrangements with our customers. In addition, we typically bear the cost of removing the solar energy systems at the end of the lease term. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict how future environmental regulations may affect the costs associated with the removal, disposal and recycling of our solar energy systems. Consequently, if the residual value of the systems is less than we expect at the end of the lease, after giving effect to any associated removal and redeployment costs, we may be required to accelerate all or some of the remaining unamortized expenses. This could materially impair our future operating results.\nCompliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and non-compliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines.\nWe are required to comply with all foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding pollution control and protection of the environment. In addition, under some statutes and regulations, a government agency, or other parties, may seek recovery and response costs from operators of property where releases of hazardous substances have occurred or are ongoing, even if the operator was not responsible for such release and not otherwise at fault. While we and the State of New York have performed environmental diligence relating to the construction of the Manufacturing Facility, the site where the Manufacturing Facility is to be located is on the former site of Republic Steel and has been considered a \u201cbrownfield.\u201d\nThe operation of our manufacturing and research and development facilities, including in Hangzhou, China, Buffalo, New York and Fremont, California, involves the use of hazardous chemicals and materials which may subject us to liabilities for any releases or other failures to comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies. Any failure by us to maintain effective controls regarding the use of hazardous materials or to obtain and maintain all necessary permits could subject us to potentially significant fines and damages or interrupt our operations.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.\nWe would be exposed to product liability claims if one of our solar energy systems or other products injured any property or persons. Because solar energy systems and many of our other current and anticipated products are electricity-producing and storing devices, it is possible that property or persons could be harmed by our products for reasons including product malfunctions, defects or improper installation. We rely on our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance. Any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention.\nAny product liability claims against us and any resulting adverse outcomes could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position or adversely affect sales of our systems and other products.\nThe production and installation of solar energy systems depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions. If meteorological conditions are unexpectedly unfavorable, the electricity production from our solar energy systems may be substantially below our expectations and our ability to timely deploy new systems may be adversely impacted.\nThe energy produced and revenue and cash receipts generated by a solar energy system depend on suitable solar and weather conditions, both of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, components of our systems, such as panels and inverters, could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms or tornadoes. In these circumstances, we generally would be obligated to bear the expense of repairing or replacing the damaged solar energy systems that we own. Sustained unfavorable weather also could unexpectedly delay our installation of solar energy systems, leading to increased expenses and decreased revenue and cash receipts in the relevant periods. For example, certain states in which we operate, such as New York and Massachusetts, commonly experience inclement winter weather. Weather patterns could change, making it harder to predict the average annual amount of sunlight striking each location where we install. This could make our solar energy systems less economical overall or make individual systems less economical. Any of these events or conditions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be harmed if we fail to properly protect our intellectual property.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends in part on our proprietary technology, including our hardware, software, information, processes and know-how. We rely on many forms of intellectual property rights to secure our technology, including trade secrets and patents. We cannot be certain that we have adequately protected or will be able to adequately protect our technology, that our competitors will not be able to use our existing technology or develop similar technology independently, that any patents or other intellectual property rights held by us will be broad enough to protect our technology or that foreign intellectual property laws will adequately protect us. Moreover, our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a competitive advantage.\nDespite our precautions, it may be possible for third-parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our consent. Reverse engineering, unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third-parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us for doing so. In addition, our proprietary technology may not be adequately protected because:\n\u2022\nour systems may be subject to intrusions, security breaches or targeted thefts of our trade secrets;\n\u2022\npeople may not be deterred from misappropriating our technology despite the existence of laws or contracts prohibiting it;\n\u2022\nunauthorized use of our intellectual property may be difficult to detect and expensive and time-consuming to remedy, and any remedies obtained may be inadequate to restore protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nthe laws of other countries in which we do business may offer less protection for our proprietary technology; and\n\u2022\nreports we may be required to file in connection with any government-sponsored research contracts may disclose some of our sensitive confidential information because they are or will be generally available to the public.\nAny such activities or any other inabilities to adequately protect our proprietary rights could harm our ability to compete, to generate revenue and to grow our business.\nClaims of patent and other intellectual property infringement are complex and their outcomes are uncertain, and the costs associated with such claims may be high and could harm our business.\nOur success in operating our business depends largely on our ability to use and develop our proprietary technologies and manufacturing know-how without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third-parties, many of whom have robust patent portfolios, greater capital resources and decades of manufacturing experience. Any claim of infringement by a third-party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial legal costs defending against the claim and could distract our management and technical personnel from our business. In particular, the validity and scope of claims relating to photovoltaic technology patents may be highly uncertain because they involve complex scientific, legal and factual considerations and analysis. Furthermore, we could be subject to a judgment or voluntarily enter into a settlement, either of which could require us to pay substantial damages. A judgment or settlement could also include an injunction, a court order or other agreement that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities. In addition, we might elect or be required to seek a license for the use of third-party intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if available, the payments under such license may harm our operating results and financial condition. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, redesign our products or alter our manufacturing\ntechniques and processes, each of which could require significant research and development efforts and expenses and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional claims or legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price for our securities.\nWe are involved in claims, legal proceedings (such as the class action and derivative lawsuits filed against us) and receive inquiries from government and regulatory agencies (such as the pending Treasury and Department of Labor investigations) that arise from our normal business activities. In addition, from time to time, third-parties may assert claims against us. We evaluate all claims, lawsuits and investigations with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counter claims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. In the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes. Although outcomes of such actions vary, any claims, proceedings or regulatory actions initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in expensive costs of defense, costly damage awards, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant operational resources or some other harm to our business. In any of these cases, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such controversy, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future business, financial condition or results of operations, or all of the foregoing, in a particular quarter.\nWe typically bear the risk of loss and the cost of maintenance and repair on solar systems that are owned or leased by our fund investors.\nWe typically bear the risk of loss and are generally obligated to cover the cost of maintenance and repair on any solar systems that we sell or lease to our fund investors. At the time we sell or lease a solar system to a fund investor, we enter into a maintenance services agreement where we agree to operate and maintain the system for a fixed fee that is calculated to cover our future expected maintenance costs. If our solar systems require an above-average amount of repairs or if the cost of repairing systems were higher than our estimate, we would need to perform such repairs without additional compensation. If our solar systems, a majority of which are located in California, are damaged in a natural disaster beyond our control, losses could be excluded, such as earthquake damage, or exceed insurance policy limits, and we could incur unforeseen costs that could harm our business and financial condition. We may also incur significant costs for taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, such events. We purchase Property and Business Interruption insurance with industry standard coverage and limits approved by an investor\u2019s third-party insurance advisors to hedge against such risk, but such coverage may not cover our losses.\nAny unauthorized disclosure or theft of personal customer information we gather, store and use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation.\nWe receive, store and use personal information of our customers, including names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit information and other housing and energy use information. Unauthorized disclosure of such personal information could harm our business, whether through breach of our systems by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise. If we were subject to an inadvertent disclosure of such personal information or if a third-party were to gain unauthorized access to customer personal information in our possession, our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by our customers. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of federal, state and local laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal customer information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business.\nAny failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our interactions with current or prospective residential customers could result in negative publicity, claims, investigations, and litigation, and adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs the country\u2019s largest residential solar installer, we rely on our ability to engage in transactions with residential customers. In doing so, we must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern matters relating to our interactions\nwith residential consumers, including those pertaining to privacy and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, home improvement contracts, warranties and door-to-door solicitation. These laws and regulations change frequently and are interpreted by various federal, state and local regulatory bodies. Changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how and where we conduct our business, acquire customers, and manage and use information we collect from and about current and prospective customers and the costs associated therewith.\nEven though we may believe that we maintain effective compliance with all such laws and regulations, we may still be subject to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, and could be subject to substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business and operations. For example, a putative class action was filed against us in November 2015 alleging violations of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with such laws and regulations, and increased regulation of matters relating to our interactions with residential consumers could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information of our customers. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between one company and its subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices. Any failure by us, our affiliates or other parties with whom we do business to comply with a posted privacy policies or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, which could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 13711, "SIC": 3620, "TIC": "SCTY.1"}
