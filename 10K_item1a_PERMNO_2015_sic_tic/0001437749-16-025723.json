{"cik": "1121484", "company": "OIL STATES INTERNATIONAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nDemand for most of our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. We believe our customers\u2019 capital expenditures will further decline in 2016 and beyond if the current depressed oil and natural gas price environment continues or worsens. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 that has continued in 2016 has caused a reduction in most of our customers\u2019 drilling, completion and other production activities and related spending on our products and services in 2015. The reduction in demand from our customers has resulted in an oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, and such oversupply has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for our services, particularly customers of our well site services segment. These conditions generally worsened throughout 2015 and, if oil and natural gas prices remain depressed or further decline, this further reduction in our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending, and reductions in the prices we charge, could continue and accelerate through 2016 and beyond. In addition, a continuation or worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers\u2019 liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts. These conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current depressed commodity price environment will continue.\nShould the depressed commodity price environment not improve or decrease further, we could encounter difficulties such as an inability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, the incurrence of asset impairment charges, an inability to meet financial ratios contained in our debt agreements, a need to reduce our capital spending and other similar impacts. For example, under our credit agreement, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2015, we had $122.9 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement and $37.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving $439.4 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. However, we expect that we may not be able to access the entire amount available under the credit facility during 2016 and potentially beyond, as we expect our trailing twelve month EBITDA to decline during 2016, limiting the amount we may borrow while remaining in compliance with the total debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant. As more fully disclosed in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading \u201cLiquidity, Capital Resources and Other Matters\u201d, we discuss our expectations regarding liquidity and covenant compliance for 2016.\nMany factors affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, influence product prices, including:\n\u25cf\nthe level of drilling activity;\n\u25cf\nthe level of production;\n\u25cf\nthe levels of oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf\ndepletion rates;\n\u25cf\nworldwide demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe expected cost of finding, developing and producing new reserves;\n\u25cf\ndelays in major offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field development timetables;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict development;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of transportation infrastructure for oil and natural gas, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u25cf\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nworldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries;\n\u25cf\nnational government political requirements, including the ability and willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;\n\u25cf\nthe level of oil and natural gas production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations;\n\u25cf\nrapid technological change and the timing and extent of development of energy sources, including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or alternative fuels;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental and other governmental laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign tax policies.\nThe current oversupply of oil and natural gas relative to demand has resulted in significantly lower oil and natural gas prices. As a result, many of our customers have announced or are expected to announce reductions or delays in their capital spending in 2016, which consequently would reduce the demand for our products and services and exert additional downward pressure on the prices of our products and services. If the current depressed commodity price environment for oil and natural gas continues for a prolonged period, it will likely result in further reductions of capital expenditures by our customers, causing further declines in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and production activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in many ways including by negatively affecting:\n\u25cf\nour utilization, revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely affect our products and services.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, a certain portion of our completion services business supports many of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers in such activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in formations with low permeabilities, such as shale formations, and involves the pressurized injection of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate production. Due to concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing and fracturing fluids disposal on drinking water and groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated in the United States to render permitting, public disclosure and construction and operational compliance requirements for our customers more stringent for hydraulic fracturing. While hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated in the United States by state oil and natural gas commissions, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional CAA regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural-gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the United States and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews in the United States are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in June 2015, which report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not lead to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above- and below-ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that EPA\u2019s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as any future studies, depending on the results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by exploration and production operators, some of which are performed by our customers, and thus reduce demand for our North American completion products and services. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to use of the hydraulic fracturing process in the United States are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with requirements relating to permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and/or plugging and abandonment, as well as could experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, any of which could reduce demand for the products and services of each of our business segments.\nAdditional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and other related restrictions arising after the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon explosive incident and resulting oil spill in the United States Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the BOEM and the BSEE have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory restrictions, in addition to any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts.\nMoreover, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM and/or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in April 2015, the BSEE issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, expected to be finalized in 2016, that focuses on well blowout preventer systems and well control with respect to operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. The proposed rule requires, among other things, incorporation of the latest industry standards establishing minimum baseline standards for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers, as well as more controls over the maintenance and repair of blowout preventers. In a second example, in September 2015, the BOEM issued draft guidance that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities. Among other things, this draft guidance proposes to eliminate the \u201cwaiver\u201d exemption currently allowed by the BOEM with respect to offshore supplemental bonding in favor of a self-insurance mechanism that would allow more operators on the Outer Continental Shelf to seek self-insurance for a portion of their supplemental bonding obligations, but only for an amount that is no more than 10% of such operators\u2019 tangible net worth. The BOEM is expected to issue the draft guidance in the form of a final Notice to Lessees and Operators by no later than early summer 2016. If our customers are unable to obtain the additional required supplemental bonds or other financial assurances as directed by BOEM, the BOEM could impose monetary penalties or require the operations of those customers on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled.\nThese recent, or any new, rules, regulations or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our customer\u2019s operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause them to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of their facilities, which developments could reduce demand for our products and services. We may incur penalties directly from BSEE if, based on review of the facts surrounding an alleged violation upon an offshore lease, BSEE elects to hold contractors, including contractors such as us who are involved in well completion operations, potentially liable for alleged violations of law arising in the BSEE\u2019s jurisdiction area. Also, if material spill events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations or legal initiatives on our customers\u2019 drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations.\nThe cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2015, goodwill represented approximately 16% of our total assets. We have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses that we acquired than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses. We are required to periodically review the goodwill for each of our reporting units (completion services, drilling services and offshore products) for impairment in value and to recognize a non-cash charge against earnings with a corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity if circumstances, some of which are beyond our control, indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable. It is possible that we could recognize goodwill impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:\n\u25cf\nglobal economic conditions deteriorate;\n\u25cf\nthe outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate further as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, technology becoming obsolete, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions, or restructuring plans;\n\u25cf\ncosts of equity or debt capital increase; or\n\u25cf\nvaluations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate.\nWe do business in international jurisdictions which exposes us to unique risks.\nA portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries. These activities accounted for approximately 27% (12% excluding the UK and Canada) of our consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015. Risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u25cf\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nforeign exchange limitations;\n\u25cf\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nforeign taxation;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital in a tax efficient manner;\n\u25cf changing political conditions;\n\u25cf changing foreign and domestic monetary policies;\n\u25cf social, political, military, and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business, and the possibilities of war, other armed conflict or terrorist attacks; and\n\u25cf regional economic downturns.\nAn illustration of this risk is the current recessionary economic conditions in Brazil which, at present, are having a negative impact on future orders and growth prospects for the Company\u2019s operations in Brazil. Sales to customers in Brazil accounted for approximately 5% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues during 2015 and 4% in 2014.\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors, or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete in such jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also face fines, sanctions, and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in, or curtailment of, business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of assets. Additionally, we may have competitors who are not subject to the same ethics-related laws and regulations which provides them with a competitive advantage over us by securing business awards, licenses, or other preferential treatment, in those jurisdictions using methods that certain ethics-related laws and regulations prohibit us from using.\nThe regulatory regimes in some foreign countries may be substantially different than those in the United States, and may be unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of foreign laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. reported results of operations and financial position.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into purchase and sales commitments that are denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currency used by our operating subsidiaries. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can create volatility in our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate net revenues or earnings in countries whose currency is not the U.S. dollar, the translation of such amounts into U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our net revenues and earnings depending upon exchange rate movements. With respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations, for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 27% of our revenues originated from subsidiaries outside of the U.S. and were denominated in currencies including, among others, the pound sterling. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on our reported revenues, net income, and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are significantly affected by stringent foreign, federal, provincial, state, and local laws, and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages under these laws and regulations, with certain of these legal requirements imposing strict liability for such damages and costs, even though our conduct was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct resulting in such damage and costs were caused by, prior operators or other third-parties. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent legal requirements. If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change, we may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:\n\u25cf\nissuance of administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\ndenial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u25cf\nreduction or cessation in operations; and\n\u25cf\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Certain environmental statutes impose joint and several, strict liability for these costs. For example, an accidental release by us in the performance of services at one of our or our customers\u2019 sites could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs, and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nClimate change continues to receive increasing attention from the general public, the scientific community, and governments, both in the United States and in foreign countries. The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of any change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions. Among other regulatory efforts, significant focus is being made on companies that are active producers of depleting natural resources.\nThere are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address GHG emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of foreign and domestic federal, regional, provincial, and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. Among other things, these actions could:\n\u25cf\nresult in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers' operations;\n\u25cf\nadversely impact overall drilling activity in the areas in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nreduce the demand for carbon-based fuels; and\n\u25cf\nreduce the demand for our products and services.\nAny adoption of these or similar proposals by foreign or domestic federal, regional, or state governments, mandating a substantial reduction in GHG emissions, or imposing a carbon tax on emission of GHGs, could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions, would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our products and services. See \"Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\" for a more detailed description of our climate change-related risks.\nCurrently proposed legislative changes, including changes to tax laws and regulations, could materially, negatively impact the Company by increasing the costs of doing business and decreasing the demand for our products and services.\nThe current U.S. administration and Congress have proposed several new articles of legislation or legislative and administrative changes, including changes to tax laws and regulations, which could have a material negative effect on our Company. Some of the proposed changes that could negatively impact us are:\n\u25cf\ncap and trade system for emissions;\n\u25cf\nincreased supplemental bonding limits on exploration and production decommissioning activities;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs and exploration and development costs;\n\u25cf\nincrease of the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs to seven years;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of percentage depletion;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and natural gas production;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and natural gas properties;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the credits for enhanced oil recovery projects and production from marginal wells;\n\u25cf\nrepeal of the deduction for tertiary injectants;\n\u25cf\nchanges to the tax treatment of Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs); and\n\u25cf\nchanges to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation.\nWe are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.\nOur operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States can restrict access to work areas for our well site services segment customers. Our operations in and near the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Weather conditions in the Gulf Coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring, summer and fall months, with the lowest activity in the winter months. In addition, summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. A portion of our completion services operations in Canada are conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and, as a result, adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide products and services in the second and, to a lesser extent, third quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to subcontractors\u2019 performance in some of our projects.\nIn many cases, we subcontract the performance of portions of our operations to subcontractors. While we seek to obtain appropriate indemnities and guarantees from these subcontractors, we remain ultimately responsible for the performance of our subcontractors. Industrial disputes, natural disasters, financial failure or default, or inadequate performance in the provision of services, or the inability to provide services by such subcontractors, has the potential to materially adversely affect us.\nOur inability to control the inherent risks of identifying and integrating businesses that we may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.\nAcquisitions have been, and our management believes will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. However, we may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders.\nWe expect to gain certain business, financial, and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. An inability to realize expected financial performance and strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\nretaining key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nretaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nretaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;\n\u25cf\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u25cf\ndeveloping our sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u25cf\nmanaging our growth effectively;\n\u25cf\npotential goodwill impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nintegrating operations;\n\u25cf managing tax and foreign exchange exposure;\n\u25cf operating a new line of business;\n\u25cf increased logistical problems common to large, expansive operations;\n\u25cf inability to pursue and protect patents covering acquired technology; and\n\u25cf becoming subject to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and shareholders of the Company may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial, and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and our insurance may not cover certain liabilities, including litigation risks.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers\u2019 costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life, damages to property, equipment, or the environment, regulatory investigations and penalties, and the suspension or cancellation of the end-user\u2019s operations. If our products or services fail to meet specifications, or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract, or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees, and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold, and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses.\nWe maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\nwe may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance, such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks;\n\u25cf\nthe counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and\n\u25cf\nwe may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.\nWe depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments, and the loss of one or more such customers or the inability of one or more such customers to meet their obligations to us, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments. For a more detailed explanation of our customers for each of our business segments, see \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d The loss of any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments, or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers, could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in one industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables.\nAs a result of our customer concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of equity. Many of our customers are experiencing substantial reductions in their cash flows from operations, and some are experiencing liquidity shortages, lack of access to capital and credit markets, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, and other adverse impacts to their financial condition. These conditions may result in a significant reduction in our customers\u2019 liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. The inability, or failure of, our significant customers to meet their obligations to us, or their insolvency or liquidation, may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, and we expect it to continue to remain volatile in the future.\nThe market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and natural gas services industry has been highly volatile. Likewise, the market price of our common stock has varied significantly in the past, and we expect it to continue to remain highly volatile given the cyclical nature of our industry.\nWe may assume contractual risks in developing, manufacturing and delivering products in our offshore products business segment.\nMany of our products from our offshore products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project-specific contracts. In some cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines. In addition, some customer contracts stipulate consequential damages payable, generally as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. The final delivered products may also include customer and third-party supplied equipment, the delay of which can negatively impact our ability to deliver our products on time at our anticipated profitability.\nIn certain cases these orders include new technology or unspecified design elements. In some cases we may not be fully, or, properly compensated for the cost to develop and design the final products, negatively impacting our profitability on the projects. In addition, our customers, in many cases, request changes to the original design or bid specifications for which we may not be fully or properly compensated.\nAs is customary for our offshore products segment, we agree to provide products under fixed-price contracts, typically assuming responsibility for cost overruns. Our actual costs, and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts, may vary from the initially expected contract economics. There is inherent risk in the estimation process including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges, or longer than expected lead times. A fixed-price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices (including the price of steel) through increased pricing.\nIn fulfilling some contracts, we provide limited warranties for our products. Although we estimate and record a provision for potential warranty claims, repair or replacement costs under warranty provisions in our contracts could exceed the estimated cost to cure the claim, which could be material to our financial results. We utilize percentage-of-completion accounting, depending on the size and length of a project, and variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our reported operating results as we progress toward completion of major jobs.\nBacklog in our offshore products segment is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an imperfect indicator of our future revenues and earnings.\nThe revenues projected in our offshore products segment backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers\u2019 projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. In addition, even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Material delays, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nReductions in our backlog due to cancellations or deferrals by customers, or for other reasons, would adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Some of the contracts in our backlog are cancellable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. We typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog once a project is cancelled. While backlog cancellations have not been significant in the past, we incurred cancellations totaling $21.1 million during 2015 ($3.4 million occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015) and our backlog in our offshore products segment decreased to $340 million at December 31, 2015, from $490 million at December 31, 2014, and $580 million at December 31, 2013, which we believe is attributable to lower commodity prices and the resultant decrease in capital spending by our clients. If commodity prices do not improve, we may incur additional cancellations or declines in our backlog during 2016. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions, or scope adjustments, to contracts included in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, may be adversely impacted.\nWe might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel.\nMany of the products that we sell, especially in our offshore products segment, are complex and highly engineered, and often must perform in harsh conditions. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and enhance these products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force. During periods of increased activity, the demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. When these events occur, our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired. Conversely, during periods of reduced activity, we are forced to reduce headcount, freeze or reduce wages, and implement other cost-saving measures which could lead to job abandonment by our technical personnel.\nWe might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product, equipment and service quality, availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, safety performance, and price. In some of our business segments, we compete with the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services, and changes in customer requirements. Some contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services, or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not develop new competitive technologies and products, our business and revenues may be adversely affected.\nThe market for our offshore products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater water depths, higher pressure levels and harsher conditions. If we are unable to design, develop, and produce commercially, competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. In addition, competitors or customers may develop new technologies, which address similar or improved solutions to our existing technology. Additionally, the development and commercialization of new products and services requires substantial capital expenditures and we may not have access to needed capital at attractive rates or at all due to our financial condition, disruptions of the bank or capital markets, or other reasons beyond our control to continue these activities. Should our technologies, particularly in offshore products or in our completion services business, become the less attractive solution, our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe, or be alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under a license from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDuring periods of strong demand, we may be unable to obtain critical project materials on a timely basis.\nOur operations depend on our ability to procure, on a timely basis, certain project materials, such as forgings, to complete projects in an efficient manner. Our inability to procure critical materials, in particular during times of strong demand, or an increase in the cost of such materials, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nOur operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the oilfield business. These include, but are not limited to, equipment defects, blowouts, explosions, spills, fires, collisions, capsizing, and severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards as part of our ongoing business operations. We may agree to indemnify our customers against specific risks and liabilities. While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations may suffer due to increased industry-wide capacity of certain types of equipment or assets.\nThe demand for and pricing of certain types of our assets and equipment, particularly our drilling rigs and completion services assets, is subject to the overall availability of such assets in the marketplace. If demand for our assets were to decrease, or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our capacity in excess of current demand, we may encounter decreased pricing for, or utilization of, our assets and services, which could adversely impact our operations and profits.\nWe might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our offshore products and completion services businesses, particularly our patents relating to our FlexJoint\u00ae and Merlin\u2122 technology and intervention and downhole extended-reach tools (including our HydroPull\u00ae tool) utilized in the completion or workover of oil and natural gas wells. The market success of our technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies, to preserve rights in our trade secret and non-public information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. If any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, or if a court limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights, our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology, allowing competition for our customer base to increase. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure of our company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position.\nLoss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of our management. If any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain \"key man\" life insurance for any of our officers.\nEmployee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering 20 employees in Argentina and 7 employees in the United Kingdom. We have not experienced strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns in the past, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future. A prolonged strike, work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide limitations on the removal of directors, on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders, on stockholder action by written consent and on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of our company. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could increase the difficulty for a third-party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders' ability to sell their shares of our common stock at a premium.\nThe Spin-Off of Civeo may subject us to future liabilities.\nPursuant to agreements we entered into with Civeo in connection with the Spin-Off, we and Civeo are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses. Pursuant to those agreements, we and Civeo each agreed to cross-indemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of Civeo\u2019s business to it. However, third parties, including governmental agencies, could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that Civeo agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from Civeo will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities, or that Civeo will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Additionally, if a court were to determine that the Spin-Off or related transactions, including the payment of the dividend we received from Civeo, were consummated with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in Civeo receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent, or that it was rendered insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due, then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and Civeo and impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us, void some or all of the Spin-Off transactions or require us to repay some or all of the dividend we received in connection with the Spin-Off. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIf the Spin-Off, or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Spin-Off, were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain aspects of the Spin-Off. The private letter ruling, and an opinion we received from our tax advisor, each rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Civeo regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinion of our tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the Spin-Off is taxable in full or in part if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in our or Civeo\u2019s stock ownership. If the Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any reason, we and/or our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 88897, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "OIS"}
