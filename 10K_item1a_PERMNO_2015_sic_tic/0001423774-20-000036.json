{"cik": "1423774", "company": "ZUORA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information in this Form 10-K, including our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics, including COVID-19, and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters, pandemics and epidemics, or other catastrophic events such as fire, power shortages, and other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce, and the global economy, and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, changes in how we and companies worldwide conduct business due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to restrictions on travel and in-person meetings, could affect services delivery, delay implementations, and interrupt sales activity for our products. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events, such as Subscribed 2020 in the San Francisco Bay Area, to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of billings and subscription management solutions spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions or project implementation timing, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, result in requests from customers for payment or pricing concessions, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. As a result, we may experience extended sales cycles; our ability to close transactions with new and existing customers and partners may be negatively impacted; our ability to recognize revenue from software transactions we do close may be negatively impacted due to implementation delays or other factors; our demand generation activities, and the efficiency and effect of those activities, may be negatively affected; and our ability to provide 24x7 worldwide support to our customers may be affected. Moreover, it has been and, until the COVID-19 pandemic is contained, will continue to be more difficult for us to forecast our operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, put pressure on global economic conditions and overall spending for billings and subscription management solutions, and may cause our customers or their customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions, thereby lengthening sales cycles, and may make it difficult for us to forecast our sales and operating results and to make decisions about future investments. These and other potential effects on our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be significant and could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard, or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in development of our solution, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. For example, our corporate headquarters is located in California, a state that frequently experiences earthquakes. Additionally, all of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or the disaster recovery plans put in place by Zuora or our partners prove to be inadequate.\nWe have a history of net losses, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since inception, including net losses of $83.4 million, $72.7 million, and $39.4 million in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018, respectively. We expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of January 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $390.8 million. We expect to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business, including increasing our overall customer base, expanding relationships with existing customers, entering new vertical markets, expanding our global footprint, expanding and leveraging our relationships with strategic partners including GSIs to accelerate our growth, optimizing pricing and packaging, and expanding our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, and in connection with legal, accounting, and other administrative expenses related to operating as a public company. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently, or at all, to offset these increased expenses. While our revenue has grown in recent years, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than these increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. As a result, we may continue to generate losses. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.\nIf the shift by companies to subscription business models, including consumer adoption of products and services that are provided through such models, and, in particular, the market for subscription management software, develops slower than we expect, our growth may slow or stall, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on companies shifting to subscription business models and consumers choosing to consume products and services through such models. Many companies may be unwilling or unable to offer their solutions using a subscription business model, especially if they do not believe that the consumers of their products and services would be receptive to such offerings. Our success will also depend, to a large extent, on the willingness of medium and large businesses that have adopted subscription business models utilizing cloud-based products and services to manage billings and financial accounting relating to their subscriptions. The adoption of these models is still relatively new, and enterprises may not choose to shift their business model or, if they do, they may decide that they do not need a solution that offers the range of functionalities that we offer. Many companies have invested substantial effort and financial resources to develop custom-built applications or integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses as they shift to subscription or subscription business models and may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to different applications. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our solution, the future growth rate and size of the market for subscription management software, or the entry of competitive solutions. Factors that may affect market acceptance and sales of our products and services include:\n\u2022the number of companies shifting to subscription business models;\n\u2022the number of consumers and businesses adopting new, flexible ways to consume products and services;\n\u2022the security capabilities, reliability, and availability of cloud-based services;\n\u2022customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, especially transaction-critical, confidential, or sensitive data;\n\u2022our ability to minimize the time and resources required to deploy our solution;\n\u2022our ability to achieve and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction;\n\u2022our ability to deploy upgrades and other changes to our solution without disruption to our customers;\n\u2022the level of customization or configuration we offer;\n\u2022the overall level of corporate spending and spending on billing and subscription management solutions by our customers and prospects, including the impact of spending due to the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022general economic conditions, both in domestic and foreign markets; and\n\u2022the price, performance, and availability of competing products and services.\nThe markets for subscription products and services and for subscription management software may not develop further or may develop slower than we expect. If companies do not shift to subscription business models and subscription management software does not achieve widespread adoption, or if there is a reduction in demand for subscription products and services or subscription management software caused by technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, decreases in corporate spending, a lack of customer acceptance, or otherwise, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our subscription agreements with our customers generally provide for a minimum subscription platform fee and usage-based fees, which depend on the total dollar amount that is invoiced or managed on our solution. Because a portion of our revenue depends on the volume of transactions that our customers process through our solution, if our customers do not adopt our solution throughout their business, if their businesses decline or fail, or if they are unable to successfully shift to subscription business models, our revenue could decline and our operation results could be adversely impacted.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expect to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our operations and personnel in recent years. The growth and expansion of our business has placed and continues to place a significant strain on our management, operations, financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. In the event of further growth in our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations.\nTo manage growth in our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures, as well as training and experience oversight. Failure to manage growth effectively could result in difficulty or delays in deploying customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new products and services or enhancing existing products and services, loss of customers, or other operational difficulties in executing sales strategies, any of which could adversely affect our business performance and operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and expand sales to existing customers our revenue growth could be slower than we expect, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate billings and other business and financial management tools, including custom-built solutions, into its business, as such an organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new products and services. As a result, selling our solution often requires sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, sales and marketing expenses represented approximately 39% of our total revenue. If we fail to attract new customers and fail to maintain and expand new customer relationships, our revenue may grow more slowly than we expect and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur future revenue growth also depends upon expanding sales and renewals of subscriptions to our solution with existing customers. If our existing customers do not expand their use of our solution over time or do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all, or may decline. Our success, in part, is dependent on our ability to cross-sell Zuora RevPro products into our existing Zuora Billing customers. If we experience delays in integration or implementation of these products, revenue from cross-selling may grow more slowly or may not grow at all. In the three months ended April 30, 2019, we temporarily slowed down implementations between our Zuora RevPro and Zuora Billing customers due to product integration challenges. This temporary slowdown resulted in lower than expected total revenues for such quarter and resulted in us lowering our financial projections. We resumed the paused customer implementations in late fiscal 2020. Some of our customers are now operationally live on our integrated product, and we continue to work with the remaining customers on their implementation of the integrated product.\nWe plan to continue expanding our sales efforts, both domestically and internationally, but we may be unable to hire qualified sales personnel, may be unable to successfully train those sales personnel that we are able to hire, and sales personnel may not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected or at all. Additionally, although we dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including our Subscribed events, these sales and marketing programs may not have the desired effect and may not expand sales. We cannot assure you that our efforts would result in increased sales to existing customers, and additional revenue. If our efforts to\nexpand sales and renewals to existing customers are not successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur customers generally enter into subscription agreements with one- to three-year subscription terms and have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Moreover, our customers that do renew their subscriptions may renew for lower subscription or usage amounts or for shorter subscription periods. In addition, in the first year of a subscription, customers often purchase an increased level of professional services (such as training and deployment services) than they do in renewal years. Costs associated with maintaining a professional services department are relatively fixed in the short-term, while professional services revenue is dependent on the amount of billable work actually performed for customers in a period, the combination of which may result in variability in, and have a negative impact on, our gross profit. Customer renewals may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the breadth of early deployment, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, higher volumes of usage purchased upfront relative to actual usage during the subscription term, changes in customers\u2019 business models and use cases, our customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solution, our pricing or pricing structure, the pricing or capabilities of products or services offered by our competitors, or the effects of economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us, or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nOur revenue growth and ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend, in part, on being able to expand our direct sales force and increase the productivity of our sales force.\nTo date, most of our revenue has been attributable to the efforts of our direct sales force. In order to increase our revenue and achieve and sustain profitability, we must increase the size of our direct sales force, both in the United States and internationally, to generate additional revenue from new and existing customers.\nThere is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Because our solution is often sold to large enterprises and involves long sales cycle and complex customer requirements, it is more difficult to find sales personnel with the specific skills and technical knowledge needed to sell our solution and, even if we are able to hire qualified personnel, doing so may be expensive. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel to support our growth. Due to the complexities of our customer needs, new sales personnel require significant training and can take a number of months to achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and if our new sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected or at all, our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve long-term projections may be negatively impacted.\nWe may also be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional set up and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. In addition, as we continue to grow, a larger percentage of our sales force will be new to our company and our solution, which may adversely affect our sales if we cannot train our sales force quickly or effectively. Attrition rates may increase, and we may also face integration challenges as we continue to seek to expand our sales force. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, if attrition increases, or if the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product and service introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations, including potential changes and uncertainties associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in late October 2019, Robert Traube joined Zuora as our Chief Revenue Officer leading the sales organization and, in November 2019, we hired a Senior Vice President of Global Alliances, who, as part of Mr. Traube's team, is working to establish deeper relationships with our strategic partners. These and future changes in our sales organization may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.\nThe market in which we participate is competitive, and our operating results could be harmed if we do not compete effectively.\nThe market for subscription management products and services, including our billing and revenue recognition offerings, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution or professional services experience, or other resources or greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors supply a wide variety of products to, and have strong and well-established relationships with, current and potential customers. As a result, our current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements or devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services. In addition, some current and potential competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices or with greater depth than our solution, or integrate or bundle such products and services with their other product offerings. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than from a new supplier. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies with comparable functionality to our solution. In addition, because our products and services are integral to our customers\u2019 ability to accurately maintain books and records and prepare financial statements, our potential customers may prefer to purchase applications that are critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors, or leverage the software that they have already purchased from our competitors for their billing and accounting needs, or control such infrastructure internally. We may experience fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles, and loss of market share. This could lead us to decrease prices, implement alternative pricing structures, or introduce products and services available for free or a nominal price in order to remain competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, operating results, and financial condition will be adversely impacted if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.\nOur ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include: ease of use; subscription-based product features and functionality; ability to support the specific needs of companies with subscription business models; ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures and third-party applications; enterprise-grade performance and features such as system scalability, security, performance, and resiliency; vision for the market and product innovation; relationships with strategic partners, including GSIs, management consulting firms, and resellers; total cost of ownership; strength of sales and marketing efforts; brand awareness and reputation; and customer experience, including support and professional services. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our solution, as well as adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nMoreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others, including our current or future technology partners. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential customers. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenue from existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIf our security measures are breached, if unauthorized access to customer data, our data, or our solution is otherwise obtained, or if our solution is perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our solution, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other security incidents could result in the loss of information, disruption of services, litigation, indemnity obligations, penalties, and other liability. If our security measures or those of our service providers are breached, or are perceived to have been breached, as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our data or other data we or our service providers maintain, including sensitive customer data, personal information, intellectual property, and other confidential business information, we could face loss of business, lawsuits or claims, regulatory investigations, or orders, and our reputation could be severely damaged.\nWe have in the past experienced infrequent security incidents and breaches and may in the future experience additional security incidents or breaches. Although the security incidents and breaches that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, there is no assurance that our security systems or processes will prevent or mitigate more serious break-ins, tampering, security incidents or breaches or other cyber-attacks that could occur in the future. In late November 2019, we observed an increase in credit card authorization attempts by third parties made through our payment functionality embedded in certain of our customers\u2019 websites. We notified customers who were potentially impacted by the increased authorization attempts, and worked with our customers\nto help them implement remediation measures to help mitigate any such further activity. We currently do not expect expenses related to this matter to be material.\nIf we experience a security incident or breach, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate the problem, as well as incur significant costs and liabilities, including due to litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and costs for remediation and incentives offered to affected parties, including customers, other business partners and employees, in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach or other incident. Moreover, if our solution is perceived as not being secure, regardless of whether our security measures are actually breached, we could suffer harm to our reputation, and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nWe cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security-related matters. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient scope or amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nCyber-attacks and other malicious Internet-based activities continue to increase generally. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, contractors, or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyber-attack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers\u2019 data, other external data, or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our solution is perceived as having security vulnerabilities. Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our solution and perceive them to be not secure. This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs we would incur to address and respond to these security incidents, and to prevent them thereafter, would increase our expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims, and increased legal liability, including in some cases costs related to notification of the incident and fraud monitoring.\nOur success depends in large part on a limited number of products. If these products fail to gain or lose market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from sales of subscriptions and associated deployment of our Zuora Central platform and our Zuora Billing and Zuora RevPro products. As such, the continued growth in market demand for these products is critical to our success. Demand for our solution is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the growth or contraction of the Subscription Economy, continued market acceptance of our solution by customers for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new products and services, features, and functionality introduced by our competitors, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles that would impact the functionality and use of our solution, and technological change. We expect that an increasing transition to disaggregated solutions that focus on addressing specific customer use cases would continue to disrupt the enterprise software space, enabling new competitors to emerge. We cannot assure you that our solutions and future enhancements to our solution will be able to address future advances in technology or the requirements of enterprise customers. If we are unable to meet customer demands in creating a flexible solution designed to address all these needs or otherwise achieve more widespread market acceptance of our solution, our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects would be adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our future results difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results and subjects us to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and anticipate future growth. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance. We have\nencountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly evolving markets, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. Our operating results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable or are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022our ability to maintain and grow our customer base;\n\u2022our ability to retain and increase revenue from existing customers;\n\u2022our ability to introduce new products and services and enhance existing products and services;\n\u2022our ability to integrate or implement our existing products and services on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022our ability to deploy our products successfully within our customers' information technology ecosystems;\n\u2022our ability to enter into larger contracts;\n\u2022increases or decreases in subscriptions to our platform;\n\u2022our ability to sell to large enterprise customers;\n\u2022the transaction volume that our customers processes through our system;\n\u2022our ability to respond to competitive developments, including pricing changes and the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;\n\u2022the productivity of our sales force;\n\u2022our ability to grow our relationships with strategic partners such as GSIs and their effectiveness in increasing our sales and implementing our products;\n\u2022changes in the mix of products and services that our customers use;\n\u2022the length and complexity of our sales cycles;\n\u2022cost to develop and upgrade our solution to incorporate new technologies;\n\u2022seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers;\n\u2022impact of outages of our solution and reputational harm;\n\u2022costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies, or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs;\n\u2022failures or breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with responding to and addressing any such failures or breaches;\n\u2022foreign exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022changes to financial accounting standards and the interpretation of those standards that may affect the way we recognize and report our financial results, including changes in accounting rules governing recognition of revenue;\n\u2022the impact of changes to financial accounting standards;\n\u2022general economic and political conditions and government regulations in the countries where we currently operate or plan to expand;\n\u2022decisions by us to incur additional expenses, such as increases in sales and marketing or research and development;\n\u2022the timing of stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022political unrest, changes and uncertainty associated with terrorism, hostilities, war, natural disasters or pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022potential costs to attract, onboard, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nThe impact of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. If we fail to meet or exceed the\nexpectations of investors or securities analysts, then the trading price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including shareholder litigation.\nA customer\u2019s failure to deploy our solution after it enters into a subscription agreement with us, or the incorrect or improper deployment or use of our solution could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur solution is deployed in a wide variety of technology environments and into a broad range of complex workflows. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to increase both the speed and success of our deployments, by improving our deployment methodology, hiring and training qualified professionals, deepening relationships with deployment partners, and increasing our ability to integrate into large-scale, complex technology environments. We often assist our customers in deploying our solution. In other cases, customers rely on third-party partners to complete the deployment. In some cases, customers initially engage us to deploy our solution, but, for a variety of reasons, including strategic decisions not to utilize subscription business models, fail to ultimately deploy our solution. If we or our third-party partners are unable to deploy our solution successfully, or unable to do so in a timely manner and, as a result, customers do not utilize our solution, we would not be able to generate future revenue from such customers based on transaction or revenue volume and the upsell of additional products and services, and our future operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, customers may also seek refunds of their initial subscription fee. Moreover, customer perceptions of our solution may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew or expand their use of our solution.\nIf we are not able to develop and release new products and services, or successful enhancements, new features, and modifications to our existing products and services, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our solution, including our billing and revenue recognition offerings, is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. Additionally, because we provide billing and finance solutions to help our customers with compliance and financial reporting, changes in law, regulations, and accounting standards could impact the usefulness of our products and services and could necessitate changes or modifications to our products and services to accommodate such changes. Subscription management products and services, including our billing and revenue recognition offerings, are inherently complex, and our ability to develop and release new products and services or enhancements, new features and modifications to our existing products and services depends on several factors, including timely completion, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with new and existing technologies and our solution, and overall market acceptance. We cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing, marketing, and delivering on a timely and cost-effective basis enhancements or improvements to our platform or any new products and services that respond to continued changes in subscription management practices or new customer requirements, nor can we be sure that any enhancements or improvements to our platform or any new products and services will achieve market acceptance. Since developing our solution is complex, the timetable for the release of new products and enhancements to existing products is difficult to predict, and we may not offer new products and updates as rapidly as our customers require or expect. Any new products or services that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue. Moreover, even if we introduce new products and services, we may experience a decline in revenue of our existing products and services that is not offset by revenue from the new products or services. For example, customers may delay making purchases of new products and services to permit them to make a more thorough evaluation of these products and services or until industry and marketplace reviews become widely available. Some customers may hesitate to migrate to a new product or service due to concerns regarding the complexity of migration or performance of the new product or service. In addition, we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor\u2019s products and services or choose to utilize internally developed applications instead of our products and services. This could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, because our products and services are designed to interoperate with a variety of other internal or third-party software products and business systems applications, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in application programming interfaces (APIs), and other software and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these new products and services, modifications, and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. There is no assurance that we will successfully resolve such issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Furthermore, modifications to\nexisting platforms or technologies, including any APIs with which we interoperate, will increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our products and services to operate effectively with each other or with other platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in customer dissatisfaction, and adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, including senior management. If we lose the services of Tien Tzuo, our founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, or other critical talent across our executive team and in other key roles, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy.\nOur future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, assimilate, and retain highly skilled personnel, including software engineers, sales personnel, and professional services personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous software and other technology companies. In addition, competition for qualified personnel, particularly software engineers, is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located. We may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract, train, assimilate, or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. As we move into new geographies, we will need to attract and recruit skilled personnel in those areas. If we are unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational, and managerial requirements, on a timely basis or at all, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur future success also depends in large part on the continued services of senior management and other key personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Tien Tzuo, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is critical to the development of our technology, platform, future vision, and strategic direction. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, marketing, sales, support, and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors on our research and development team. Our senior management and other key personnel are all employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time, for any reason, and without notice. As announced in March 2020, Tyler Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer, will resign from his role effective April 5, 2020. We have established an Office of the CFO consisting of senior finance leaders and have retained a leading recruiting firm to help identify our next CFO. We do not currently maintain key-person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. If we lose the services of senior management or other key personnel, or if we are unable to attract, train, assimilate, and retain the highly skilled personnel we need, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nVolatility or lack of appreciation in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Many of our senior personnel and other key employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase price of the shares or the exercise price of the options, or conversely, if the exercise price of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our Class A common stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, or if we need to increase our compensation expenses to retain our employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAs a substantial portion of our sales efforts are increasingly targeted at large enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become increasingly lengthy and more expensive, we may encounter still greater pricing pressure and deployment and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for more complicated transactions, all of which could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nAs a substantial portion of our sales efforts are increasingly targeted at large enterprise customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles, and less predictability in the completion of some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer\u2019s decision to use our solution may be an enterprise-wide decision, in which case these types of sales frequently require approvals by multiple departments and executive-level personnel and require us to provide greater levels of customer education regarding the uses and benefits of our solution, as well as education regarding security, privacy, and scalability of our solution, especially for those large \u201cbusiness to consumer\u201d customers or those with extensive international operations. These large enterprise transactions might also be part of a customer\u2019s broader business model or business systems transformation project, which are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, security review, and other delays that could further lengthen the sales cycle. Larger enterprises typically have longer decision-making and\ndeployment cycles, may have greater resources to develop and maintain customized tools and applications, demand more customization, require greater functionality and scalability, expect a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, demand increased levels of customer service and support, require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. We are often required to spend time and resources to better familiarize potential customers with the value proposition of our solution. As a result of these factors, sales opportunities with large enterprises may require us to devote greater sales and administrative support and professional services resources to individual customers, which could increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle, and divert our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger customers. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales, design and implementation efforts without being successful in producing any sales or deploying our products in such a way that is satisfactory to our customers. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers. In addition, if sales expected from a large customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, our sales and implementation cycles could be interrupted or affected by other factors outside of our control. For example, we are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impacts on our business. Like many other companies, including our customers and prospects, our employees are working from home and we have limited all non-essential business travel. Restrictions on travel and in-person meetings could affect services delivery, delay implementations, and interrupt sales activity and we cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to grow our sales channels and our relationships with strategic partners, such as GSIs, management consulting firms, and resellers, sales of our products and services may suffer and our growth could be slower than we project.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we use strategic partners, such as GSIs, management consulting firms, and resellers, to market, sell, and implement our solution. Historically, we have used these strategic partners to a limited degree, but we are prioritizing efforts to make these partners an increasingly important aspect of our business particularly with regard to enterprise and international sales and larger implementations of our products where these partners may have more expertise and established business relationships than we do. We expect to transition a portion of our professional services implementations to these strategic partners, and as a result we expect our professional services revenues to decrease over time. Our relationships with these strategic partners are at an early stage of development. We have generated limited revenue through these relationships to date, and we cannot assure you that these partners will be successful in marketing, selling or implementing our solution. Identifying these partners, negotiating and supporting relationships with them, including training them in how to sell or deploy our solution, and maintaining these relationships requires significant commitment of time and resources that may not yield a significant return on our investment in these relationships. Our future growth in revenue and ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends in part on our ability to identify, establish, and retain successful strategic partner relationships in the United States and internationally, which will take significant time and resources and involve significant risk. If we are unable to establish and maintain our relationships with these partners, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe also cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain successful relationships with any strategic partners and, to the extent that our strategic partners are unsuccessful in marketing, selling, or implementing our solution, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our strategic partners may market to our customers the products and services of several different companies, including products and services that compete with our solution. Because our strategic partners do not have an exclusive relationship with us, we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or provide adequate resources to marketing our solution. Moreover, divergence in strategy by any of these partners may materially adversely affect our ability to develop, market, sell, or support our solution. We cannot assure you that our strategic partners will continue to cooperate with us. In addition, actions taken or omitted to be taken by such parties may adversely affect us. We are unable to control the quantity or quality of resources that our systems integrator partners commit to deploying our products and services, or the quality or timeliness of such deployment. If our partners do not commit sufficient or qualified resources to these activities, our customers will be less satisfied, be less supportive with references, or may require the investment of our resources at discounted rates. These, and other failures by our partners to successfully deploy our products and services, may have an adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nErrors, defects, or disruptions in our solution could diminish demand, harm our financial results, and subject us to liability.\nOur customers use our products for important aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects, or disruptions to our solution, or other performance problems with our solution could harm our brand and reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. We are also reliant on third-party software and infrastructure, including the infrastructure of the Internet, to provide our products and services. Any failure of or disruption to this software and infrastructure could also make our solution unavailable to our customers. Our solution is constantly changing with new software releases, which may contain undetected errors when first introduced or released. Any errors, defects, disruptions in service, or other performance problems with our solution could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, delay of payment to us, lower renewal rates, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Accordingly, any errors, defects, or disruptions to our solution could adversely impact our brand and reputation, revenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, because our products and services are designed to interoperate with a variety of internal and third-party systems and infrastructures, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in software technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or resolving interoperability issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with internal or third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, resulting in dissatisfaction of our customers, and may materially and adversely affect our business.\nBecause we typically recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable agreement, a lack of subscription renewals or new subscription agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts, which typically vary between one and three years. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of unearned revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any particular quarter would likely have a minor impact on our revenue results for that quarter, but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solution, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Moreover, our subscription model makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nOur growth forecasts we have provided publicly may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure that our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The forecasts we have provided publicly relating to the expected growth in the subscription billing and revenue recognition industry and ERP software market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in executing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth we have provided publicly should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nThe market for our revenue recognition automation software product, Zuora RevPro, is rapidly evolving as a result of the effectiveness of Topic 606, which makes it difficult to forecast adoption rates and demand for this product, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe began selling Zuora RevPro following our acquisition of Leeyo in May 2017. We have less experience marketing, determining pricing for, and selling Zuora RevPro, and we are still determining how to best market, price, and support adoption of this offering. We have directed, and intend to continue to direct, a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to develop and grow Zuora RevPro. The market for Zuora RevPro is rapidly evolving as a result of the effectiveness of Topic 606, the revenue recognition accounting standard that took effect for most public companies in January 2018. While we have seen a significant number of Zuora RevPro deployments associated with the effectiveness of Topic 606, it is uncertain whether Zuora RevPro will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our future success depends in part upon growth in this market and the\nability of our Zuora RevPro product to meet the demand for revenue recognition automation solutions. We have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for this solution. Companies may choose to purchase our Zuora RevPro product to comply with Topic 606 in the short-term but may develop proprietary solutions in-house or migrate toward other solutions developed by our competitors in the future. Customers may purchase Zuora RevPro as a standalone product and not purchase other core Zuora products. The rapidly evolving nature of this market, as well as other factors that are beyond our control, reduces our ability to accurately evaluate our long-term outlook and forecast annual performance. A reduction or slowdown in demand for revenue recognition automation software, caused by shifts in the marketplace, regulatory requirements, accounting standards, lack of acceptance, technological challenges, and competing solutions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, future growth, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, in the three months ended April 30, 2019, we temporarily slowed down implementations between our Zuora RevPro and Zuora Billing customers due to product integration challenges. This temporary slowdown resulted in lower than expected total revenues for such quarter and resulted in us lowering our financial projections. We resumed the paused customer implementations in late fiscal 2020. Some of our customers are now operationally live on our integrated product, and we continue to work with the remaining customers on their implementation of the integrated product.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to customers located outside of the United States. Our current international operations, and any further expansion of those operations, expose us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe have been recognizing increased revenue from international sales, and we conduct our business activities in various foreign countries. We currently have operations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. During fiscal 2020, we derived approximately 31% of our total revenue from customers located outside the United States. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple cultures, customs, legal systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures. International expansion will require us to invest significant funds and other resources. Our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. Expanding internationally may subject us to new risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n\u2022recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries;\n\u2022providing our solution to customers from different cultures, which may require us to adapt to sales practices, modify our solution, and provide features necessary to effectively serve the local market;\n\u2022compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to employment matters, e-invoicing, consumer protection, privacy, data protection, information security, and encryption;\n\u2022longer sales cycles in some countries;\n\u2022increased third-party costs relating to data centers outside of the United States;\n\u2022generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022weaker privacy and intellectual property protection in some countries, including China and India;\n\u2022compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), and the UK Bribery Act 2010 (UK Bribery Act);\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022tariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, and other trade barriers or protection measures;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n\u2022economic or political instability in countries where we may operate, including the potential effects of Brexit and the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022corporate espionage;\n\u2022compliance with the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions, both foreign and domestic, in which we conduct business, potential double taxation of our international earnings, and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in applicable U.S. and foreign tax laws;\n\u2022continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad;\n\u2022increased costs to establish and maintain effective controls at foreign locations; and\n\u2022overall higher costs of doing business internationally.\nPolitical developments, economic uncertainty or downturns could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPolitical developments impacting government spending and international trade, including future government shutdowns in the United States, continued uncertainty surrounding the final terms of Brexit, political uncertainty in Hong Kong, health pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and trade disputes and tariffs, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions. For example, depending on the final terms of Brexit and formal agreements and arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, we could face new regulatory costs and burdens, including imposition of customs duties, or tariffs, on the sale of our solution to customers in the European Union. We are unable to predict how and to what extent Brexit will impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Brexit could also lead to disruptions to our business in the United Kingdom and Europe, including our relationships with our existing and prospective customers, partners, and employees, and adversely affect expansion of our international operations. The continuing effect of any or all of these political uncertainties could adversely impact demand for our products, harm our operations and weaken our financial results.\nIn addition, in recent years, the United States and other significant markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. Economic uncertainty and associated macroeconomic conditions, including due to pandemics such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause our customers to slow spending on our solution, which could delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore, during uncertain economic times our customers may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our results could be negatively impacted.\nWe have customers in a variety of different industries. A significant downturn in the economic activity attributable to any particular industry may cause organizations to react by reducing their capital and operating expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology. In addition, our customers may delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. To the extent purchases of our solution are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software or modify their legacy business software as an alternative to using our solution. Moreover, competitors may respond to challenging market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or any industry in particular. If the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation will suffer.\nOnce our solution is deployed to our customers, our customers rely on our support services to resolve any related issues. High-quality customer education and customer support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products and for the renewal of existing customers. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new enterprises. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing customer support, our ability to upsell additional products to existing customers could suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers could be harmed.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related\nto unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur customer contracts typically provide for service level commitments, which relate to service uptime, response times, and escalation procedures. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our solution, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits, refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services, or other remedies, or we could face contract terminations. In addition, we could face legal claims for breach of contract, product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Although we have contractual protections, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, in our customer agreements, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims by customers, commercial relationships, or other third parties. We may not be fully indemnified by our vendors for service interruptions beyond our control, and any insurance coverage we may have may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us, or cover only a portion of such claims. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management\u2019s time and other resources. Thus, our revenue could be harmed if we fail to meet our service level commitments under our agreements with our customers, including, but not limited to, maintenance response times and service outages. Typically, we have not been required to provide customers with service credits that have been material to our operating results, but we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs associated with providing service credits to our customers in the future.\nAdditionally, any failure to meet our service level commitments could adversely impact our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAny disruption of service at our third-party data centers or Amazon Web Services could interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our services to our customers.\nWe currently host our solution, serve our customers, and support our operations in the United States primarily from a third-party Las Vegas-based data center and using Amazon Web Services (AWS), a provider of cloud infrastructure services. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our customer data in the Las Vegas-based data center production environment is replicated to an AWS data center outside of the U.S. West Coast. Additionally, in Europe, we host our solution using AWS. We are also in the process of transitioning the hosting of a portion of our U.S. solution infrastructure to AWS, which may be more expensive than our current data center providers. Despite precautions, we may also experience planned and unplanned costs, interruptions, delays, and outages in service or other performance problems in connection with such transition. We also do not have control over the operations of the facilities of our data center providers or AWS. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures, and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our solution. In addition, the current COVID-19 pandemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business. The facilities also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and other misconduct.\nOur solution\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Because our products and services are used by our customers for billing and financial accounting purposes, it is critical that our solution be accessible without interruption or degradation of performance, and we typically provide our customers with service level commitments with respect to service uptime. Customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our solution to them. Outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our customers, in which case, we may not be fully indemnified for such losses pursuant to our agreement with AWS. We may not be able to easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of AWS. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solution to customers and result in contract terminations, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our solution. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.\nNeither our third-party data center providers nor AWS have an obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these providers on commercially reasonable terms, if our agreements with our providers are prematurely terminated, or if in the future we add additional data center providers, we may experience additional costs or service downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new data center providers. If these providers were to increase the cost of their services, we may have to increase the price of our solution, and our operating results may be adversely impacted.\nOur customers and third-party partners often need training in the proper use of our solution to maximize its potential. If our solution is not deployed or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance may result.\nBecause our customers rely on our solution to manage a wide range of subscription management operations, the incorrect or improper deployment or use of our solution, our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our solution, or our failure to provide adequate support to our customers, may result in customers not renewing their subscriptions, customers reducing their use of our solution, negative publicity, or legal claims against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for additional subscriptions to our solution.\nFuture changes in market conditions or customer demand could require changes to our prices or pricing model, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe generally charge our customers a flat fee for their use of our platform and a variable fee based on the amount of transaction volume they process through our system. If our customers do not increase their transaction volume, or an economic downturn reduces their transaction volume, our revenue may be adversely impacted by customers reducing their contracted transaction volume. We have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our platform, and, as a result, we have in the past needed to and expect in the future to need to change our pricing model from time to time. As the market for our platform matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing models as we have used historically. We may experience pressure to change our pricing model to defer fees until our customers have fully deployed our solution. Moreover, larger organizations, which comprise a large and growing component of our sales efforts, may demand substantial price concessions. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or change our pricing model, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nIf we fail to integrate our solution with a variety of operating systems, software applications, and hardware platforms that are developed by others, our solution may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur solution must integrate with a variety of network, hardware, and software platforms, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our solution to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browser, and database technologies. We have developed our solution to be able to integrate with third-party SaaS applications, including the applications of software providers that compete with us, through the use of APIs. For example, Zuora CPQ integrates with certain capabilities of Salesforce using publicly available APIs. In general, we rely on the fact that the providers of such software systems, including Salesforce, continue to allow us access to their APIs to enable these integrations. To date, we have not relied on a long-term written contract to govern our integration relationship with Salesforce. Instead, we are subject to the standard terms and conditions for application developers of Salesforce, which govern the distribution, operation, and fees of applications on the Salesforce platform, and which are subject to change by Salesforce from time to time. We also integrate certain aspects of our solution with other platform providers. Any change or deterioration in our relationship with any platform provider may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if any platform provider:\n\u2022discontinues or limits access to its APIs by us;\n\u2022terminates or does not allow us to renew or replace our contractual relationship;\n\u2022modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or changes how customer information is accessed by us or our customers;\n\u2022establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors, or acquires one or more of our competitors or is acquired by a competitor and offers competing services to us; or\n\u2022otherwise develops its own competitive offerings.\nIn addition, we have benefited from these platform providers\u2019 brand recognition, reputations, and customer bases. Any losses or shifts in the market position of these platform providers in general, in relation to one another or to new competitors or new technologies could lead to losses in our relationships or customers, or to our need to identify or transition to alternative channels for marketing our solutions. Such changes could consume substantial\nresources and may not be effective. If we are unable to respond to changes in a cost-effective manner, our solution may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete and our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand and reputation cost-effectively, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing awareness and integrity of our brand and reputation in a cost-effective manner are important to achieving widespread acceptance of our solution and are important elements in attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. We believe that the importance of our brand and reputation will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Successful promotion of our brand and the Subscription Economy concept will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide a reliable and useful solution at competitive prices, the perceived value of our solution, and our ability to provide quality customer support. In addition, the promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets, and as more sales are generated through our strategic partners. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building and maintaining our brand and reputation. We also rely on our customer base and community of end-users in a variety of ways, including to give us feedback on our solution and to provide user-based support to our other customers. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand successfully or to maintain loyalty among our customers, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract new customers and partners or retain our existing customers and partners and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any negative publicity relating to our customers, employees, partners, or others associated with these parties, may also tarnish our own reputation simply by association and may reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our brand and reputation may result in reduced demand for our solution and increased risk of losing market share to our competitors. Any efforts to restore the value of our brand and rebuild our reputation may be costly and may not be successful.\nOur customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to compel payment.\nWe typically enter into non-cancelable agreements with our customers with a term of one to three years. If customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. The risk of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements. Furthermore, some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial position, and cash flow.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe are currently involved in stockholder litigation and have in the past and may in the future become involved in other class actions, derivative actions, private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies, or others. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and contractual arrangements, to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur pending patent or trademark applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of our patents, copyrights, trademarks or the trade secret status of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance that additional patents will be issued or that any patents that are issued will provide significant protection for our intellectual property. There is also no assurance that we will be able to register\ntrademarks that are critical to our business. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. There is no assurance that the particular forms of intellectual property protection that we seek, including business decisions about when to file patents and when to maintain trade secrets, will be adequate to protect our business.\nMoreover, recent amendments to U.S. patent law, developing jurisprudence regarding U.S. patent law, and possible future changes to U.S. or foreign patent laws and regulations may affect our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our solution and proprietary information will likely increase. Despite our precautions, our intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft, and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches. It may be possible for third parties to infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property, to copy our solution, and to use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our solution is available. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property rights domestically or internationally, which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international expansion. Moreover, we may not pursue or file patent applications or apply for registration of copyrights or trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate with respect to our potentially patentable inventions, works of authorship, marks and logos for a variety of reasons, including the cost of procuring such rights and the uncertainty involved in obtaining adequate protection from such applications and registrations. If we cannot adequately protect and defend our intellectual property, we may not remain competitive, and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, use of, and distribution of our proprietary information or in effectively securing exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed by our current or former employees and consultants. Further, these agreements may not prevent other parties from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our solution.\nWe may need to spend significant resources securing and monitoring our intellectual property rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims attacking the scope, validity, and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, or with counterclaims and countersuits asserting infringement by our products and services of third-party intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and our business.\nAdditionally, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions in order to complete the patent or trademark application process and to maintain issued patents or trademarks. There are situations in which noncompliance or non-payment can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or trademark or associated application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent or trademark rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nWe are vulnerable to intellectual property infringement claims brought against us by others.\nThere has been considerable activity in our industry to develop and enforce intellectual property rights. Successful intellectual property infringement claims against us or certain third parties, such as our customers, resellers, or strategic partners, could result in monetary liability or a material disruption in the conduct of our business. We cannot be certain that our products and services, content, and brand names do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be subject to\nlegal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to cease selling or using solutions that incorporate the intellectual property that we allegedly infringe, make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages, obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology, or redesign the allegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible. Any claims or litigation, regardless of merit, could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our products and services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We do not have a significant patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or strategic partners in connection with such infringement claims, or to obtain licenses from third parties or modify our solution, and each such obligation could further exhaust our resources. Some of our IP infringement indemnification obligations are contractually capped at a very high amount or not capped at all.\nEven if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and attention of our management and other employees, and adversely affect our business and operating results. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for subscription management products and services grows. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our software, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur software incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools from third parties in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, including open source software, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to migrate to other third-party software. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties. In addition, integration of our software with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, any undetected or uncorrected errors or defects in third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software, present security risks, delay new updates or enhancements to our solution, result in a failure of our solution, and injure our reputation.\nOur solution contains open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying licenses could restrict our ability to sell our solution.\nOur solution incorporates certain open source software. An open source license typically permits the use, modification, and distribution of software in source code form subject to certain conditions. Some open source licenses contain conditions that any person who distributes or uses a modification or derivative work of software that was subject to an open source license make the modified version subject to the same open source license. Distributing or using software that is subject to this kind of open source license can lead to a requirement that certain aspects of our solution be distributed or made available in source code form. Although we do not believe that we have used open source software in a manner that might condition its use on our distribution of any portion of our solution in source code form, the interpretation of open source licenses is legally complex and, despite our efforts, it is possible that we may be liable for copyright infringement, breach of contract, or other claims if our use of open source software is adjudged to not comply with the applicable open source licenses.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our solution will be effective. If we have not complied with the terms of an applicable open source software license, we may need to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our solution on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our solution to remove or replace the open source software, to discontinue the sale of our solution if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, to pay monetary damages, or to make available the source code for aspects of our proprietary technology, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, use of open source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, assurances of title, performance, non-infringement, or controls on the origin of the software. There is typically no support available for open source software, and we cannot assure you that the authors of such open source software will not abandon further development and maintenance. Open source software may contain security vulnerabilities, and we may be subject to additional security risk by using open source software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our solution.\nWe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or to achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions. We may acquire or invest in additional companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nOur business strategy may, from time to time, include acquiring other complementary products, technologies, or businesses. For example, in May 2017, we acquired Leeyo. An acquisition, investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired companies choose not to work for us, if an acquired company\u2019s software is not easily adapted to work with ours, or if we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. For example, during the three months ended April 30, 2019, we experienced product integration challenges and consequently temporarily slowed down our implementations in that period between our Zuora Billing and Zuora RevPro customers. We resumed the paused customer implementations in late fiscal 2020. Some of our customers are now operationally live on our integrated product, and we continue to work with the remaining customers on their implementation of the integrated product.\nAcquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, technologies, or other assets. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products and services or our ability to provide our products and services in foreign jurisdictions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing, or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close. For one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u2022encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business cultures; and\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges.\nAny of these risks could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nIf we are not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements, our growth could be harmed.\nWe are subject to data protection, security, privacy, and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require us to notify individuals of data security and privacy incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security and privacy compromises experienced by us or our service providers may lead to public disclosures, which could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security and privacy measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to\nrenew their subscriptions with us, or negatively impact our employee relationships or impair our ability to attract new employees. In addition, some of the industries we serve have industry-specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security, privacy and regulatory standards, such as those required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. We also maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is critical to the financial services and insurance industries. As we expand and sell into new verticals and regions, we will likely need to comply with these and other requirements to compete effectively. If we cannot comply or if we incur a violation in one or more of these requirements, our growth could be adversely impacted, and we could incur significant liability.\nPrivacy and security concerns and laws, or other domestic or foreign regulations, may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business.\nOur customers can use our solution to collect, use, and store personal or identifying information regarding their customers or other end users. National and local governments and agencies in the countries in which we operate and in which our customers operate have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, data residency, processing, and disclosure of information obtained from consumers and other individuals, which could impact our ability to offer our products and services in certain jurisdictions or our customers\u2019 ability to deploy our solution globally. Laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, security, and other processing of individuals\u2019 information can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The European Union and many countries, including China and India, as well as states within the United States, such as California, have in place or are enacting stricter laws and regulations relating to privacy and data collection. We also may be bound by contractual obligations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security that are more stringent than applicable laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are significant. In addition, some companies, particularly larger or global enterprises, often will not contract with vendors that do not meet these rigorous standards and often seek contract terms to ensure we are financially liable for any breach of laws or regulations. Accordingly, our failure, or perceived inability, to comply with these laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations may limit the use and adoption of our solution, reduce overall demand for our solution, lead to regulatory investigations, breach of contract claims, litigation, and significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, if we or any of our employees or contractors fail or are believed to fail to adhere to appropriate practices regarding our customers\u2019 data, it may damage our reputation and brand.\nAdditionally, we expect that existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations may be interpreted in new and differing manners in the future, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations could result in increased regulation, increased costs of compliance and penalties for non-compliance, costly changes to Zuora's products or their functionality, and limitations on data collection, use, disclosure, and transfer for us and our customers. The European Union and United States agreed in 2016 to a framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but this framework has been challenged by private parties and may face additional challenges by national regulators or additional private parties. Additionally, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in May 2018. The GDPR establishes, and the pending European Union ePrivacy Regulation is expected to establish, new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. Additionally, in January 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and contains new operational requirements for companies, went into effect. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, CCPA and other U.S., European Union, China (including the Cybersecurity Law of China) and foreign laws currently in existence or that may be passed in the future, may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to process, handle, store, use, and transmit certain types of information, such as demographic and other personal information, of their customers using our solution, which could limit the use, effectiveness, and adoption of our solution and reduce overall demand. In addition, the other bases on which we and our customers rely for the transfer of personal data across national borders, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses promulgated by the EU Commission Decision 2010/87/EU, commonly referred to as the Model Clauses, continue to be subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. We have taken steps in our privacy compliance efforts to\naddress the United Kingdom's departure in January 2020 from the European Union (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). The United Kingdom implemented the Data Protection Act, effective in May 2018 and statutorily amended in 2019, that substantially implements the GDPR. Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the requirements for data transfers between the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and the ability to conduct business and transfer personal data between the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries may be negatively impacted due to circumstances beyond our control, including ongoing uncertainty regarding the final terms of Brexit and formal agreements or arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, changes in laws and enforcement, or the time and costs to put in place new bases on which we and our customers can rely for the transfer of personal data. If we or our customers are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could decrease demand for our solution, require us to modify or restrict our solution, products, services, or operations, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. With respect to any changes we consider necessary or appropriate to make to our solution, products, services, or practices in an effort to comply, or allow our customers to comply, with laws, regulations, or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, we may be unable to make those changes in a commercially reasonable manner, in a timely fashion, or at all. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit the adoption, effectiveness, or use of our solution.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups, the technology industry, and other industries have established or may establish various new, additional, or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by them or third parties, and we may be required or otherwise find it advisable to obtain these certifications or adhere to these standards. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our solution and adversely affect our business.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the UK Bribery Act, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from promising, authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we use various third parties to sell our solution and conduct our business abroad. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We have implemented an anti-corruption compliance program but cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, significant defense costs, and other professional fees.\nWe are required to comply with governmental export control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur solution is subject to governmental, including United States and European Union, export control laws and import regulations, and as a U.S. company we are covered by the U.S. sanctions regulations. U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, entities and persons, and complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. While we take precautions to prevent our solution from being exported in violation of these laws or\nengaging in any other activities that are subject to these regulations, if we were to fail to comply with U.S. export laws, U.S. Customs regulations and import regulations, U.S. economic sanctions, and other countries\u2019 import and export laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for the company, incarceration for responsible employees and managers; the possible loss of export or import privileges which could impact our ability to provide our solution to customers; and reputational harm.\nWe incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products and certain encryption products may be exported outside of the United States only by a license or a license exception. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to deploy our products in those countries. Although we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided in violation of such laws, we cannot assure you that inadvertent violations of such laws have not occurred or will not occur in connection with the distribution of our products despite the precautions we take. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nFurther, if our partners, including suppliers, fail to obtain required import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be harmed, become the subject of government investigations or penalties, and incur reputational harm. Changes in our solution or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solution in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solution globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws or regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could result in decreased use of our solution by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solution to, existing or potential customers such as customers with international operations or customers who are added to the restricted entities list published by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Any decreased use of our solution or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solution would likely harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to increased tax liability.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act), although the treatment of tax losses generated in taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. This change may require us to pay more federal income taxes in future years than we would have had to pay under pre-existing law. In addition, the Tax Reform Act's new \"base erosion and anti-abuse tax\" or \"BEAT\" may require us to pay additional federal income taxes even in years when we are not profitable.\nThe applicability of sales, use and other tax laws or regulations in the U.S. and internationally on our business is uncertain. Adverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could subject us to additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, increase the costs of our services and adversely impact our business.\nThe application of federal, state, local, and non-U.S. tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use, value-added, or other direct or indirect tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the Internet or could otherwise materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, state, local, and foreign tax jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, and these rules and regulations can be complex and are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. For example, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2018 could result in more states requiring us to collect sales or use tax on sales we make to their residents. Existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on prior sales and going forward, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. Although our\ncustomer contracts typically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes, our customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and associated interest or penalties, or we may determine that it would not be commercially feasible to seek reimbursement. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties, or we are unsuccessful in collecting such amounts from our customers, we could incur potentially substantial unplanned expenses, thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows. Imposition of such taxes on our services going forward could also adversely affect our sales activity and have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, the results of our operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we expect an increasing number of sales contracts to be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the future, the majority of our sales contracts have historically been denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, most of our revenue has not been subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our solution to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our operating results. Although we may in the future decide to undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure, we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors' confidence in us.\nAny difficulties in implementing new accounting pronouncements, such as those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nCertain of our operating results and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced significant seasonality with respect to our subscription revenue throughout the year, we have seen seasonality in our sales cycle as a large percentage of our customers make their purchases in the third month of any given quarter. In addition, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter. We believe that this results in part from the procurement, budgeting, and deployment cycles of many of our customers. We generally expect a relative increase in sales in the second half of each year as budgets of our customers for annual capital purchases are being fully utilized. We may be affected by seasonal trends in the future, particularly as our business matures. Such seasonality may result from a number of factors, including a slowdown in our customers\u2019 procurement process during certain times of the year, both domestically and internationally, and customers choosing to spend remaining budgets shortly before the end of their fiscal years. These effects may become more pronounced as we target larger organizations and their larger budgets for sales of our solution. Additionally, this seasonality may be reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes may not be immediately apparent, in our revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable subscription agreement. In addition, our ability to record professional services revenue can potentially vary based on the number of billable days in the given quarter, which is impacted by holidays and vacations. To the extent we experience this seasonality, it may cause fluctuations in our operating results and financial metrics and make forecasting our future operating results and financial metrics more difficult.\nWe may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIn order to support our growth and respond to business challenges, such as developing new features or enhancements to our solution to stay competitive, acquiring new technologies, and improving our infrastructure, we have made significant financial investments in our business, and we intend to continue to make such investments. As a result, to provide the funds required for these investments and other business endeavors, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings, in addition to any indebtedness we may have under our then current debt arrangements. If we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and these securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our common stock. If we obtain additional funds through debt financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us. Such terms may involve additional restrictive covenants making it difficult to engage in capital raising activities and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and our business may be adversely affected, requiring us to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of our operations.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain additional executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. We expect compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company (EGC). The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees and outside consultants to comply with these requirements, we may need to add additional resources, which would increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to public companies make it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we have reduced flexibility and are under pressure to focus on short-term results, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve long-term profitability.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nThis report will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. Because we are no longer an EGC as of January 31, 2020, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our independent registered public accounting firm to annually attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with this Form 10-K, which has required, and will continue to require, increased costs, expenses, and management resources. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken, and may need to further undertake in the future, various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, including as a result of any identified material weakness, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nMost members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the significant regulatory and reporting requirements of a public company under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur corporate \u201cZEO\u201d culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that our entrepreneurial corporate culture has been a key contributor to our success. We have worked to develop what we call our \u201cZEO\u201d culture, which is based on the idea that each employee is the CEO of their job and career, and we strive to empower every employee to make and own their decisions and contributions to the company. If we do not continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve, including maintaining a culture that encourages individual entrepreneurship by our employees, it could harm our ability to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe that we need to support our growth. We expect to continue to hire as we expand. As our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively impact our future success.\nOur Debt Agreement provides our lender with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur Debt Agreement restricts our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022declare dividends or make certain distributions; and\n\u2022undergo a merger or consolidation or other transactions.\nOur Debt Agreement also prohibits us from exceeding an adjusted quick ratio. Our ability to comply with this and other covenants is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants or payment requirements, or the occurrence of other events specified in our Debt Agreement could result in an event of default under the Debt Agreement which would give our lender the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under the Debt Agreement and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, we have granted our lender first-priority liens against substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, as collateral. Failure to comply with the covenants or other restrictions in the Debt Agreement could result in a default. If the debt under our Debt Agreement was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe stock price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Since shares of our Class A were sold in our Initial Public Offering (IPO) in April 2018 at a price of $14.00 per share, the reported low and high sales prices of our common stock has ranged from $6.21 to $37.78, through March 27, 2020. We experienced a significant decline in our stock price following our announcement of earnings for the quarter ended April 30, 2019. The market price of our Class A common stock and the market price of the common stock of many other companies have fallen significantly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which, and for how long, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the market price of our Class A common stock is unclear, and the market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and any associated economic downturn. In addition to factors discussed in this Form 10-Q, the market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u2022changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022negative publicity related to the real or perceived quality of our solution, as well as the failure to timely launch new products and services that gain market acceptance;\n\u2022growth of the Subscription Economy;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new products, commercial relationships, or significant technical innovations;\n\u2022acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us, litigation involving our industry, or both;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our or other parties\u2019 products, services, or intellectual property rights;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from pandemics, war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and\n\u2022sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, and technology companies in particular, have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted shareholder litigation following periods of market volatility. We are currently subject to stockholder litigation, which is described in Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. This or any future shareholder litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline and may make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market. The perception that these sales might occur may also cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. As of February 29, 2020, we had outstanding a total of 97.7 million shares of Class A common stock and 17.3 million shares of Class B common stock.\nIn addition, as of January 31, 2020, we had outstanding stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) that could result in the issuance of 18.7 million shares of Class A common stock. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding RSUs will be available for immediate resale in the open market.\nMoreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders.\nWe may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments, or otherwise. We also expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (2018 Plan) and rights to purchase our Class A common stock under our ESPP. Any such issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, including our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, which limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January 31, 2020, our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, held a majority of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) April 16, 2028, and (iii) the date the shares of Class B common stock cease to represent at least 5% of all outstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In\naddition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain permitted transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.\nStock index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell, exclude or limit the eligibility of public companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock for certain indices, including the S&P 500. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our Class A common stock could be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nEven if our stock is actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future results. For example, in order to assess our business activity in a given period, analysts and investors may look at the combination of revenue and changes in deferred revenue in a given period (sometimes referred to as \u201cbillings\u201d). Over-reliance on billings or similar measures may result in analyst or investor forecasts that differ significantly from our own for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022a relatively large number of transactions occur at the end of the quarter. Invoicing of those transactions may or may not occur before the end of the quarter based on a number of factors including receipt of information from the customer, volume of transactions, and holidays. A shift of a few days has little economic impact on our business, but will shift deferred revenue from one period into the next;\n\u2022a shift in billing frequency (i.e. from monthly to quarterly or from quarterly to annually), which may distort trends;\n\u2022subscriptions that have deferred start dates; and\n\u2022services that are invoiced upon delivery.\nIn addition, the new revenue recognition standard, Topic 606, has introduced new and significant disclosure requirements. These disclosure obligations are prepared on the basis of estimates that can change over time and on the basis of events over which we have no control. It is possible that analysts and investors may misinterpret our disclosure or that our methods for estimating this disclosure may differ significantly from others, which could lead to inaccurate or unfavorable forecasts by analysts and investors.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by restrictions under the terms of our Debt Agreement. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors\nmust rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022provide that our Board of Directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022permit the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board of Directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022provide that only the chairman of our Board of Directors, our chief executive officer, lead independent director, or a majority of our Board of Directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by (i) the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court and (ii) the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder can be brought in either federal or state court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17382, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ZUO"}
