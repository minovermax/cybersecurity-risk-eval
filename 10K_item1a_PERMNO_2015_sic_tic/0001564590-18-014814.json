{"cik": "1497253", "company": "ORGANOVO HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-05-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvestment in our common stock involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. As a result, the purchase of our common stock should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford to lose their entire investment. Before you elect to purchase our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information incorporated herein by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or which we currently believe are immaterial could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses, and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.\nWe were incorporated in 2007, and opened our laboratories in San Diego, California in January 2009. Since our incorporation, we have focused primarily on the development of our platform technology and the development of our biological research, drug discovery and therapeutic products and services based on that technology. We announced the initiation of contracting for our ExVive\u2122 Human Liver Tissue and ExVive\u2122 Human Kidney services in November 2014 and September 2016, respectively, for use in toxicology and other preclinical drug testing. We only recently began focusing on offering our tissues to support in vitro disease modeling. Because of our limited commercial operating history, investors have limited historical financial or other information upon which to base an evaluation of our performance and future prospects. Moreover, our future prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations and competing in new and rapidly developing technology areas. Additionally, our therapeutic tissue programs are in the early stages of development, and there is no assurance if or when we will obtain the required regulatory approvals to be marketing a therapeutic product. We have generated operating losses each year since we began operations, including $35.3 million, $38.6 million and $38.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, we had incurred cumulative operating losses of $181.1 million and cumulative net losses totaling $234.1 million. We expect to incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as our research, development, regulatory and commercial activities increase. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing the required preclinical and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our therapeutic tissue program;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully developing drug discovery, biological research, and therapeutic tools, products and services that are more effective than existing technologies and can be offered at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing studies and providing the technical information required to support market acceptance of our products, services and technology;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing our existing collaborative agreements, and entering into new collaborative relationships;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully developing an effective sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our products and services;\n\u2022\nentering into successful manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing arrangements with third parties; and\n\u2022\nraising sufficient funds to finance our activities and long-term business plan.\nWe might not succeed at any of these undertakings. If we are unsuccessful at one or more of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are an early-stage company with an unproven business strategy, and may never achieve profitability.\nWe are in the early stages of using our proprietary platform technology to develop and commercialize functional human tissues that can be employed in drug discovery and development and in biological research. We are also in the early stages of developing and completing preclinical studies for our first therapeutic liver tissue candidate, which focuses on a rare disease known as Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (\u201cA1AT\u201d). Our success will depend upon the commercial adoption of our platform technology, as well as on our ability to determine which drug discovery, biological research, and therapeutic tools, products and services can be successfully developed and commercialized with our platform technology. Our success will also depend on our ability to increase customer awareness and demand for our products and services, to enter into additional collaboration agreements on favorable terms and to select an appropriate commercialization strategy for the products and services we or our collaborators choose to pursue. Additionally, our success will depend on our ability to successfully develop, complete preclinical and clinical studies and eventually obtain regulatory approval for any therapeutic tissue candidates we elect to pursue. If we are not successful in implementing our product development, regulatory and commercialization strategies, which are new and unproven, and/or if we underprice or overrun our cost estimates for our contracts or our development, regulatory and commercialization activities, we may never achieve profitability, or even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate our future revenues and operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls, and require us to secure additional financing sooner than planned.\nWe may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues and our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nour expectations regarding revenues from sales of our products and services, and from collaborations with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost of developing, completing preclinical and clinical studies and obtaining required regulatory approvals for the therapeutic tissue candidates we elect to pursue;\n\u2022\nthe time and resources required to develop our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services;\n\u2022\nthe cost and time to pursue additional research and development programs as part of our long-term business plan;\n\u2022\nthe cost and time required to create effective sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization strategies;\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur to maintain and improve our platform technology;\n\u2022\nthe cost and time to satisfy unique customer requirements regarding validation studies and/or cell sourcing;\n\u2022\nthe costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation.\nIn addition, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our products and services, and from collaborations with third parties. However, we may not correctly predict the amount or timing of future revenues. In addition, we may not correctly estimate the costs and time required to develop, complete preclinical and clinical studies and obtain regulatory approval for our therapeutic tissue candidates. We may not be able to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our revenues or any increase in our expenses as part of implementing our long-term business plan. As a result, a significant shortfall in our planned revenues or a significant increase in our planned expenses could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In such case, we may be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial arrangements, including relationships with corporate and other partners, sooner than anticipated to secure the additional financial resources to support our development efforts and future operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as:\n\u2022\nthe results of our development and regulatory approval progress for our therapeutic tissue candidates;\n\u2022\nour reported revenues and financial results;\n\u2022\nthe number and scope of ongoing client engagements and collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe commencement, postponement, delay, progress, completion, or cancellation of client contracts or collaborations in the quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the general global economy\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nthe extent of cost overruns or delays in our product development and regulatory approval plans;\n\u2022\nholiday buying patterns of our clients;\n\u2022\nbudget cycles of our clients;\nWe believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. Nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe will require significant additional financing to support our long-term business plans.\nWe have used significant funds to develop our current bioprinting technologies, products and services and our tissue platform development and commercialization infrastructure. We will require additional funds to support our long-term business plans, including the development and regulatory approval process for any therapeutic tissue candidates we elect to pursue. We expect that we will be required to issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into other commercial arrangements, including relationships with corporate and other partners, to secure the additional financial resources to support our development and regulatory approval efforts and to implement our long-term business plans. Depending upon market conditions, we may not be successful in raising sufficient additional capital on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, the issuance of additional equity securities, including securities convertible into or exercisable for our equity securities, would result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. If we fail to obtain sufficient additional financing, or enter into relationships with others that provide additional financial resources, we may not be able to develop our technology and products or complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to obtain required regulatory approval for any therapeutic tissue candidate in accordance with our long-term business plan, and we may be required to delay significantly, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, or seek alternative measures to raise additional funds.\nOur current therapeutic product candidate portfolio is in the early stages of development.\nWe are in the early stages of developing potential therapeutic products based on our proprietary technology. In October 2016, we announced our plan to develop 3D bioprinted human liver tissue for direct transplantation to patients. This therapeutic program is in the early stages of preclinical development. The results of our future preclinical studies on our therapeutic liver tissue may be different from our existing studies and preclinical results, and may not support further clinical development of this therapeutic product candidate. Moreover, we have not finalized the design of the preclinical studies required to support an IND submission for our first liver therapeutic tissue indication, A1AT. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining FDA approval of our IND submission, or that our future preclinical studies will support the filling of an IND for our therapeutic tissue candidate. Further, we may not successfully complete the required preclinical and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our therapeutic liver tissue on a timely basis, or at all. Similarly, there is no assurance that we can successfully identify and develop additional therapeutic product candidates, prove that they are safe and efficacious in clinical trials, or meet applicable regulatory standards. We do not currently have sufficient resources to complete the clinical development of our therapeutic liver tissue or any other therapeutic tissue candidate we identify, and as a result, we will need to raise additional funds or pursue licensing, partnering and other strategic alternatives. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so based on their early stage of development of our therapeutic liver tissue and any other therapeutic tissue candidates we identify. As a result, we may not be successful in developing, showing clinical efficacy, obtaining regulatory approval or raising the required capital for our therapeutic liver tissue or any therapeutic programs we identify and elect to pursue.\nIf testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results, then we will be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to commercialize that product candidate.\nWe must demonstrate our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy in humans through extensive clinical testing. Our research and development programs are at an early stage of development. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the testing process that could delay or prevent us from obtaining the regulatory approvals required to commercialization of any of our product candidates, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials;\n\u2022\nafter reviewing test results, we may abandon projects that we might previously have believed to be promising;\n\u2022\nwe or our regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials because the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved.\nWe may not enjoy the market exclusivity benefits of our orphan drug designation.\nAlthough we may obtain orphan designations in the treatment of certain diseases our therapeutic products are intended to treat, the designation may not be applicable to any particular product we might get approved and that product may not be the first product to receive approval for that indication. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the first product with an orphan drug designation receives market exclusivity, which prohibits the FDA from approving the \u201csame\u201d drug for the same indication. The FDA has stated that drugs can be the \u201csame\u201d even when they are not identical, but has not provided guidance with respect to how it will determine \u201csameness\u201d in the context of 3D bioprinted tissues. It is possible that another bioprinted therapeutic tissue product could be approved for the treatment of a disease one of our orphan products is intended to treat before our product is approved, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval until the first product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity for a product expires or we demonstrate, if we can, that our product is superior. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOur platform technology and our drug discovery, biological research, therapeutic tools, products and services are new and unproven.\nOur platform technology, as well as our drug discovery, biological research, therapeutic tools, products and services, involve new and unproven models and approaches. We only began offering our first commercial product (and related research services), our ExVive\u2122 Human Liver Tissue, on a limited basis in April 2014 and more broadly in November 2014. We only began offering our second product (and related research services), our ExVive\u2122 Human Kidney Tissue, for predictive preclinical testing of drug compounds in September 2016. We only recently begin focusing on offering our tissues to support in vitro disease modeling. As a result, we have had a limited time to prove that our ExVive\u2122 Human Liver Tissue and ExVive\u2122 Human Kidney Tissue and related services will enable our customers to conduct drug discovery and biological research, including disease modeling, more effectively than through the use of existing technologies. Our commercial products reflect a novel approach to preclinical testing of drug compounds and disease modeling, and there is no assurance that they will perform as expected or as required by our customers. Our success depends on the commercial acceptance of, and the success of our efforts to increase customer awareness and demand for, our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services. Some of our customers may require unique features, cell sourcing, or validation data in order to utilize our commercial products in their drug discovery, biological research or development programs. Even if we or our collaborators are successful in our respective efforts, we or our collaborators may not be able to discover or develop commercially viable therapeutics or other products therefrom. If our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services do not assist in the discovery and development of such therapeutic products or to model diseases, our current and potential collaborators may lose confidence in us and our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services. Our inability to successfully develop effective and competitive drug discovery, biological research, tools, products and services and achieve and maintain commercial acceptance for those tools, products and services would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur technology, products and services are subject to the risks associated with new and rapidly evolving technologies and industries.\nOur proprietary tissue creation technology and our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services and our therapeutic tissue candidates are subject to the risks associated with new, rapidly evolving technologies and industries. We may experience unforeseen technical complications, unrecognized defects and limitations in the development and commercialization of our tools, products and services, including our ExVive\u2122 Human Liver and ExVive\u2122 Kidney Tissues. Similarly, we may experience unforeseen difficulties in developing our therapeutic tissue candidates. In addition, our customers may request cell sources, validation studies, or features not included in our standard commercial tissue products. These complications could materially delay or limit customer demand for and use of those tools, products and services, substantially increase the anticipated cost of manufacturing, or prevent us or our collaborators from implementing their drug discovery or biological research projects successfully or at all. In addition, the process of developing new technologies, products and services is complex, and if we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing products and services or acceptable new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, customer requirements, or industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize the drug discovery, biological research, and therapeutic tools, products and services we develop is subject to a variety of risks.\nThe commercialization of our drug discovery, biological research and therapeutic tools, products and services are subject to risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nfailing to develop products or services that are effective and competitive;\n\u2022\nfailing to demonstrate the commercial and technical viability of any products or services that we successfully develop, failing to meet customer expectations or requirements or otherwise failing to achieve market acceptance of such products or services;\n\u2022\nfailing to be cost effective and timely;\n\u2022\nfailing to successfully complete preclinical and clinical studies and obtain any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to implement features or functionality required by customers;\n\u2022\nbeing difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to establish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with reliable third parties;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to obtain a sufficient supply of human cells for our products, services and research and development activities on a timely basis and at acceptable quality levels and costs;\n\u2022\nfailing to develop our products and services before the successful marketing of similar products and services by competitors;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to hire and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\ninfringing the proprietary rights of third parties or competing with superior products marketed by third parties.\nIf any of these or any other risks and uncertainties occur, our efforts to commercialize our drug discovery and biological research tools, products and services may be unsuccessful, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nThe near and long-term viability of our products and services will depend on our ability to successfully establish new strategic relationships.\nThe near and long-term viability of our products and services will depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, universities, hospitals, insurance companies and government agencies. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our technology or product offerings or our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of new collaborations on acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts. Even if we establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any product or service candidates for several reasons both within and outside of our control.\nWe cannot control our collaborators\u2019 allocation of resources or the amount of time that our collaborators devote to developing our programs or potential products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur existing research and collaboration agreements may allow our collaborators to obtain the options to license or exclusive rights to negotiate licenses to our new technologies. Our collaborators may have significant discretion in electing whether to pursue product development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing of the products they may develop with the help of our technology. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborators may devote to our programs or potential products. As a result, we cannot be certain that our collaborators will choose to develop and commercialize products utilizing our technology or that we will realize any future milestone payments, royalties and other payments provided for in the agreements with our collaborators. In addition, if a collaborator is involved in a business combination, such as a merger or acquisition, or if a collaborator changes its business focus, its performance pursuant to its agreement with us may suffer. As a result, we may not generate any revenues from royalty, milestone and similar provisions that may be included in our collaborative agreements.\nIn addition, our collaborative partners or other customers that utilize our research tools will be required to submit their research for regulatory review in order to proceed with human testing of drug candidates. This review by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may result in timeline setbacks or complete rejection of an application to begin human studies, such as an Investigative New Drug (IND) application, or the ultimate failure to receive the regulatory approval required to commercialize the drug candidate or product. Should our collaborative partners or other customers face such setbacks, we would be at risk of not earning any future milestone or royalty payments.\nAny termination or breach by or conflict with our collaborators or licensees could harm our business.\nOur research and collaboration agreements typically involve various stages in which our collaborators can make a \u201cgo\u201d or \u201cno-go\u201d decision in determining whether to continue their collaboration with us. If we or any of our existing or future collaborators or licensees fail to renew or terminate any of our collaboration or license agreements, or if either party fails to satisfy its obligations under any of our collaboration or license agreements or complete them in a timely manner, we could lose significant sources of revenue, which could result in volatility in our future revenues. In addition, our agreements with our collaborators and licensees may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could lead to termination of the agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply or commercialization of certain products, or could require or result in litigation or arbitration. Moreover, disagreements could arise with our collaborators over rights to our intellectual property or our rights to share in any of the future revenues of products developed by our collaborators. These kinds of disagreements could result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Any such conflicts with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and could have a negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators, adversely affecting our business and revenues. Finally, any of our collaborations or license agreements may prove to be unsuccessful.\nOur collaborators could develop competing research tools or services, reducing the available pool of potential collaborators and increasing competition, which may adversely affect our business and revenues.\nOur collaborators and potential collaborators could develop in vitro research tools similar to our own, reducing our pool of possible collaborative parties and increasing competition. Any of these developments could harm our commercialization efforts, which could seriously harm our business. In addition, we may pursue opportunities in fields that could conflict with those of our collaborators. Developing products and services that compete with our collaborators\u2019 or potential collaborators\u2019 products and services could preclude us from entering into future collaborations with our collaborators or potential collaborators. Any of these developments could harm our product development efforts and could adversely affect our business and revenues.\nWe face intense competition which could result in reduced acceptance and demand for our products and services.\nThe biotechnology industry is subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise in the following areas than we do:\n\u2022\nresearch and technology development;\n\u2022\nproduct identification and development;\n\u2022\nregulatory processes and approvals;\n\u2022\nproduction and manufacturing;\n\u2022\nsecuring government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nsales and marketing of products, services and technologies; and\n\u2022\nidentifying and entering into agreements with potential collaborators.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our industry include the quality, scientific and technical support, price and breadth of technology and services; management and the execution of product development and commercialization strategies; skill and experience of employees, including the ability to recruit and retain skilled, experienced employees; intellectual property portfolio; range of capabilities, including product identification, development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing; and the availability of substantial capital resources to fund these activities. Please see the \u201cCompetition\u201d section of Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d for a further description of the competition for our products and services, including the identity of certain of our significant competitors.\nIn order to effectively compete, we will need to make substantial investments in our research and technology development, product identification and development, testing and regulatory approval, manufacturing, customer awareness activities, publications of our technology and results in scientific publications and sales and marketing activities. There is no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing and gaining significant market share for any products or services we offer in part through use of our technology. Our technologies, products and services also may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive as a result of products and services introduced by our competitors.\nWe may have product liability exposure from the sale of our research tools and therapeutic products or the services we provide.\nWe may have exposure to claims for product liability. Product liability coverage is expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. There can be no assurance that our existing insurance coverage will extend to other products in the future. Our product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities resulting from product liability claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable items, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time-consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace, and would likely divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe may be dependent on third-party research organizations to conduct some of our future laboratory testing, animal and human studies.\nWe may be dependent on third-party research organizations to conduct some of our laboratory testing, animal and human studies with respect to therapeutic tissues and other life science products that we may develop in the future. If we are unable to obtain any necessary testing services on acceptable terms, we may not complete our product development or regulatory approval efforts in a timely manner. If we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and/or animal and human studies, we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties. These third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we so request. We may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our laboratory testing and/or animal and human studies. We are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our general plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our future product candidates.\nWe will require access to a constant, steady, reliable supply of human cells to successfully develop and commercialize our tools and products.\nWe require a reliable supply of qualified human cells for our commercial products and services and for our research and product development activities. We purchase certain qualified human cells from selected third-party suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and regulatory requirements. We formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara, to eventually serve as a key source of the primary human cells we utilize in our business. We intend to utilize a combination of third party suppliers and Samsara to meet our overall future demand for human cells. We work closely with Samsara and our third-party suppliers to assure adequate supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. If demand for our products and services grows significantly, we may need to identify additional sources of qualified human cells and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity and quality of raw materials needed at a cost effective price. Any failure to obtain a reliable supply of human cells at cost effective prices will harm our business and our results of operations, and could cause us to be unable to comply with the contractual obligations we owe to our customers and collaboration partners. Further, any failure to obtain a reliable supply of human cells may delay or harm our therapeutic tissue development and regulatory approval efforts.\nIf our laboratory facilities become inoperable, we will lose access to our 3D bioprinters and tissues, and our ability to conduct our business and comply with our contractual obligations will be harmed.\nWe manufacture our NovoGen Bioprinters\u00ae and our 3D Human Liver Tissues at our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California. We also provide research services to our customers and collaboration partners and conduct our product research and development activities at our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California. We do not currently have redundant laboratory facilities. Our San Diego, California laboratory facilities are situated near active earthquake fault lines. Our facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by\nnatural or manmade disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, fires, power outages and contamination, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to continue to provide our products and services and engage in our research and development activities for some period of time. Even if our facilities are inoperable for a short period of time, we may suffer the loss of our existing tissue and cell inventory, and the loss of any research services and activities currently in process. Accordingly, any disruption to operations at our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California would materially affect our business, prospects and results of operations.\nWe currently rely on third-party suppliers for some of our materials, including our supply of human cells, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers in the future to produce our tools and products.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and vendors for some of the human cells and other materials we utilize in our products and services and in our research and development activities. We currently acquire our human cells from Samsara and third-party suppliers. Any significant problem experienced by one of our suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until such supplier resolves the problem or an alternative source of supply is located. Any delay, interruption or inability to obtain an adequate supply of human cells would negatively affect our operations. In addition, in the future we may require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our tools and products. If we are unable to manufacture our products in commercial quantities or the third-parties on which we rely to manufacture our tools and products fail to perform as anticipated, our business and future growth will suffer.\nWe may not be successful in establishing Samsara as a profitable commercial business.\nIn January 2016, we announced that our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara, commenced commercial operations. We formed Samsara to serve as a key source of certain of the primary human cells we utilize in our products and services and in the development of therapeutic products. In addition to supplying human cells for our business requirements, we believe there is an opportunity for Samsara to operate as a commercial business by selling human cells to other pharmaceutical, biotech and research organizations. Samsara has begun selling its human cell offerings to end users both directly and through distribution partners. Operating and developing Samsara\u2019s business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nfailing to source a sufficient supply of high quality human organs or cells;\n\u2022\nfailing to achieve market acceptance for its human cell offerings;\n\u2022\nfailing to demonstrate the quality and reliability of its human cell offerings;\n\u2022\nfailing to be both cost effective and competitive with the products offered by third parties;\n\u2022\nfailing to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nfailing to be able to produce its human cell offerings on a large scale;\n\u2022\nfailing to establish and maintain distribution relationships with reliable third parties;\n\u2022\nfailing to hire and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\ninfringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nIf any of these or any other risks and uncertainties occur, our efforts to establish Samsara as a commercial business may be unsuccessful, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales will be dependent upon our customers\u2019 capital spending policies and research and development budgets, and government funding of research and development programs at universities and other organizations, which are each subject to significant and unexpected decrease.\nOur prospective customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories, and private research foundations. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, patent expirations, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions, and institutional and governmental budgetary policies, including but not limited to reductions in grants for research by federal and state agencies as a result of the current budget crises and budget reduction measures. In addition, our business could be seriously damaged by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories, or private foundations.\nThe timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government funding of research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast. Research funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to the previous years and has declined in some countries, and some grants have been frozen for extended periods of time or otherwise become unavailable to various institutions, sometimes without advance notice. Government funding of research and\ndevelopment is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Other programs, such as homeland security or defense, or general efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit could be viewed by the United States government as a higher priority. These budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities. National Institute of Health and other research and development allocations have been diminished in recent years by federal budget control efforts. The prolonged or increased shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products or services, which could seriously damage our business.\nAn inability to manage our growth or expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business operations and activities and employee headcount may grow rapidly, which could place a strain on our management and operational systems. To effectively manage our operations and growth, we may need to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. In addition, our management will need to successfully:\n\u2022\nexpand our research and product development efforts;\n\u2022\nimplement and expand our sales, marketing and customer support programs;\n\u2022\nexpand, train and manage our employee base; and\n\u2022\neffectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise.\nWe may not manage any required growth and expansion successfully, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully attract, hire and integrate key additional employees or if we are unable to retain our executive officers and other key personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate our recently hired key executive officers, such as Taylor Crouch (our Chief Executive Officer) and Craig Kussman (our Chief Financial Officer), as well as the other technical, managerial and sales and marketing personnel required to support our business. Our success will also depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key personnel, especially our executive officers. We do not currently have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers or our other key personnel, and there is no guarantee that our executive officers or key personnel will remain employed with us. Moreover, we have not obtained key man life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death, disability or incapacity of any of our executive officers or other key personnel. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for any executive officers and other key personnel we lose in the future would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. Additionally, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. As a result, the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to timely attract and hire qualified personnel in the future (in particular skilled technical, managerial and sales and marketing personnel) will adversely impact our ability to meet our key commercial and technical goals and successfully implement our business plan.\nWe may be subject to security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents that could compromise our information and expose us to liability.\nWe routinely collect and store sensitive data (such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information) for the Company, its employees and its suppliers and customers. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our computer systems and networks and to protect this information. However, like other companies in our industry, our networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, foreign companies or competitors, or may be breached by employee error, malfeasance or other disruption. Any such breach could result in unauthorized access to (or disclosure of) sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours, our employees or our suppliers or customers, and/or loss or damage to our data. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of information could cause competitive harms, result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and/or cause reputational harm.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.\nWe do business with customers outside the United States. We intend to continue to pursue customers and growth opportunities in international markets, and we expect that international revenues may account for a significant percentage of our revenues in the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks arising from our international business, including those related to:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, potentially reducing the United States dollars we receive for sales denominated in foreign currency;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the markets we operate in;\n\u2022\npotential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\u2022\npotential trade restrictions and exchange controls;\n\u2022\nmore limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries, whether due to cultural differences, exchange rate fluctuation or other factors.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, we are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nViolation of government regulations or quality programs could harm demand for our products or services, and the evolving nature of government regulations could have an adverse impact on our business.\nTo the extent that our collaborators or customers use our products in the manufacturing or testing processes for their drug and medical device products, such end-products or services may be regulated by the FDA under Quality System Regulations (QSR) or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA\u201988) regulations. The customer is ultimately responsible for QSR, CLIA\u201988 and other compliance requirements for their products. However, we may agree to comply with certain requirements, and, if we fail to do so, we could lose sales and our collaborators or customers and be exposed to regulatory delays or objections and potential product liability claims. In addition, our customers may require that our services be conducted pursuant to the requirements of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in order to provide suitable data for their INDs and other regulatory filings. No regulatory review of data from our platform technology has yet been conducted and there is no guarantee that our technology will be acceptable under GLP, or that we will be able to comply with GLP requirements on the timetable required by our customers. As a result, the violation of government regulations or failure to comply with quality requirements could harm demand for our products or services, and the evolving nature of government regulations could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAny therapeutic tissues we develop will be subject to extensive, lengthy and uncertain regulatory requirements, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all.\nAny therapeutic and other life science products we develop, including our therapeutic human liver tissue, will be subject to extensive, lengthy and uncertain regulatory approval process by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable agencies in other countries. The regulation of new products is extensive, and the required process of laboratory testing and clinical studies is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We may not be able to obtain FDA approvals for any therapeutic products we develop in a timely manner, or at all. We may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses. Even if we obtain FDA regulatory approvals, the FDA extensively regulates manufacturing, labeling, distributing, marketing, promotion and advertising after product approval. Moreover, several of our product development areas may involve relatively new technologies and have not been the subject of extensive laboratory testing and clinical studies. The regulatory requirements governing these products and related clinical procedures remain uncertain and the products themselves may be subject to substantial review by the FDA and other foreign governmental regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay approval in the United States and any other foreign country. Regulatory requirements ultimately imposed on our products could limit our ability to test, manufacture and, ultimately, commercialize our products and thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we continue to adapt and develop parts of our product line in the future, including tissue-based products in the field of regenerative medicine, the manufacture and marketing of our products will become subject to government regulation in the United States and other countries. In the United States and most foreign countries, we will be required to complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product. The steps required by the FDA before our proposed products may be marketed in the United States include performance of preclinical (animal and laboratory) tests; submissions to the FDA of an IND, NDA (New Drug Application), or BLA (Biologic License Application) which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product in the intended target population; and performance of a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process intended for commercial use.\nThe processes are expensive and can take many years to complete, and we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products to the satisfaction of such regulatory authorities. The start of clinical trials can be delayed or take longer than anticipated for many and varied reasons, many of which are outside of our control. Safety concerns may emerge that could lengthen the ongoing trials or require additional trials to be conducted. Regulatory authorities may also require additional testing, and we may be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represent an improved form of treatment over existing therapies, which we may be unable to do without conducting further clinical studies. Moreover, if the FDA grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to our distribution. Expanded or additional indications for approved devices or drugs may not be approved, which could limit our revenues. Foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval. Consequently, even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our product candidates, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction. If our products are not approved, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our business will be adversely affected.\nEven if a product gains regulatory approval, such approval is likely to limit the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, and the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including adverse event reporting requirements and the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved uses. Failure to comply with any post-approval requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, product seizures, recalls, substantial fines, injunctions, suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these enforcement actions, any unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements, or any safety issues that arise with any approved products, could adversely affect our ability to market products and generate revenues and thus adversely affect our ability to continue our business.\nWe also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product, even after obtaining product approval, if previously unknown problems with the product or our manufacturer are subsequently discovered and we cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory approval. With the use of any treatment by a wide patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the treatment itself, and only if the specific event occurs with some regularity over a period of time does the treatment become suspect as having a causal relationship to the adverse event. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, possibly subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nIf restrictions on reimbursements and health care reform limit our or our collaborators\u2019 actual or potential financial returns on therapeutic products that we or they develop based on our platform technology, we may not be able to recover our research and development costs and our collaborators may reduce or terminate their collaborations with us.\nOur ability to recover our research and development costs and successfully commercialize any therapeutic products we develop and our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully commercialize the therapeutic and other life science products they develop through the research tools or services that we provide them may depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate payments for these products will be available from government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, and other third-party payers. These payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutic and other life science products, and coverage and adequate payments may not be available for these products.\nIn recent years, officials have made numerous proposals to change the health care system in the U.S. These proposals included measures to limit or eliminate payments for some medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products to government control. Government and other third-party payers increasingly attempt to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of payments of newly approved health care products. In some cases, they may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for disease indications other than those for which the FDA has granted marketing approval. Governments may adopt future legislative proposals and federal, state or private payers for healthcare goods and services may take action to limit their payments for goods and services. Any of these events could reduce the demand for our products and services by our collaboration partners, reduce the proceeds we receive from our arrangements with our collaboration partners based on future sales of their therapeutic products or limit our ability to recover our research and development costs and successfully commercialize any therapeutic products we develop.\nWe use hazardous chemicals, biological materials and infectious agents in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur product manufacturing research and development, and testing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological materials and infectious disease agents. We cannot eliminate the risks of accidental contamination or the accidental spread or discharge of these materials, or any resulting injury from such an event. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, and the experimental use of animals. Our operations may require that environmental permits and approvals be issued by applicable government agencies. We also cannot accurately predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative action. Any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our technologies, intellectual property and products and service offerings in the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use our technologies and gain a competitive advantage.\nTo protect our products and technologies, we and our collaborators and licensors must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and pursue other intellectual property protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. Moreover, the patent positions of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, we cannot guarantee that:\n\u2022\nany patent applications filed by us will issue as patents;\n\u2022\nthird parties will not challenge our proprietary rights, and if challenged that a court or an administrative board of a patent office will hold that our patents are valid and enforceable;\n\u2022\nthird parties will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies by inventing around our claims;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will cover our technology and products as ultimately developed;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business; or\n\u2022\nas issued patents expire, we will not lose some competitive advantage.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions have an absolute requirement of novelty that renders any public disclosure of an invention immediately fatal to patentability in such jurisdictions. Therefore, there is a risk that we may not be able to protect some of our intellectual property in the United States or abroad due to disclosures, which we may not be aware of, by our collaborators or licensors. Some foreign jurisdictions prohibit certain types of patent claims, such as \u201cmethod-of-treatment/use-type\u201d claims; thus, the scope of protection available to us in such jurisdictions is limited.\nMoreover, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our potential products and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not sought or obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. Or, our licensors may breach or otherwise prematurely terminate the provisions of our license agreements with them. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims or lawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our collaborators or licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, our licensors may retain certain rights to use technologies licensed by us for research purposes. Patent disputes can take years to resolve, can be very costly and can result in loss of rights, injunctions and substantial penalties. Moreover, patent disputes and related proceedings can distract management\u2019s attention and interfere with running the business.\nFurthermore, because of the potential for substantial discovery in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments which could harm our business.\nAs more companies file patents relating to bioprinters and bioprinted tissues, it is possible that patent claims relating to bioprinters or bioprinted human tissue may be asserted against us, and any such assertions could harm our business. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities, which have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product shipment or delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are successful in defending such claims, infringement and other intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\nOur current and future research, development and commercialization activities also must satisfy the obligations under our license agreements. Any disputes arising under our license agreements could be costly and distract our management from the conduct of our business. Moreover, premature termination of a license agreement could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) to determine the priority of invention. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party.\nThird parties may also attempt to initiate reexamination, post grant review or inter partes review of our patents or those of our collaborators or licensors in the PTO. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and potential products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for these breaches. Alternatively, if a third party alleges that any of our employees or consultants has breached confidentiality obligations to our benefit, we may have to defend against allegations of trade secret misappropriation.\nEnforcing or defending a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Further, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent that competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely in part on trademarks to distinguish our products and services from those of other entities. Trademarks may be opposed or cancelled and we may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our trademarks.\nWe rely on trademarks, in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, to distinguish our products and services in the minds of consumers and our business partners from those of other entities. Third parties may challenge our pending trademark applications through opposition proceedings in the U.S., or comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, in which they seek to prevent registration of a mark. Our registered trademarks may be subject to cancellation proceedings in the U.S., or comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, in which a third party seeks to cancel an existing registration. To enforce our trademark rights, we may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings which could be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Liquidity Risks\nWe have a limited trading history and there is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future.\nThere is limited trading history in our common stock, and although our common stock is now traded on the NASDAQ Global Market, there is no assurance that an active market in our common stock will continue at present levels or increase in the future. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of our common stock on the timeline and at the volumes they desire. This factor limits the liquidity of our common stock, and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our ability to raise additional capital.\nCompliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.\nWe are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of complying with the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, including preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders, can be substantial.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities and our stock price could decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires an attestation and report by our external auditing firm on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe our system and process evaluation and testing comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be able to satisfy the requirements in Section 404 in all future periods, especially as we grow our business. If we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or NASDAQ. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be required to incur significant additional financial and management resources to achieve compliance.\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments by us or our competitors, including new product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nresults of our preclinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our therapeutic products;\n\u2022\nreduced government funding for research and development activities;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u2022\ndegree of coverage of securities analysts and reports and recommendations issued by securities analysts regarding our business;\n\u2022\nvolume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of March 31, 2018, there were an aggregate of 129,467,796 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. That total for our common stock includes 14,674,466 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or is available for issuance under our equity incentive plans, 1,285,103 shares of common stock that may be issued through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d), and 220,000 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants.\nIn the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities to raise funds to support our continued operations and to implement our business plan. We may also issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, or for other business purposes. If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders may result. In addition, the future issuance of any such additional shares of capital stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. Moreover, depending on market conditions, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.\nOur common stock is subject to trading risks created by the influence of third party investor websites.\nOur common stock is widely traded and held by retail investors, and these investors are subject to the influence of information provided by third party investor websites and independent authors distributing information on the internet. This information has become influential because it is widely distributed and links to it appear as top company headlines on commonly used stock quote and finance websites, or through services such as Google alerts. These emerging information distribution models are a consequence of the emergence of the internet. Some information and content distribution is by individuals through platforms that mainly serve as hosts seeking advertising revenue. As such, we believe an incentive exists for these sites to increase advertising revenue by increasing page views, and for them to post or allow to be posted inflammatory information to achieve this end. It has been our experience that a significant portion of the information on these websites or distributed by independent authors about our Company is false or misleading, and occasionally, we believe, purposefully misleading. These sites and internet distribution strategies also create opportunity for individuals to pursue both \u201cpump and dump\u201d and \u201cshort and distort\u201d strategies. We believe that many of these websites have little or no requirements for authors to have professional qualifications. While these sites sometimes require disclosure of stock positions by authors, as far as we are aware these sites do not audit the accuracy of such conflict of interest disclosures. We believe that many of these websites have few or lax editorial standards, and thin or non-existent editorial staffs. Despite our best efforts, we have not and may not be able in the future to obtain corrections to information provided on these websites about our Company, including both positive and negative information, and any corrections that are obtained may not be achieved prior to the majority of audience impressions being formed for a given article. These conditions create volatility and risk for holders of our common stock and should be considered by investors. We can make no guarantees that regulatory authorities will take action on these types of activities, and we cannot guarantee that legislators will act responsively, or ever act at all, to appropriately restrict the activities of these websites and authors.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no dividends on our common stock to date and it is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of our business, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan. As an investor, you should take note of the fact that a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our stock, and could significantly affect the value of any investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified Board of Directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 14033, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ONVO"}
