{"cik": "864509", "company": "COMMAND SECURITY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-06-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operating results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation and General Liability Claims\nOngoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings. We can provide no assurance that costs associated with workers\u2019 compensation claims will not increase in the future. In addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to mitigate future increases in workers\u2019 compensation costs or limit the frequency or severity of our workers\u2019 compensation claims, which could cause further increases in our workers\u2019 compensation costs. Future increases in workers\u2019 compensation costs, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLoss of Customers\nOur success depends in part upon retaining our large security and aviation services customers. See \u201cBusiness-Significant Customers.\u201d In general, security services companies such as ours face the risk of losing customers as a result of the expiration or termination of a contract, or as a result of a merger or acquisition or business failure involving our large customers, or the selection by such customers of another provider of security services. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from large security services and airline customers, some of which have in the past and may in the future experience substantial financial difficulties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain all or a substantial portion of our long-term or significant customers or develop relationships with new significant customers in the future.\nOur standard customer contract may be terminated by either the Company or our customer on 30 to 90 days written notice at any time. In addition, we serve certain customers under month-to-month extensions of these written contracts. If we are not able to maintain our existing security service contracts or obtain additional security service contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nSignificant Customers\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company had six customers, who represented approximately 60% of the Company\u2019s total revenues. These six customers included one domestic and one international airline, the USPS, a large transportation company, an online retailer and web services provider and a northeast U.S. based healthcare facility. Two of these six customers represented 24% and 14% of total revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The contract with the large transportation company was terminated effective August 31, 2017. In addition, the scope of work with the large online retailer, representing 18% of total revenues, was terminated effective May 31, 2018. Total revenues from the remaining five largest customers represent approximately 37% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. While the Company\u2019s cost structure is highly variable and largely identifiable to the delivery of services for any specific contract, any loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAcquisitions\nPart of our growth strategy involves seeking to acquire other successful security services companies. Our acquisition strategy entails numerous risks. The pursuit of acquisition candidates is expensive and may not be successful. Our ability to complete future acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and, if necessary, finance those acquisitions, in each case, before any attractive candidates are purchased by other parties, some of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Whether or not any particular acquisition is successfully completed, each of these activities is expensive and time consuming and would likely require our management to spend considerable time and effort to complete, which would detract from our management\u2019s ability to run our current business. Although we may spend considerable funds and efforts to pursue acquisitions, we may not be able to complete them.\nAcquisitions could result in the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n\u25cf dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u25cf incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf increased amortization expenses related to intangible assets;\n\u25cf difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other business activities.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to complete acquisitions that we believe are necessary to complement our growth strategy on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, if we do not successfully integrate the operations of any companies that we have acquired or subsequently acquire, we may not achieve the potential benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe are Subject to Risks Associated with our Foreign Operations.\nWe perform security services in Honduras and may expand our business into other foreign countries in the future. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in the global market. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in economic and political conditions, fluctuation in exchange rates, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental laws and regulations, natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, and other external factors over which we have no control.\nAdditional Financing\nWe believe that our existing funds, cash generated from operations, and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case, and we may be required to obtain additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities, an increase in borrowings under our credit facilities or otherwise. The failure by us to obtain such financing, if needed, would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit and Security Agreement\nOur Credit and Security Agreement contains covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking certain corporate actions. These restrictions may limit our ability to:\n\u25cf guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf pay dividends and make distributions;\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf repurchase stock;\n\u25cf incur liens;\n\u25cf transfer or sell assets;\n\u25cf enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf merge or consolidate; and\n\u25cf engage in a materially different line of business.\nThe limits set forth in these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs.\nCompetition\nOur assumptions regarding future operating results depend largely upon our ability to retain substantially all of our current customers and obtain new customers. Retention is affected by several factors including, but not limited to, regulatory limitations, the quality of the services that we provide, the quality and pricing of comparable services offered by competitors and continuity of our management and non-management personnel. The contract security officer industry is intensely competitive. There are several major national competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and that, therefore, have the ability to provide more attractive service, cost and compensation incentives to customers and employees than we are able to provide. We also compete with smaller local and regional companies whose familiarity with local markets gives them a competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we will continue to retain customer accounts at historic levels in an increasingly competitive market. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire new customer accounts and retain existing customer accounts on terms as favorable as those previously available, and if we are unable to do so our profitability will be adversely affected.\nCost Management\nOur largest expenses are for payroll and related taxes and employee benefits. Most of our service contracts provide for fixed hourly billing rates, and some of our service contracts provide for payments of either fixed fees or fees that increase by only small amounts during the terms of such service contracts. Competitive pressures in the security and aviation services industries may prevent us from increasing our hourly billing rates on contract anniversary or renewal dates. Our profitability will be adversely affected if, due to inflation, collective bargaining or other causes, including increases beyond our control in minimum or other regulated wage rates or statutory payroll taxes, we are compelled to increase the wages, salaries and related benefits of our employees in amounts that exceed the amount that we can pass on to our customers through increased billing rates charged under our service contracts.\nOur ability to realize financial expectations will be largely dependent upon management\u2019s ability to maintain or increase gross margins, which in turn will be determined in large part by management\u2019s ability to control our expenses. However, to a significant extent, certain costs are not within the control of management, and margins may be adversely affected by a number of items, including litigation expenses, fees incurred in connection with extraordinary business transactions, inflation, labor unrest, increased payroll and related costs. Our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if the costs associated with these items are greater than we anticipate.\nThe Litigation Environment in Which we Operate Poses a Significant Risk to our Business.\nWe are involved in a number of lawsuits related to employment issues. Judges and juries have recently demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts to plaintiffs in connection with employment related cases. We use appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us. Litigation is always subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable. Even when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Cost and Exposure of Being a Public Company is Proportionately High for Small Companies like us and May Put us at a Competitive Disadvantage.\nThe rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission increase the scope, complexity, and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. The necessary compliance costs, including costs related to internal controls and management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls, are proportionately higher for a company of our size. Additionally, the disclosures we make can represent a significant proportion of our business and such disclosure can put us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who do not make comparable disclosures.\nIndemnification Obligations\nIn many cases, our security and aviation services contracts require us to indemnify our customers or may otherwise subject us to additional liability for events occurring on customer premises. While we maintain insurance programs that we believe provide appropriate coverage for certain liability risks, including personal injury, death and property damage, the laws of many states limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive damages arising from willful or grossly negligent conduct. Therefore, insurance may not be adequate to cover all potential claims or damages. If a plaintiff brings a successful claim against us for punitive damages in excess of our insurance coverage, we could incur substantial liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStaffing\nOur business involves the labor-intensive delivery of security and aviation services. We derive our revenues primarily from services rendered by our hourly employees. Our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain our skilled operational and administrative staff. The loss of the services of, or the failure to recruit, the required complement of operational and administrative staff would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to secure and complete security service contracts. Additionally, if we do not successfully manage our existing operational and administrative staff, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated gross margins, service quality, overtime levels and other performance measures that are important to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProfessional Reputation\nWe depend to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for quality contract security services. Our customers\u2019 expectations and perception of the quality of our services are in large part determined by the satisfaction they derive from contact with our managers. A well-publicized security incident or breach at one or more of our customers\u2019 locations could result in a negative perception of our services, damage to our reputation and the loss of existing or potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in Accounting Standards and Taxation Requirements\nNew accounting standards or pronouncements that become applicable to us and our financial statements from time to time, and changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. We are also subject to income and various other taxes in the numerous jurisdictions where we generate revenues. Increases in income or other tax rates or bases could reduce our after-tax results from affected jurisdictions in which we operate.\nCollective Bargaining Agreements with Employees\nApproximately 40% of our workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements. If we are unable to renew such agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe security industry has been the subject of campaigns to increase the number of unionized employees. In addition, strikes or work stoppages at our locations could impair our ability to provide required services to our customers, which would reduce our revenues and expose us to customer claims. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure you that organized labor action at one or more of our operating locations will not occur, or that any such activities, or any other labor difficulties at our operating locations, would not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCollection of Accounts Receivable\nWe extend credit to our customers primarily through the use of weekly or monthly billings generally due within 30 to 60 days of the invoice date. Any default in the payment of accounts receivable by one or more of our significant customers due to bankruptcy or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cNotes to Financial Statements-Note 11 Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers.\u201d\nLoss of Key Management Personnel\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior management personnel. We have programs in place that have been designed to motivate, reward and retain such employees, including cash bonus and equity incentive plans. The loss or unavailability of any such key executives or senior management personnel, due to retirement, resignation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified replacement personnel on a timely basis, or at all.\nConcentration of Stock Ownership\nAlthough none of our directors and officers has any agreement relating to the manner in which they will vote their shares of our common stock, such parties together own shares representing approximately 25% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. Further, as of March 31, 2018, based on public filings, there are two other shareholders that combined own approximately 34% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. The concentration of ownership among these shareholders could give them the power to influence the outcome of substantially all matters subject to a vote of our shareholders, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Such decisions may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. This beneficial ownership and potential effective control on all matters relating to our business and operations could eliminate the possibility of other shareholders obtaining the necessary shareholder vote to affect any change in the course of our business if they disagree with these significant shareholders.\nStock Price Volatility\nThe stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate as a result of variations in our operating results. Due to the nature of our business, the market price of our common stock may fall in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: announcements of competitive developments by others; changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts; any loss by us of a major customer; additions or departures of key management or other personnel; future sales of our common or preferred stock; acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors; our historical and anticipated operating results; quarterly fluctuations in our financial and operating results; volume fluctuations; changes in market valuations of other companies that operate in our business markets or industry sector; and general market and economic conditions. Accordingly, market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions and interest rate changes, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock trades on the NYSE American and has low trading volumes compared to other companies traded on the NYSE American. Securities with low trading volumes are subject to greater volatility in price. We cannot predict how our common stock will trade in the future or the effect that trading volumes will have on our common stock price.\nInformation Systems/Technology\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations across the country and between our personnel and our customers and suppliers. Security breaches of this infrastructure can create disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent such breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.\nChanges in technologies that provide alternatives to security officer services or that decrease the number of security officers required to effectively perform their services may decrease our customers\u2019 demand for our security officer services. In addition, if such technologies become available generally for use in the industry, these technologies may be proprietary in nature and not be available for use by us in servicing our customers. Even if these technologies are available for use by us, we may not be able to successfully integrate such technologies into our business or we may be less successful in doing so than our competitors or new entrants in the industry. A decrease in the demand for our security officer services or our inability to effectively utilize such technologies may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation\nWe are subject to a large number of city, county and state occupational licensing laws and regulations that apply to security officers. Any liability we may have from our failure to comply with these regulations may materially and adversely affect our business by restricting our operations and subjecting us to potential penalties. If the current regulation and federalization of pre-board screening and documentation verification services provided by us to airline customers is expanded into other areas such as general security and baggage handling at aviation facilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, comprehensive U.S. occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations may become more stringent and result in necessary modifications to our current practices and facilities. Any or all of these laws and regulations could force us to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations at certain domestic airport locations are subject to audits by the relevant state or local government authorities, in connection with their evaluation of whether certain of our sales and services at such airports are subject to a regulatory fee. In the event of a dispute with any such regulatory authority, we could be subject to claims for fees, including penalties and interest, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the U.S. This legislation expanded the availability of health care coverage for many uninsured individuals and in some cases expanded coverage for those already insured. In light of the change in presidential administrations, in areas where the Secretary of Health and Human Services has discretion to modify legislation, we expect a different coverage and enforcement regimen, to the extent permitted by law. These differences in enforcement and coverage are unclear at this time, as are the financial implications of whatever changes may be implemented. New legislation or changes in existing legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs. The costs of these provisions are expected to be funded by a variety of taxes, fees and penalties. Some of the taxes and fees, as well as certain health care changes required by these acts, have resulted, directly or indirectly, in increased health care costs for us. We cannot quantify the extent of any long-term impact from the legislation or any potential changes to the legislation. There is no assurance that we will be able to absorb and/or pass through the costs of complying with such legislation in a manner that will not adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur current and future operations may be subject to additional regulation as a result of, among other factors, new statutes and regulations and changes in the manner in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted.\nEconomic Downturn\nDuring economic declines, some decisions to implement security programs and install systems may be deferred or cancelled. In other cases, customers may increase their purchases of security systems because they fear more inventory shrinkage and theft will occur due to increasing economic need. We are not able to accurately predict to what extent an economic slowdown will affect the demand for our services. If demand for our services decreases, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nCatastrophic Events\nWe are exposed to potential claims resulting from the occurrence of catastrophic events, such as acts of terrorism, or based upon allegations that we failed to perform our services in accordance with contractual or industry standards. Our insurance coverage limits are currently $1.0 million per occurrence for non-aviation related business (with additional first and second layer excess liability policies of $5.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively) and $30.0 million per occurrence for aviation related business. We retain the risk for the first $25,000 of general liability non-aviation related operations. The Aviation related deductible is $5,000 per occurrence, with the exception of $50,000 for airport wheelchair and electric cart operations, $25,000 for damage to aircraft and $100,000 for skycap operations. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a program within the United States Department of the Treasury, under which the federal government and the insurance industry, share the risk of loss from future \u201cacts of terrorism,\u201d as defined in such Act. We currently maintain additional insurance coverage for losses arising from \u201cacts of terrorism\u201d under our non-aviation related business policy. In addition, terrorist attacks could have a material adverse impact on us by increasing our insurance premium costs, making adequate insurance coverage unavailable or by requiring us to incur additional personnel costs as a result of compliance with expanded security rules and regulations.\nStrategic Initiatives\nAny strategic initiatives that we may undertake may not achieve the benefits anticipated and could result in additional unanticipated costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. We regularly evaluate our existing operations, service capacity and business efficiencies and, as a result of such evaluations, we may undertake strategic initiatives within our businesses. These strategic initiatives may not result in improvements in future financial performance. If we are unable to realize the benefits of any strategic initiatives or appropriately structure our businesses to meet market conditions, the strategic initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 76330, "SIC": 7381, "TIC": "MOC"}
