As such, prospective investors and shareholders should carefully consider and evaluate all of the risk factors described below as well as other factors discussed in this Form 10-K Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that are not currently believed by us to be material may also harm our business operations and financial results. These risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended, supplemented, or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K that we file with the SEC in the future.\nCompany Risk Factors\nOur business, operating results and financial condition has and may in the future be adversely impacted by COVID-19.\nThe novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has created significant economic disruption and uncertainty around the world. COVID-19 adversely impacted our operating results during 2020 with an estimated negative impact to net income of approximately $2,000 or $0.12 per diluted share, primarily as a result of overall disruptions in supply chains impacting both commercial and government/defense markets, revenue declines in oil and gas and international industrial markets, and an approximately one-month closure of our China facility during the first quarter of 2020 as mandated by the Chinese government. This negative impact was partially offset by increased demand for our medical batteries, especially those used in ventilators, respirators and infusion pumps. While the Chinese government has lifted the suspension of business operations in China and we have maintained normal business operations at all our other facilities throughout the pandemic, the extent to which COVID-19 may further impact our business is uncertain and will depend on many evolving factors which we continue to monitor but cannot predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic. Potential effects of COVID-19 that may adversely impact our future business include limited availability and/or increased cost of raw materials and components used in our products, reduced demand and/or pricing for our products, inability of our customers to pay for our products or remain solvent, and reduced availability of our workforce. Prolonged adverse effects of COVID-19 on our business could result in the impairment of long-lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets. Further, we cannot predict all possible adverse effects the COVID-19 pandemic may cause as a result of which there may be adverse effects in addition to those described in this Risk Factor. While we continue to closely monitor the developments surrounding COVID-19 and take actions when possible to mitigate the business risks involved, the potential effects of COVID-19 on our business, alone or taken together, may pose a material risk to our future operating results and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from certain key customers.\nWe have two customers, L3Harris Technologies and Thales Defense & Security, Inc., both large defense primary contractors, which comprised 17% and 6% of our total revenues in 2020, respectively, and 12% and 14% of our total revenues in 2019, respectively. There were no other customers that comprised greater than 10% of our total revenues during these years. While we consider our relationship with our major customers to be good, the reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or their insolvency / inability to pay, for any reason, would reduce our revenue and operating income and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition in other ways.\nOur operations in China are subject to unique risks and uncertainties, including political shifts, tariffs and trade restrictions.\nOur operating facility in China presents risks including, but not limited to, changes in local regulatory requirements, changes in labor laws, local wage laws, environmental regulations, taxes and operating licenses, compliance with U.S. regulatory requirements, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, uncertainties as to application and interpretation of local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights, currency restrictions, currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency, and currency revaluations, eminent domain claims, civil unrest, power outages, water shortages, labor shortages, labor disputes, increase in labor costs, rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, or the threat of boycotts, other civil disturbances, the continued impact of the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. Government on 9-volt batteries that we manufacture in China as well as any retaliating trade policies or restrictions, and an outbreak of a contagious disease which may cause us or our suppliers and/or customers to temporarily suspend operations in the affected city. Any such disruptions could depress our earnings and have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, fluctuations in the price of oil and gas and the resulting volatility in the level of downhole drilling could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pricing fluctuations typically encountered in the oil and gas industry, especially over the past few years, have placed financial strain not only on the producers, but also the companies that provide oilfield services and equipment to them. The cyclicality in this industry, whether driven by geopolitical developments; international tensions; supply and demand economics; the introduction of new global, national, and industry-specific regulations; U.S. administration policies; and technology, is an ongoing reality. A significant downturn in the price of oil resulting in a decrease in downhole drilling will very likely have an adverse impact on our financial results. In response, we would expect to mitigate a portion, but not all, of this risk by seeking product/market diversification throughout our portfolio.\nBreaches in security, whether cyber or physical, and related disruptions and/or our inability to prevent or respond to such breaches, could diminish our ability to generate revenues or contain costs, compromise our assets, and negatively impact our business in other ways.\nWe face certain security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, and threats to physical and cyber security. Our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. The risks of a security breach, cyber- attack, cyber intrusion, or disruption, particularly through actions taken by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, have increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have acquired and developed systems and processes designed to protect our proprietary or classified information, they may not be sufficient and the failure to prevent these types of events could disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, and weaken our results of operations and liquidity. In 2017, we formed a cyber security executive management committee with oversight responsibility to minimize the risk of breaches. In 2018, this committee with the assistance of outside security consultants completed a comprehensive Systems Security Plan (\u201cSSP\u201d) and a Plan of Action & Milestones (\u201cPOAM\u201d) in compliance with the requirements of National Institute of Standards and Technology (\u201cNIST\u201d) Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations. In 2019, the Company made further progress in implementing many of the security measures in our SSP and POAM, including increasing the security awareness across our employee base. In 2020, we continued to make substantial progress towards achieving full implementation of all NIST 800-171 security standards, as well as the requirements under the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) framework released by the Department of Defense in 2020. The Committee continues to review all key aspects of cyber security utilizing our outside security consultants to ensure a robust plan is in place and provides quarterly updates to our Board. Despite these measures, we cannot eliminate the risk of such security breaches and the potential adverse impacts these breaches may have on our business and financial results.\nOur efforts to develop new products or new commercial applications for our products could be prolonged or could fail.\nAlthough we develop certain products for new commercial applications, we cannot assure that these new products will be accepted due to the highly competitive nature of the industry. There are many new product and technology entrants into the markets into which we sell our products, and we must continually reassess the markets in which our products can be successful and seek to engage customers in those markets that will adopt our products for use in their products. In addition, these customers must be successful with their products in their markets for us to gain increased business. Increased competition, failure to gain customer acceptance of products, the introduction of competitive technologies or failure of our customers in their markets could have a further adverse effect on our business and reduce our revenue and operating income.\nReductions or delays in U.S. and foreign military spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with U.S. and foreign militaries or OEMs that supply U.S. and foreign militaries. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 approximately $45,382 or 42% and $47,100 or 44%, respectively, of our revenues were comprised of sales made directly or indirectly to U.S. and foreign militaries.\nWhile significant gains have been made in commercial markets with our Battery & Energy Products business, we are still highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government customers. The amounts and percentages of our net revenue that were derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the Department of Defense, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately $38,900 or 36% in 2020 and $41,300 or 39% in 2019. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government or any prime defense contractor could significantly reduce our revenue. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other contractors or suppliers.\nBudget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government, including possible future sequestration periods or other similar formulaic reductions in federal expenditures, are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our business. A decline in U.S. military expenditures could result in a reduction in the military\u2019s demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in demand for products using our batteries or communications systems could reduce demand for our products and/or our products could become obsolete resulting in lower revenues and profitability.\nA substantial portion of our business depends on the continued demand for products using our batteries and communications systems sold by our customers, including original equipment manufacturers. Our success depends significantly upon the success of those customers\u2019 products in the marketplace. We are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success or failure of a particular product or service offered by a customer, including:\n\u25cf\ncompetition faced by the customer in its particular industry,\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of the customer\u2019s product or service,\n\u25cf\nthe engineering, sales, marketing and management capabilities of the customer,\n\u25cf\ntechnical challenges unrelated to our technology or products faced by the customer in developing its products or services, and\n\u25cf\nthe financial and other resources of the customer.\nThe market for our products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards, often resulting in product obsolescence or short product lifecycles. Although we believe that our products utilize state-of-the-art technology, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop technologies or products that would render our technologies and products obsolete or less marketable. Many of the companies with which we compete have substantially greater resources than we do, and some have the capacity and volume of business to be able to produce their products more efficiently than we can. In addition, these companies are developing or have developed products using a variety of technologies that are expected to compete with our technologies. Furthermore, we have noted an increase in foreign competition, especially in Asia, over the last several years which tend to compete on price in the battery industry. If these companies successfully market their products in a manner that renders our technologies obsolete, this would reduce our revenue and operating income and could have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, our supply of raw materials and components could be disrupted or delayed due to business conditions, weather, or other factors out of our control, or the cost of those raw materials and components may materially increase.\nCertain materials and components used in our products are available only from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As such, some materials and components could become in short supply resulting in limited availability and/or increased costs. Additionally, we may elect to develop relationships with a single or limited number of suppliers for materials and components that are otherwise generally available. Due to our supplying defense products to the U.S. government, we could receive a government preference to continue to obtain critical supplies to meet military production needs. However, if the government did not provide us with a government preference in such circumstances, the difficulty in obtaining supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that alternative suppliers are available to supply materials and components that could replace materials and components currently used and that, if necessary, we would be able to redesign our products to make use of such alternatives. However, any interruption in the supply from any supplier that serves as a sole source could delay product shipments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced interruptions of product deliveries by sole source suppliers in the past, and we cannot guarantee that we will not experience a material interruption of deliveries from sole source suppliers in the future. Of particular note is the increased demand for Lithium-based cells from the electric vehicle manufacturers. While this has resulted in increased supply of such cells, we continue to monitor our supply chain closely to ensure that any potential supply interruptions are minimized.\nWith the pre-COVID-19 improvement of the U.S. economy and the potential for a significant post-COVID-19 rebound, our lead times for certain critical components from our suppliers could be extended resulting in shipping delays causing us to miss contractual timelines. Our internal purchasing process is focused on the current economic environment, and lead times are considered when placing orders from our vendors, but we cannot control the ability of our vendors or potential vendors to be qualified to meet our deadlines.\nAdditionally, we could face increasing pricing pressure from our suppliers dependent upon volume due to rising costs by these suppliers that could be passed on to us in higher prices for our raw materials, which could increase our cost of business, lower our margins and have other materially adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth and expansion strategy could strain or overwhelm our resources.\nRapid growth of our business could significantly strain management, operations and technical resources. If we are successful in obtaining rapid market growth of our products, we will likely be required to deliver large volumes of quality products to customers on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. For example, demand for our new or existing products combined with our ability to penetrate new markets and geographies or secure a major project award, could strain the current capacity of our manufacturing facilities and require additional capital resources, equipment and time to meet the required demand. We cannot assure, however, that our business will grow rapidly or that our efforts to expand manufacturing and quality control activities will be successful or that we will be able to satisfy commercial scale production requirements on a timely and cost-effective basis. During 2020, the Company experienced a 94% year-over-year increase in shipments of our medical batteries primarily in response to the higher demand for ventilators, respirators and infusion pumps caused by COVID-19. While we met all of our 2020 commitments to our medical customers, this does not mean that rapid growth for our products in all cases will be met by our resources without delay.\nWe also may be required to continue to improve our operations, management and financial systems and controls in order to remain competitive. The failure to manage growth and expansion effectively could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We address these risks in the annual update of our three-year Strategic Plan which is presented to our Board of Directors.\nThe loss of top management and key personnel could significantly harm our business, and our ability to put in place a succession plan and recruit experienced, competent management is critical to the success of the business.\nThe continuity of our officers and executive team is vital to the successful implementation of our business model and growth strategy designed to deliver sustainable, consistent profitability. A top management priority has been the development and implementation of a formal written succession plan to mitigate the risks associated with the loss of senior executives. This formal succession plan is updated annually and presented to our Board of Directors. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to effectively implement our succession plan.\nBecause of the specialized, technical nature of our business, we are highly dependent on certain members of our management, sales, engineering and technical staffs. The loss of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy will depend upon, among other factors, the successful retention of our key personnel, recruitment of additional highly skilled and experienced managerial, sales, engineering and technical personnel, and the integration of such personnel obtained through business acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain or recruit this type of personnel. An inability to hire sufficient numbers of people or to find people with the desired skills could result in greater demands being placed on limited management resources which could delay or impede the execution of our business plans and have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs or liabilities to satisfy obligations under the terms of the warranties we supply and the contractual terms under which we sell our products and services.\nWith respect to our battery products, we typically offer warranties against any defects in manufacture or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. With respect to our communications systems products, we now offer up to a three-year warranty. We provide a reserve for these potential warranty expenses, which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues. There is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history, and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, there is no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient. Excessive warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain safety risks, including the risk of fire, inherent in the manufacture, use and transportation of Lithium batteries.\nDue to the high energy inherent in Lithium batteries, our Lithium batteries can pose certain safety risks, including the risk of fire. We incorporate procedures in research, development, product design, manufacturing processes and the transportation of Lithium batteries that are intended to minimize safety risks, but we cannot assure that accidents will not occur or that our products will not be subject to recall for safety concerns. Although we currently carry insurance policies which cover loss of plant and machinery, leasehold improvements, inventory and business interruption, any accident, whether at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of the products, may result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries or death. While we maintain what we believe to be sufficient casualty liability coverage to protect against such occurrences, these types of losses could reduce our available cash and our operating and net income and have other material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur entrance into new markets could lead to additional exposure to financial risk or increased liability, and our failure to enter into those markets could lead to negative customer perception or loss of business from existing customers.\nOur new products supporting our commercial diversification strategy will likely result in the introduction of our products in new end markets that we have not participate in before. These new market opportunities may carry certain risks that we may not have experienced in the past or that we may be fully aware. While we perform extensive due diligence in the launch of our products in new end markets and mitigate our risks with our contracts and insurance coverage, we may not be fully aware of the risks that may exist until we gain more experience in these markets.\nOur quarterly and annual results and the price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly.\nOur future operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year depending on factors such as the timing and shipment of significant orders, new product introductions, the transition of new products to higher-volume production, major project wins, U.S. and foreign government demand, delays in customer releases of purchase orders, delays in receiving raw materials from vendors, the mix of distribution channels through which we sell our products and services and general economic conditions. Frequently, a substantial portion of our revenue in each quarter is generated from orders booked and fulfilled during that quarter. As a result, revenue levels are difficult to predict for each quarter. If revenue results are below expectations, operating results will be adversely affected as we have a sizeable base of fixed overhead costs that do not fluctuate much with changes in revenue. Due to such variances in operating results, we have sometimes failed to meet, and in the future may not meet, market expectations regarding our future operating results.\nIn addition to the uncertainties of quarterly and annual operating results, future announcements concerning us or our competitors, including technological innovations or commercial products, litigation or public concerns as to the safety or commercial value of one or more of our products may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, all of which may be unrelated to our operating results.\nAny inability to comply with changes to the regulations for the shipment of our products could limit our ability to transport our products to customers in a cost-effective manner and reduce our operating income and margins.\nThe transportation of Lithium batteries is regulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (\u201cICAO\u201d) and corresponding International Air Transport Association (\u201cIATA\u201d) Dangerous Goods Regulations and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (\u201cIMDG\u201d) and in the U.S. by the Department of Transportation\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d). These regulations are based on the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. We currently ship our products pursuant to ICAO, IATA and PHMSA hazardous goods regulations. These regulations require companies to meet certain testing, packaging, labeling and shipping specifications for safety reasons. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any significant costs in order to comply with these regulations. We believe we comply with all current U.S. and international regulations for the shipment of our products, and we intend and expect to comply with any new regulations that are imposed. We have established our own testing facilities to ensure that we comply with these regulations. If, however, we are unable to comply with any such new regulations, or if regulations are introduced that limit our ability to transport our products to customers in a cost-effective manner, this could reduce our operating income and margins, and have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may not meet the volume expectations in our supply agreements.\nWe sell most of our products and services through supply agreements and contracts. While supply agreements and contracts contain volume-based pricing based on expected volumes, we cannot assure that adjustments to reflect volume shortfalls will be made under current industry practices because pricing is rarely adjusted retroactively when contract volumes are not achieved. Every effort is made to adjust future prices accordingly, but our ability to adjust prices is generally based on market conditions and we may not be able to adjust prices in various circumstances. This could have an adverse impact in the form of lost revenue or increased expenses.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited, which could increase our tax liabilities and reduce our cash flow and net income.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had approximately $47,755 of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and $2,070 of U.S. tax credit carryforward available to offset future taxable income. We continually assess the carrying value of these assets based on the relevant accounting standards. Based on our latest assessment at December 31, 2020, we believe it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will be fully realized. However, failure to achieve our business targets could result in future charges to our income tax provision if any of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards are not utilized. See discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis beginning on Page 27.\nNegative publicity of Lithium-ion batteries may negatively impact the industries or markets we operate in.\nWe are unable to predict the impact, severity or duration of negative publicity related to fire/mishandling of Lithium-ion batteries or the environmental impact of their disposal, and how it may impact the industries or markets we serve. Ongoing negative attention being given to Lithium-ion batteries that are used in certain cellular phones or are integrated into the power systems of new commercial aircraft and electric motor vehicles may have an impact on the Lithium-ion battery industry as a whole, regardless of the design or usage of those batteries. The residual effects of such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe maintain manufacturing operations in North America, Europe and China, and we export products to various countries. We purchase materials and sell our products in foreign currencies, and therefore currency fluctuations may impact our pricing of products sold and materials purchased. Sales to non-U.S. customers make up a significant percentage of our total revenues. For example, the percentage of our business with customers outside of the U.S. slightly increased in 2020 to 42% compared to 41% in 2019. A future strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to our customers\u2019 currencies could make our products relatively more expensive to them and, may adversely affect our sales levels and reduce profitability. In addition, our United Kingdom and China subsidiaries maintain their books in local currency and the translation of the subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results due to changes in local currency value relative to the U.S. dollar. With the rapid pace of geopolitical events, it is difficult at this time to assess any future impact of currency fluctuation on the Company\u2019s financial results, despite our proactive efforts to minimize the short-term risks of currency fluctuations. Accordingly, currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our expenses and reducing our income. Finally, we maintain certain domestic U.S. cash balances denominated in foreign currencies, and the U.S. dollar equivalent of these balances fluctuates with changes in the foreign exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nAny impairment of goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to an impairment test on an annual basis. Additionally, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Any excess carrying value of goodwill and/or other intangible assets resulting from an impairment assessment must be written off in the period of determination. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire a business which will require us to record goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the allocation of the total consideration transferred to consummate the acquisition to the identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values. We may subsequently experience unforeseen circumstances related to past or future acquisitions which may adversely impact the forecasted cash flows or other assumptions used to value these assets. Future determinations that the estimated fair value of our goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their respective carrying values may result in significant (non-cash) impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations.\nA finding that our proprietary and intellectual property rights are not enforceable or invalid could allow our competitors and others to produce competing products based on our proprietary and intellectual property or limit our ability to continue to manufacture and market our products.\nWe believe our success depends more on the knowledge, ability, experience and technological expertise of our employees than on the legal protection of patents and other proprietary rights. However, we claim proprietary rights in various unpatented technologies, know-how, trade secrets and trademarks relating to our products and manufacturing processes. We cannot guarantee the degree of protection these various claims may or will afford, or that competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. We protect our proprietary rights in our products and operations through contractual obligations, including nondisclosure agreements with certain employees, customers, consultants and strategic partners. There can be no assurance as to the degree of protection these contractual measures may or will afford. We have had patents issued and have patent applications pending in the U.S. and elsewhere. We cannot assure (1) that patents will be issued from any of these pending applications, or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology, (2) that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or (3) as to the degree or adequacy of protection any patents or patent applications may or will afford. Further, if we are found to be infringing upon third party patents, we cannot assure that we will not be subjected to significant damages or will be able to obtain licenses with respect to such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain necessary licenses could delay product shipments or the introduction of new products, and costly attempts to design around such patents could foreclose the development, manufacture or sale of products, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and the results of operations.\nWe are subject to the contract rules and procedures of the U.S. and foreign governments. These rules and procedures create significant risks and uncertainties for us that are not usually present in contracts with private parties.\nWe continue to develop battery products and communications systems to meet the needs of the U.S. and foreign governments. We compete in solicitations for awards of contracts. The receipt of an award, however, does not always result in the immediate release of an order and does not guarantee in any way any given volume of orders. Any delay of solicitations or anticipated purchase orders by, or future failure of, the U.S. or foreign governments to purchase products manufactured by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In these scenarios we are also typically required to successfully meet contractual specifications and to pass various qualification-testing for the products under contract. Our inability to pass these tests in a timely fashion, as well as meet delivery schedules for orders released under contract, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, when a U.S. government contract is awarded, there is a government procedure that permits unsuccessful companies to formally protest such award if they believe they were unjustly treated in the evaluation process. As a result of these protests, the government is precluded from proceeding under these contracts until the protests are resolved. A prolonged delay in the resolution of a protest, or a reversal of an award resulting from such a protest could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws.\nThe FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments (to foreign officials and otherwise) and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our training program and policies mandate compliance with such laws. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. If we are found to be liable for violations of anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our third-party partners or agents), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm.\nWe may incur significant costs because of known and unknown environmental matters.\nNational, state and local laws impose various environmental controls on the manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of batteries and of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of batteries. We use and generate a variety of chemicals and other hazardous by-products in our manufacturing operations. These environmental laws govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage and release of wastes and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations can be complex and are subject to change. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations and that, except as noted below, there are no environmental conditions that will require material expenditures for clean up at our present or former facilities or at facilities to which we have sent waste for disposal, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. There can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of materials used to manufacture our batteries or restricting disposal of batteries will not be imposed, or as to how these regulations will affect us or our customers. Such changes in regulations could reduce our operating income and margins and have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of environmental laws, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and third-party property damage or personal injury claims. Failure to comply with environmental requirements could also result in enforcement actions that materially limit or otherwise affect the operations of the facilities involved. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of an environmentally contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property. This liability could result whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials.\nThe EU RoHS Directive places restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. All applicable products sold in the European Union market after July 1, 2006 must comply with EU RoHS Directive. While this directive does not apply to batteries and does not currently affect our defense products, should any changes occur in the directive that would affect our products, we intend and expect to comply with any new regulations that are imposed. Our commercial chargers are in compliance with this directive. Additional European Union directives, entitled the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) Directive and the Directive \"on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators\", impose regulations affecting our non-defense products. These directives require that producers or importers of particular classes of electrical goods are financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. These directives assign levels of responsibility to companies doing business in European Union markets based on their relative market share. These directives call on each European Union member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. As additional European Union member states pass enabling legislation our compliance system should be sufficient to meet such requirements. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with these directives based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these directives as European Union member states implement guidance, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.\nThe EU Battery Directive is intended to cover all types of batteries regardless of their shape, volume, weight, material composition or use. It is aimed at reducing mercury, cadmium, lead and other metals in the environment by minimizing the use of these substances in batteries and by treating and re-using old batteries. This directive applies to all types of batteries except those used to protect European Member States' security, for military purposes, or sent into space. To achieve these objectives, the EU Battery Directive prohibits the marketing of some batteries containing hazardous substances. It establishes processes aimed at high levels of collection and recycling of batteries with quantified collection and recycling targets. The directive sets out minimum rules for producer responsibility and provisions with regard to labeling of batteries and their removability from equipment. Product markings are required for batteries and accumulators to provide information on capacity and to facilitate reuse and safe disposal. We currently ship our products pursuant to the requirements of the directive. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with these directives based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these directives as European Union member states implement guidance, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.\nThe China RoHS 2 directive provides a regulatory framework, including similar hazardous substance restrictions as are imposed by the EU RoHS Directive, and applies to methods for the control and reduction of pollution and other public hazards to the environment caused during the production, sale, and import of EEP in China affecting a broad range of electronic products and parts. The regulatory framework of China RoHS 2 also now references the updated marking and labeling requirements under Standard SJ/T 11364-2014 (\u201cMarking Standard\u201d). The methods under China RoHS 2 only apply to EEP placed in the marketplace in China. We believe our compliance system is sufficient to meet our requirements under China RoHS 2. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with this regulation based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.\nA number of domestic and international communities are prohibiting the landfill disposal of batteries and requiring companies to make provisions for product recycling. Of particular note are the EU Batteries Directive and the New York State Rechargeable Battery Recycling Law. We are committed to responsible product stewardship and ongoing compliance with these and future statutes and regulations. The compliance costs associated with current recycling statutes and regulations are not expected to be significant at this time. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these regulations, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates and additional laws could be enacted by these and other states which entail greater costs of compliance.\nThe U.S. and foreign governments can audit our contracts with their respective defense and government agencies and, under certain circumstances, can adjust the economic terms, delivery schedule or other terms of those contracts.\nA portion of our business comes from sales of products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments through various contracts. These contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations that lay out policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services. The regulations also contain guidelines for managing contracts after they are awarded, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience or for default. Failure to comply with the procurement laws or regulations can result in civil, criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines, penalties, suspension of payments, or suspension or disbarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\nCompliance with government regulations regarding the use of \"conflict minerals\" may result in increased costs and risks to the Company.\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Act\"), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. The disclosure rules were effective in May 2014. We are required to perform due diligence inquiries of our supply chain and publicly disclose whether we manufacture (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act. Additionally, customers typically rely on us to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products we sell. We have many suppliers, and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all. Accordingly, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products. Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.", "PERMNO": 78213, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "ULBI"}
