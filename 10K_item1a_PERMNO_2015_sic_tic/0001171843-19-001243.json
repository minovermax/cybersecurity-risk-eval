{"cik": "898437", "company": "Anika Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and could vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Competitive Position\nOur financial performance depends on the continued sales growth and increasing demand for our products and we may not be able to successfully manage the expansion of our operations.\nOur future success depends on substantial growth in product sales. There can be no assurance that such growth can be achieved or, if achieved, sustained. There can be no assurance that, even if substantial growth in product sales and the demand for our products is achieved, we will be able to:\n\u00b7 Maintain and develop the necessary manufacturing capabilities;\n\u00b7 Develop and successfully implement appropriate new commercial models to generate increased sales or obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners;\n\u00b7 Attract, retain, and integrate required key personnel; and\n\u00b7 Implement the financial, accounting, and management systems needed to manage our overall business and growing demand for our products.\nOur failure to successfully manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSubstantial competition could materially affect our financial performance.\nWe compete with many companies, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialized medical products companies, and healthcare companies. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs, more extensive intellectual technology portfolios, more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations, and more experience in the regulatory process than us. We also compete with academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations that may be involved in research, development, and commercialization of products similar to our own. Because a number of companies are developing or have developed HA products for similar applications and have received FDA approval, the successful commercialization of a particular product will depend in part upon our ability to complete clinical studies and obtain FDA marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors, or, if regulatory approval is not obtained prior to our competitors, to identify markets for our products that may be sufficient to permit meaningful sales of our products. For example, we are aware of several companies that are developing and/or marketing products utilizing HA for a variety of human applications. In some cases, competitors have already obtained product approvals, submitted applications for approval, or have commenced human clinical studies, either in the United States or in certain foreign countries. For example, certain HA products made by our competitors for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the knee received FDA approval before ours and have been marketed in the United States since 1997, as well as select markets in Canada, Europe, and other countries. In addition, the market for our current or future products could be adversely impacted if disruptive technologies or modalities are developed by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from a small number of customers, the loss of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have historically derived the majority of our revenues from a small number of customers who resell our products to end-users, and most of these customers are significantly larger companies than us. For the year ended December 31, 2018, five customers accounted for 86% of product revenue, with Mitek alone accounting for 73% of product revenue. We expect to continue to be dependent on a small number of large customers, especially Mitek, for the majority of our revenues in the near-term future. The failure of these customers to purchase our products in the amounts they historically have or in amounts that we expect would seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, if present and future customers terminate their purchasing arrangements with us, significantly reduce or delay their orders, or seek to renegotiate their agreements on terms less favorable to us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. If we accept terms less favorable than the terms of the current agreements, such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Furthermore, in any future negotiations we may be subject to the perceived or actual leverage that these customers may have given their relative size and importance to us. Any termination, change, reduction, or delay in orders could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Accordingly, unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base, or develop alternative commercial strategies, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future purchases by our largest customers, and the financial and operational success of these customers. The loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers, even if only temporary, could reduce or delay our recognition of revenues, harm our reputation in the industry, and reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow, and, as a consequence, it could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur license agreements with Mitek provide substantial control of the U.S. marketing and development of MONOVISC and ORTHOVISC to Mitek, and Mitek\u2019s actions could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Mitek MONOVISC Agreement and Mitek ORTHOVISC Agreement provide Mitek with, among other things, the exclusive right to market and sell MONOVISC and ORTHOVISC in the United States, unilateral decision-making authority over the sale, price, and promotion of MONOVISC and ORTHOVISC, substantial control over the future development of MONOVISC and ORTHOVISC related to the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis, a license to manufacture and have manufactured such products in the event that we are unable to supply Mitek with ORTHOVISC or MONOVISC in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement, and certain rights of first refusal with respect to future products we develop for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. In exchange, Mitek pays us a transfer price calculated with reference to historical end-user prices in the market and a fixed royalty on their net product sales. As Mitek accounts for a large percentage of our yearly revenue and has unilateral decision-making authority over in-market activities, including end-user pricing and discounts, reimbursement strategy, and overall promotion strategy, actions taken by Mitek could impact our ability to predict and generate revenue and have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon marketing and distribution partners and the failure to maintain strategic alliances on acceptable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThough we intend to implement a hybrid commercial approach in the United States in the near-term and evaluate future opportunities for the optimal commercial approach, our success will remain dependent, in part, upon the efforts of our marketing and distribution partners and the terms and conditions of our relationships with such partners. One partner, Mitek accounted for 73% of our product revenue in fiscal year 2018. We cannot assure you that our partners, including Mitek, will not seek to renegotiate their current agreements on terms less favorable to us or terminate such agreements. A failure to renew these partnerships on terms satisfactory to us, or at all, could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe continue to seek to establish long-term distribution relationships in regions and countries not covered by existing agreements, and we may need to obtain the assistance of additional marketing partners to bring new and existing products to market and to replace certain marketing partners. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or engage appropriate distribution or collaboration partners or effectively transition to any such new partnerships. The failure to establish strategic partnerships for the marketing and distribution of our products on acceptable terms and within our planned timeframes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs our international sales and operations grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional economic, political, and other risks that could harm our business.\nSince we manufacture our products for sale worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, 19%, 20%, and 19%, respectively, of our product sales were to international distributors. We continue to be subject to a variety of risks, which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international and domestic operations. These risks include:\n\u00b7 The impact of recessions and other economic conditions in economies, including Europe in particular, outside the United States;\n\u00b7 Instability of foreign economic, political, and labor conditions;\n\u00b7 Unfavorable labor regulations applicable to our European operations, such as severance and the unenforceability of non-competition agreements in the European Union;\n\u00b7 The impact of strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns, grievances, complaints, claims of unfair labor practices, or other collective bargaining disputes;\n\u00b7 Difficulties in complying with restrictions imposed by regulatory or market requirements, tariffs, or other trade barriers or by U.S. export laws;\n\u00b7 Imposition of government controls limiting the volume of international sales;\n\u00b7 Longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u00b7 Potentially adverse tax consequences, including, if required or applicable, difficulties transferring funds generated in non-U.S. jurisdictions to the United States in a tax efficient manner;\n\u00b7 Difficulties in protecting intellectual property, especially in international jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 Difficulties in managing international operations; and\n\u00b7 Burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these and any new risks. We cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Commercialization Activities\nWe cannot be certain that we will be successful or timely in implementing changes to our current commercial model in the United States, including the hybrid commercial approach we intend to utilize for the commercialization of our injectable, HA-based surgical bone repair product and certain potential future products, and our failure to do so could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nFor near-term opportunities in the U.S. market, including for our injectable, HA-based surgical bone repair product, we intend to utilize hybrid commercial approach that would see us balance a small direct model with an optimal form of strategic partnership. For longer-term future products in the U.S. market, we intend to evaluate the appropriate commercial model for each on a case-by-case basis, based on market dynamics and other factors. These models could include direct sales, distribution partnerships, or a hybrid of those forms. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in implementing these models, including the hybrid commercial approach, as we may not be able to attract or retain the sophisticated personnel required for such approach, to identify or negotiate favorable or acceptable terms with a desirable strategic partner, to timely execute on our strategies, or to generate meaningful sales of our products as a result of other market dynamics. Our failure to successfully or timely augment our current commercial model could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are facing a delay in the pathway to commercialize our CINGAL product in the United States, and we may face other unforeseen difficulties and delays in achieving regulatory approval for CINGAL, which could affect our business and financial results.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we received and analyzed the results of our second Phase III clinical trial for CINGAL and found that, while substantial pain reduction associated with CINGAL was evident at each measurement point, the data did not meet the primary study endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant difference in pain reduction between CINGAL and the approved steroid component of CINGAL at the six-month time point. After completing the analysis of the data related to the totality of our studies for CINGAL, we recently met with FDA to discuss a potential approval pathway for CINGAL in the United States moving forward. In the meeting, FDA indicated that an additional Phase III clinical trial would be necessary to support U.S. marketing approval for CINGAL, and we are continuing to align with FDA on the parameters and requirements for this additional clinical trial, which we expect to commence once alignment is achieved. Because these results or other unforeseen future developments could have a substantial negative impact on the timeline for and the cost associated with a potential CINGAL regulatory approval, if any, our overall business condition, financial results, and competitive position could be affected.\nWe must achieve market acceptance of our products in order to be successful in the future.\nOur success will depend in part upon the acceptance of our existing and future products by the medical community, hospitals, physicians, other health care providers, third-party payers, and end-users. Such acceptance may depend upon the extent to which the medical community and end-users perceive our products as safer, more effective, or more cost-competitive than other similar products. Ultimately, for our new products to gain general market acceptance, it may also be necessary for us to develop marketing partners or viable commercial strategies for the distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance on a timely basis, or at all. Failure of some or all of our future products to achieve significant market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSales of our products are largely dependent upon third party reimbursement and our performance may be harmed by health care cost containment initiatives or decisions of individual third party payers.\nIn the United States and other foreign markets, health care providers, such as hospitals and physicians, that purchase health care products, such as our products, generally rely on third party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and other health insurance and managed care plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the health care product. We have generally depended upon the distributors of our products to secure reimbursement and reimbursement approvals. Reimbursement by third party payers, both in the United States and internationally, may depend on a number of factors, including the individual payer\u2019s determination that the use of our products is clinically useful and cost-effective, medically necessary, and not experimental or investigational. Since reimbursement approval is required from each payer individually, seeking such approvals can be a time consuming and costly process which, in the future, could require us or our marketing partners to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer separately. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products, and any failure or delay in obtaining reimbursement approvals can negatively impact sales of our new products. In addition, we cannot be certain that payers who currently provide reimbursement for our products will continue to provide such reimbursement in the future, and such payer decisions could negatively impact the sales of our current or future products.\nIn addition, third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain the costs of health care products and services by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA, or the applicable foreign regulatory agency, has granted marketing approval. Also, the U.S. Congress, certain state legislatures, and certain foreign governments and regulatory agencies have considered reforms, including, among other items, the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, which may affect current reimbursement practices and create additional uncertainty about the pricing of our products, including the potential implementation of controls on health care spending through limitations on the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending. There can be no assurance that third party reimbursement coverage will be available or adequate for any products or services developed by us. Outside the United States, the success of our products is also dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement and health care payment systems. Domestic and international reimbursement laws and regulations may change from time to time. Lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement provided by governments and other third party payers for our products and services, including continuing coverage for MONOVISC and ORTHOVISC in the United States, and any change of classification by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions or if we are excluded from being a supplier by a group purchasing organization or similar entity.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms have been launched by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to curb these costs. As a result, there has been a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and may continue to become more intense. This may result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important markets as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions. If a group purchasing organization excludes us from being one of their suppliers, our net sales could be adversely impacted. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products.\nWe experience quarterly sales volume variation, which makes our future results difficult to predict and makes period-to-period comparisons potentially not meaningful.\nWe experience quarterly fluctuations in our products sales as a result of multiple factors, many of which are outside of our control. These quarterly fluctuations create uncertainty as to the volume of sales that we may achieve in a given period. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis might not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results could be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue because a proportionately smaller amount of our expenses varies with our revenue. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict, even in the near term.\nRisks Related to Our Product Development and Regulatory Compliance\nFailure to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, FDA or other U.S. and foreign governmental approvals for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral of our current products, and any future products we may develop, will require clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy for United States and international marketing approval by regulatory bodies, including the FDA. Product development and approval within the FDA framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept submissions related to our new products or the expansion of the indications of our current products, and, even if submissions are accepted, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will grant approval for our new products, including CINGAL, HYALOFAST, or other line extensions of our current products, or for the expansion of indications of our current products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are subject to other existing and future federal, state, local, and foreign regulations applicable to product approval, which may vary significantly across jurisdictions. Additional approval of existing products may be required when changes to such products may affect the safety and effectiveness, including for new indications for use, labeling changes, process or manufacturing changes, the use of a different facility to manufacture, process or package the device, and changes in performance or design specifications. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals of our products, including any changes to existing products, could have an adverse material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if ultimately granted, FDA and international regulatory approvals may be subject to significant, unanticipated delays throughout the regulatory approval process. Internally, we make assumptions regarding product approval timelines, both in the United States and internationally, in our business planning, and any delay in approval could materially affect our competitive position in the relevant product market and our projections related to future business results.\nWe cannot be certain that product approvals, both in the United States and internationally, will not include significant limitations on the product indications, and other claims sought for use, under which the products may be marketed. The relevant approval or clearance may also include other significant conditions of approval such as post-market testing, tracking, or surveillance requirements. Any of these factors could significantly impact our competitive position in relation to such products and could have a negative impact on the sales of such products.\nOnce obtained, we cannot guarantee that FDA or international product approvals will not be withdrawn or that relevant agencies will not require other corrective action, and any withdrawal or corrective action could materially affect our business and financial results.\nOnce obtained, marketing approval can be withdrawn by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies for a number of reasons, including the failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Regulatory authorities could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of our products. Any regulatory limitations on the use of our products or any withdrawal or suspension of approval or rescission of approval by the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, and our failure to comply may result in substantial penalties, including recalls of our products.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies impose extensive regulations applicable to our operations and products, including regulations governing product standards, packing requirements, labeling requirements, quality system and manufacturing requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and maintain compliance required for FDA, CE marking, or other foreign regulatory approvals for any or all of our operations and products or that we will be able to produce our products in a timely and profitable manner while complying with applicable requirements.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in substantial penalties, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant pre-market clearance or pre-market approval for devices or drugs, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecution. Additionally, regulatory authorities have the power to require the recall of our products. It also might be necessary for us, in applicable circumstances, to initiate a voluntary recall per regulatory requirements of one or several of our products. The imposition of any of the foregoing penalties, whether voluntarily or involuntary, could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny changes in FDA or international regulations related to product approval or approval renewal, including those currently under consideration by FDA or those that apply retroactively, could adversely affect our competitive position and materially affect our business and financial results.\nFDA and foreign regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and we cannot assure you that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, with possible retroactive effect, will not adversely affect us. Additionally, any changes, whether in interpretation or substance, in existing regulations or policies, or any future adoption of new regulations or policies by relevant regulatory bodies, could prevent or delay approval of our products. In the event our future, or current, products, including HA generally, are classified, or re-classified, as human drugs, combination products, or biologics by the FDA or an applicable international regulatory body, the applicable review process related to such products is typically substantially longer and substantially more expensive than the review process to which they are currently subject as medical devices. In 2018, FDA publicly indicated its intent to consider HA products for certain indications for regulation as a drug and has indicated that industry should submit new products or indication expansions to the OCP to designate the appropriate FDA office for review. There exists uncertainty with respect to the final interpretation, implementation, and consequences of this development, and this or any other potential regulatory changes in approach or interpretation similar in substance to those mentioned in this paragraph and affecting our products could materially impact our competitive position, business, and financial results.\nAdditionally, the implementation of the new European Medical Device Regulation (\u201cEU MDR\u201d), set to take full effect in 2020, is expected to change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework in Europe. Specifically, the EU MDR will require changes in the clinical evidence required for medical devices, post-market clinical follow-up evidence, annual reporting of safety information for Class III products, and bi-annual reporting for Class II products, Unique Device Identification (\u201cUDI\u201d) for all products, submission of core data elements to a European UDI database prior to placement of a device on the market, reclassification of medical devices, and multiple other labeling changes. Approvals for certain of our currently-marketed products could be curtailed or withdrawn as a result of the implementation of the EU MDR, and acquiring approvals for new products could be more challenging and costly. For example, the CE Mark indication for MONOVISC of the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis in all synovial joints was limited to the knee joint by our notified body as a result of the EU MDR, pending our generation of adequate data to support the broader indication previously granted. We do not expect this limitation to have a material impact on MONOVISC\u2019s revenue generation, but compliance with this and any other requirements could be time consuming and costly, and our failure to comply may subject us to significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe may rely on third parties to support certain aspects of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our products, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have hired experienced clinical development and regulatory staff, and we have also retained the services of knowledgeable external service providers, including consultants and clinical research organizations, to develop and supervise our clinical trials and regulatory processes. Despite our internal investment in staffing, we will remain dependent upon these third-party contract research organizations to carry out portions of our clinical and preclinical research studies for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have had and will have less control over the conduct of the clinical trials, the timing and completion of the trials, the required reporting of adverse events, and the management of data developed through the trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely on our own staff. Outside parties may have staffing difficulties, may undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed, adversely affecting their willingness or ability to conduct our trials. Failure by these third parties to comply with regulatory requirements or to meet timing expectations may require us to repeat clinical or preclinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process, or require substantial unexpected expenditures.\nWe are subject to various healthcare laws and regulations, and any failure to comply with applicable laws could subject us to significant liability and harm our business.\nOur business involves substantial interaction and collaboration with healthcare professionals, including physician consultants, clinical investigators, and actual and potential customers. These relationships are subject to federal and state healthcare laws, as well as equivalent foreign regulations. These statutes and regulations include, without limitation, false claims laws, anti-kickback regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. Any failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and any failure to comply with applicable laws could subject us to significant liabilities and harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and foreign government regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used in the manufacture of our products. Any failure by us to control the use, disposal, removal, or storage of hazardous chemicals or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe actively explore acquisitions as a part of our future growth strategy, which exposes us to a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations.\nOur business and future growth strategy includes as an important component the acquisition of businesses, technologies, services, or products that we believe are a strategic fit with or otherwise provide value to our business. We may fund these acquisitions by utilizing our cash, incurring debt, issuing additional shares of our common stock, or by other means. Completed acquisitions may expose us to a number of risks and expenses, including unanticipated liabilities, amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives, or risks associated with entering new markets with which we have limited experience or where commercial alliances with experienced partners or existing sales channels are not available. Whether or not completed, acquisitions may result in diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and significant expenditures.\nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of any completed acquisitions, including growth synergies and cost savings from the integration of acquired businesses or assets with our existing operations and technologies, as rapidly as expected, or at all. In addition, the integration and reorganization processes for our acquisitions may be complex, costly, and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing, and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies. Moreover, we may lose key clients or employees of acquired businesses as a result of the change in ownership to us. Following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition. Acquisitions may also result in one-time charges, such as write-offs or restructuring charges, impairment of goodwill or acquired In-Process Research and Development, which could adversely affect our operating results. The failure to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisition may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nWe routinely consider the acquisition of other businesses. However, we may not locate suitable acquisition targets or have the opportunity to make acquisitions of such targets on favorable terms, which could negatively impact the growth of our business. In order to pursue such opportunities, we may require significant additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Our current or potential competitors, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do, may compete with us to acquire compatible businesses, which would increase the acquisition prices and could cause us to expend significant time and funds on acquisitions we are unable to complete.\nThe acquisitions we have made or may make in the future may make us the subject of lawsuits from either an acquired company\u2019s stockholders, an acquired company\u2019s previous stockholders, or our current stockholders.\nWe may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquired company\u2019s stockholders, an acquired company\u2019s previous stockholders, or our current stockholders. These lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition target prior to the date of the acquisition, from the acquisition transaction itself, or from actions after the acquisition. Defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and distract management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business. Additionally, these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of, or the inability to renew, certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets.\nCustomer and employee uncertainty about the effects of any acquisitions could harm us.\nCustomers of any companies we acquire may, in response to the consummation of the acquisitions, delay or defer purchasing decisions, which could adversely affect the success of our acquired businesses. Similarly, employees of acquired companies may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing, and technical personnel following an acquisition.\nWe may seek additional financing in the future, which could be difficult to obtain and which could dilute your ownership interest or the value of your shares.\nOur future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend, however, on numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7 Market acceptance of our existing and future products;\n\u00b7 The success and sales of our products under various distributor agreements and other appropriate commercial strategies, including the ability of our partners to achieve third party reimbursement for our products;\n\u00b7 The successful commercialization of products in development through appropriate commercial models and marketing channels;\n\u00b7 Progress in our product development efforts;\n\u00b7 The magnitude and scope of such product development efforts;\n\u00b7 Any potential acquisitions of products, technologies, or businesses;\n\u00b7 Progress with preclinical studies, clinical trials, and product approvals and clearances by the FDA and other agencies;\n\u00b7 The cost and timing of our efforts to manage our manufacturing capabilities and related costs;\n\u00b7 The cost of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the cost of defending any other legal proceeding;\n\u00b7 Competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7 The development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products;\n\u00b7 The terms of such strategic alliances, including provisions (and our ability to satisfy such provisions) that provide upfront and/or milestone payments to us; and\n\u00b7 The cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demand.\nTo the extent funds generated from our operations, together with our existing capital resources, are insufficient to meet future requirements, we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings, through strategic alliances with corporate partners and others, or through other sources. The terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to our investors and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants, which limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action. Our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets at the time we seek financing. No assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise.\nOur manufacturing processes involve inherent risks, and disruption could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe operation of biomedical manufacturing plants involves many risks, including the risks of breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the occurrence of natural and other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements of directives of government agencies, including the FDA. In addition, we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain key raw materials and a small number of suppliers for a number of other materials required for the manufacturing and delivery of our HA products. Although we believe that alternative sources for many of these and other components and raw materials that we use in our manufacturing processes are available, we cannot be certain that the supply of key raw materials, specifically HA, will continue be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our future needs. Any supply interruption could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. We may not be able to find sufficient alternative suppliers in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired.\nWe use raw materials derived from animal sources to produce certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to utilize this source of material in the future.\nOur manufacturing processes and research and development efforts for some of our ophthalmic and veterinary products involve products derived from animals. We procure our animal-derived raw materials from a qualified vendor, who controls for contamination and has processes that effectively inactivate infectious agents; however, we cannot assure you that we can completely eliminate the risk of transmission of infectious agents. Furthermore, regulatory authorities could in the future impose restrictions on the use of animal-derived raw materials that could impact our business.\nThe utilization of animals in research and development and product commercialization is subject to increasing focus by animal rights activists. The activities of animal rights groups and other organizations that have protested animal based research and development programs or boycotted the products resulting from such programs could cause an interruption in our manufacturing processes and research and development efforts. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to the events described above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations during the period of such operational difficulties and beyond.\nWe lease properties in the United States and Italy, and there is no guarantee that these leaseholds will be without issue or sufficient to support future growth.\nWe lease approximately 134,000 square feet of administrative, research and development, and manufacturing space in Bedford, MA and approximately 33,000 square feet of office, research and development, training, and warehousing space in Padova, Italy. The current term of the Bedford lease extends to 2022, and the current term of the Padova lease extends to 2032, each with several options for renewal.
