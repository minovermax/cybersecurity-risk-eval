{"cik": "772406", "company": "CIRRUS LOGIC, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks. The risk factors set forth below may not be the only risks that we face and there is a risk that we may have failed to identify all possible risk factors. Additional risks that we are not aware of yet or that currently are not material may adversely affect our business operations. You should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other Cirrus Logic filings with the SEC. These cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of Cirrus Logic and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies such as ours.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturing and supply chain relationships for all of our products. Our reliance on third-party foundries and suppliers involves certain risks that may result in increased costs, delays in meeting our customers\u2019 demand, and loss of revenue.\nWe do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility and do not have the resources to manufacture our products internally. We use third parties to manufacture, assemble, package, and test the vast majority of our products. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with these third parties, including:\n\u25aainsufficient capacity available to meet our demand on time;\n\u25aainability for our suppliers to obtain the equipment or replacement parts necessary to fully operate their facilities or expand available manufacturing capacity;\n\u25aainadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs;\n\u25aainability of these third parties to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials;\n\u25aaextended lead times on supplies used in the manufacturing of our products;\n\u25aadifficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors;\n\u25aalimited warranties on products supplied to us;\n\u25aapotential increases in prices (including the cost of freight); and\n\u25aaincreased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nOutside of our long-term supply agreement for wafer fabrication supply with GlobalFoundries, our outside foundries and assembly and test suppliers generally manufacture our products on a purchase order basis, and we have few other long-term supply arrangements with these suppliers. Therefore, our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are not obligated to supply us with products for any specific period of time, quantity, or price, except as may be provided in any particular purchase order or in relation to an existing supply agreement. A manufacturing or supply disruption experienced by one or more of our outside suppliers or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry could negatively impact the production of certain of our products for a substantial period of time.\nWe have experienced the effects of industry-wide manufacturing capacity constraints. These supply challenges are currently limiting our ability to fully satisfy increases in demand for some of our products. We do not typically manufacture the majority of these products at more than one foundry or more than one assembly and test subcontractor, and the costs and effort associated with the potential transfer of any portion of our supply chain to a backup supplier would likely be substantial. Therefore, if one or more of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are not able to provide us sufficient capacity to meet our current demand, we may not be able to ship our products to customers on time and in the quantity requested, which could cause an unanticipated decline in our sales and damage our existing customer relationships and our ability to establish new customer relationships. Capacity constraints could further result in increased prices in our supply chain, which, if we are unable\nto increase our selling prices or if we have previously committed to pricing, could result in lower revenues and margins that could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our products. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between our manufacturer and us. This risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers, increasing the effort and time required to identify, communicate, and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls. These risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery, which would harm our profitability and customer relationships.\nIn some cases, our requirements may represent a small portion of the total production of the third-party suppliers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower-volume process that it uses to produce our parts. We cannot provide any assurance that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of parts for our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based. Each of these events could increase our costs, lower our gross margin, and cause us to hold more inventories, or materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time.\nWe have a long-term capacity reservation and wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries, which includes obligations to purchase wafers from GlobalFoundries through calendar year 2026. If our requirements are different from the number of wafers that we have committed to purchase from GlobalFoundries, or if GlobalFoundries is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIn an effort to alleviate some of our future expected supply constraints, the Company entered into a Capacity Reservation and Wafer Supply Commitment Agreement with GlobalFoundries on July 28, 2021 to reserve capacity and set wafer pricing for products purchased pursuant to the agreement through 2026.\nAlthough we believe this agreement is a good use of our financial resources and secures capacity for certain products through 2026, the agreement with GlobalFoundries involves certain risks that may result in excess inventory, place us at a competitive disadvantage, have a negative impact on our liquidity, or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is required to purchase, and GlobalFoundries is required to supply, a certain number of wafers on a quarterly basis. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable wafer purchase requirements, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the agreement sets forth pricing for wafer purchases pursuant to the agreement through 2026. If market conditions change and wafer prices in the market decrease significantly below what is contemplated in the agreement, the agreement may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nEven with a long-term supply agreement, we are still subject to risks that GlobalFoundries will be unable to meet their supply commitments, achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, manufacture our products on a timely basis, or provide additional wafer capacity beyond its current contractual commitments sufficient to meet our customers' product demands. If so, we may experience delays in product launches or supply shortages for certain products, which could cause an unanticipated decline in our sales and damage our existing customer relationships and our ability to establish new customer relationships. In addition, if GlobalFoundries experiences financial difficulties or goes into bankruptcy, it could be difficult or impossible, or may require substantial time and expense, for us to recover any or all of our prepayments made as part of the agreement.\nAny of the foregoing could materially harm our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and could put us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers and distributors for a substantial portion of our sales, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, or pricing on products sold to, any key customer or distributor could significantly reduce our sales and our profitability.\nWhile we generate sales from a broad base of customers worldwide, the loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales or selling prices to any key customer, or reductions in selling prices made to retain key customer relationships, would significantly reduce our revenue, margins, and earnings and adversely affect our business. For each of the twelve-month periods ending March 26, 2022, March 27, 2021, and March 28, 2020, our ten largest end customers represented approximately 93 percent of our sales. For the twelve-month periods ending March 26, 2022, March 27, 2021, and March 28, 2020, we had one end customer, Apple Inc., who purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 79 percent, 83 percent and 79 percent of the Company\u2019s total sales, respectively.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25aamost of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty;\n\u25aaour agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products;\n\u25aamany of our customers have pre-existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect the customers\u2019 decisions to purchase our products;\n\u25aamany of our customers have sufficient resources to internally develop technology solutions and semiconductor components that could replace the products that we currently supply in our customers\u2019 end products;\n\u25aaour customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products; and\n\u25aaour customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which increases their negotiating leverage with us and their ability to either obtain or dual source components from other suppliers.\nIn addition, our dependence on a limited number of key customers may make it easier for them to pressure us on price reductions. We have experienced pricing pressure from certain key customers and we expect that the average selling prices for certain of our products will decline from time to time, potentially reducing our revenue, margins, and earnings.\nOur key customer relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges. Our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet tight development schedules. In addition, we have, and may again in the future, entered into customer agreements providing for exclusivity periods during which we may only sell specified products or technology to a specific customer. Even without exclusivity periods, the products that we develop are often specific to our customer's system architecture and frequently cannot be sold to other customers. Accordingly, we may have to devote a substantial amount of resources to strategic relationships, which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects or the development of next generation products and technologies.\nMoreover, our reliance on certain customers may continue to increase, which could heighten the risks associated with having key customers, including making us more vulnerable to significant reductions in revenue, margins and earnings, pricing pressure, and other adverse effects on our business.\nThe lack of diversification in our revenue and customer base increases the risk of an investment in our company, and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and stock price may deteriorate if we fail to diversify.\nAlthough we continue to investigate, invest in, and try to develop opportunities to diversify our revenue and customer base, our sales, marketing, and development efforts have historically been focused on a limited number of customers and opportunities. Many companies have the ability to manage their risk by product, market, and customer diversification. However, we lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and scope of our business, which increases the risk of an investment in our company. If we cannot diversify our customer and revenue opportunities, our financial condition and results of operations could deteriorate.\nOur results may be affected by fluctuation in sales in the consumer electronics and smartphone markets.\nBecause we sell products primarily in the consumer electronics and smartphone markets, we are likely to be affected by any decrease in demand or unit volumes, seasonality in the sales of our products, and the cyclical nature of these markets. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, slowing growth in a maturing smartphone market, due to, among other factors, market saturation in developed countries, lengthening replacement cycles, and a growing market for refurbished devices. Further, a decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending relating to economic conditions, inflationary pressures, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, oil prices, global health conditions, natural disasters, and/or the political stability of countries in which we operate or sell products could have an adverse effect on consumer demand in these markets, which would likely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely impacted by global economic conditions. As a result, our financial results and the market price of our common shares may decline.\nGlobal economic conditions could make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause global businesses to defer or reduce spending on our products, or increase the costs of manufacturing our products. During challenging economic times our customers and distributors may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would increase. Additionally, if our own supply chain or others from whom our customers source are financially impacted and ultimately unable to deliver their required component(s), then our customers may delay or cancel their orders from us.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery. However, several jurisdictions in which we operate are experiencing and may continue to experience an increase in inflationary pressures and increased interest rates. This could have an adverse effect on the spending patterns of our existing and potential customers, which could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. If the economy or markets in which we operate were to continue to deteriorate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could have an adverse impact on our business operations and sales.\nThe United States or foreign governments may enact changes in government trade policies that could adversely impact our ability to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries. For example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain Chinese imports, and, in return, the Chinese government has imposed or proposed tariffs on certain U.S. products. Additionally, export restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, including the addition of licensing requirements by the BIS through the addition of companies to the BIS Entity List as well as trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. related to goods imported from regions in China with records of forced labor and other human rights issues, may require us to suspend our business with certain international customers and/or manufacturing entities if we conclude or are notified by the U.S. government that such business presents a risk of noncompliance with U.S. regulations. We cannot predict what actions may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in response. It also may not be possible to anticipate the timing or duration of such tariffs, export restrictions, or other regulatory actions. These government trade policies may materially adversely affect sales and operations with current customers and impede our ability to develop relationships with new customers.\nWhile we have received licenses from the U.S. government to export certain items to companies on the BIS Entity List, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for the manufacture or sale of future products or for other entities if the U.S government adds other companies to the BIS Entity List and/or subjects them to additional trade restrictions. Despite our receipt of licenses, BIS Entity List restrictions may also encourage foreign customers to seek a greater supply of similar or substitute products from competitors or other third parties who are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions, especially as the Chinese government develops its domestic semiconductor industry. If export restrictions and tariffs are sustained for a long period of time, or increased, or if other export restrictions are imposed in the future, our long-term competitiveness as a supplier, particularly in China, will likely be impacted.\nThere is a risk of further escalation and retaliatory actions between the U.S. and other foreign governments. If significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on goods exported from China or any related countermeasures are taken, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. These tariffs may also make our customers\u2019 products more expensive for consumers, which may reduce consumer demand.\nThe U.S. government also may seek to implement more protective trade measures, not just with respect to China but with respect to other countries as well. This could include new or higher tariffs and even more restrictive trade barriers, such as prohibiting certain types of, or all, sales of certain products or products sold by certain parties into the U.S. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade could have a materially adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nSystem security and data breaches, cyber-attacks and other related cyber security incidents could disrupt our internal operations and/or supply chain, result in the loss of our, our customers' and our suppliers' proprietary and confidential information, adversely impact our reputation and business, and result in potentially significant expenses, costs, liabilities and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely affect results of operations and our stock price.\nDespite implementing security measures, we are subject to risk, both at Cirrus Logic and through our supply chain, of attack from malicious threat actors, which could include agents of organized crime or nation-state or nation-state supported actors. We manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our employees. In addition, we manage and store a significant amount of proprietary and sensitive or confidential information from third parties, such as our customers and suppliers. Unauthorized insiders and/or third-party threat actors may be able to penetrate our security measures, evade our controls, or exploit vulnerabilities in our systems or our third-party providers' systems and misappropriate or compromise our, our customers' or our suppliers' proprietary and confidential information, including intellectual property and personal information of our current and former employees, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Threat actors also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, phishing attempts, ransomware, and other malicious software that attack our websites, computer systems, access to critical information, products, or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities. The sophistication, scale and frequency of cyber-attacks has continued to increase and evolve at a rapid pace, and the risk of attack may be heightened when our employees are working remotely or as a result of geopolitical events, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our prioritization of security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities may prove inadequate and we may be unable to anticipate or protect against attacks. If an incident occurs, we may be unable to detect it for an extended period of time.\nAny breach of our security measures or the loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our customers, our suppliers or our employees, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data, could result in numerous risks and adverse consequences. Such consequences include remediation costs, litigation and potential liability for us, including as a result of U.S. or foreign governmental investigations or enforcement actions, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, including laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of user and other personally identifiable information and data, damage to our brand and reputation, the loss of sales and customer or supplier relationships, negative impacts to our employee recruiting and retention, loss of intellectual property protection, risk of inadequate insurance coverage and increased insurance premiums, and numerous other financial, legal and business risks, any or all of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in significant stock price volatility. In addition to our own systems, our business also is reliant upon the security of various third parties in our supply chain, and any breach of their systems and securities could result in our being subjected to the numerous risks and adverse consequences noted above.\nWe face risks related to global health epidemics that could impact our sales, supply chain and operations, resulting in significantly reduced revenue and operating results.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic related to a novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"). With the pandemic on-going, we are unable to predict the full extent and nature of the impact that COVID-19 may have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely heighten or exacerbate many of the other risks described in the risk factors listed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAny increase in the severity of the outbreak or additional government measures restricting movement or business operations due to COVID-19, could cause a disruption to our supply of products to our customers - particularly with respect to the manufacture of semiconductor wafers that would have to go through extensive qualification to relocate manufacturing to a different fabrication facility. Although the U.S. and U.K. governments have eased restrictions and adopted plans for \u201cliving with COVID\u201d, the Chinese government\u2019s zero-COVID strategy has continued to result in business disruptions. Even if our suppliers and service providers are operational, other third-party suppliers may be closed or not fully operational, resulting in a shortage of some components needed for our products or our customers\u2019 end products. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers and their contract manufacturers would likely impact our inventory, backlog, sales, and operating results, as customers may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice. In addition, we have seen some reductions in commercial airline and cargo flights, and disruption to ports and other shipping infrastructure that resulted in increased transport times and costs, which, if those disruptions were to intensify, could affect our ability to timely deliver our products.\nAlthough we did not experience a significant reduction in our overall productivity due to COVID-19 in fiscal year 2022, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, disruptions to our business operations, including those resulting from remote work arrangements, the implementation of certain measures at our facilities worldwide to protect our employees\u2019 health and safety, government stay-at-home directives, quarantines, self-isolations, travel restrictions, or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to develop and design our products in a timely manner, meet required milestones, or win new business. Any increased or additional disruptions to our business operations would likely impact our ability to continue to maintain current levels of productivity.\nIn the longer term, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, which could lead to a global economic downturn or recession. If this were to occur, it may adversely affect demand for our and our customers' products, which may negatively affect our revenue and operating results.\nOur sales could be materially impacted by the failure of other component suppliers to deliver required parts needed in the final assembly of our customers\u2019 end products.\nThe products we supply our customers are typically a portion of the many components provided from multiple suppliers to complete the final assembly of an end product. If other component suppliers are unable to deliver their required component(s) for the final end product to be assembled, our customers may delay, or ultimately cancel, their orders from us.\nIf we fail to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to develop, market, or sell our products or successfully manage our business.\nCompetition for highly qualified personnel in our industry, particularly for employees with technical backgrounds, is intense. The number of technology companies in the geographic areas in which we operate is greater than it has been historically. In addition, some companies in our industry have announced plans to adopt flexible remote work arrangements that further increase competition for talent. Accordingly, we expect competition for qualified personnel to intensify because there are only a limited number of individuals in the job market with the skills that we require.\nThere also is a risk that changes in immigration laws and regulations, or their administration or enforcement, can impair our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering personnel. In the U.S., where a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment teams are located, tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the employment status of non-U.S. engineers and other key technical employees or further impact our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees. Moreover, certain immigration policies in the U.S. may make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the U.S., additionally limiting the pool of available talent. In the U.K., where we maintain several design centers, changes to the immigration system brought about by Brexit will likely make it more difficult to employ E.U. nationals to work in the U.K., also limiting our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel.\nThere are significant costs to the Company associated with attracting and retaining qualified personnel in key technology positions. Recruiting and employee costs, such as cash and stock-based compensation, have increased relative to historic levels and may continue to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, the loss of the services of key personnel or our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills or to assimilate talent could restrict our ability to develop new products or timely enhance existing products, sell products to our customers, or manage our business effectively.\nStrong competition in the semiconductor market may harm our business.\nOur industry is intensely competitive and is frequently characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, technological obsolescence, and a push towards IC component integration. Because of shortened product life cycles and even shorter design-in cycles in a number of the markets that we serve, our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next-generation systems. As markets mature and components become commoditized, competitors that can tolerate lower margins/operating income pose a risk to our profitability and growth. In the event that competitors succeed in supplanting our products, our market share may not be sustainable and our net sales, gross margin and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe compete in a number of markets. Our principal competitors in these markets include AKM Semiconductor Inc., Analog Devices Inc., Goodix Technology, Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Richtek Technology, Shanghai Awinic Technology Co., Ltd., Skyworks Solutions Inc., Southchip Semiconductor Technology (China), ST Microelectronics N.V., Synaptics Incorporated and Texas Instruments, Inc. Many of these competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, technical, distribution, and other resources; broader product lines; and broader intellectual property portfolios. We also expect intensified competition from emerging companies and from customers who develop their own IC products or other technologies. In addition, some of our current and future competitors maintain their own fabrication facilities, which could benefit them in connection with cost, capacity, and technical issues.\nWe cannot provide assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products, reduce selling prices, and increase expenses, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we depend on subcontractors internationally to perform key manufacturing functions for us, we are subject to political, economic, climate and natural disaster risks that could disrupt the fabrication, assembly, packaging, or testing of our products.\nWe depend on third-party subcontractors, primarily in Asia, for the fabrication, assembly, packaging, and testing of most of our products. International operations may be subject to a variety of risks, including political instability, global health conditions, currency controls, exchange rate fluctuations, changes in import/export regulations, tariff and freight rates, as well as the risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods. The potential physical impacts of climate change, including high heat events, power or water shortages, fires, rising sea levels, changes in storm patterns or intensities, or other extreme weather conditions, are uncertain and could impact operations at our subcontractors. Any disruption to our manufacturing cycle could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nAlthough we seek to reduce our dependence on any one subcontractor, the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured by TSMC at fabs in Taiwan, and GlobalFoundries in Singapore and Germany. This concentration of subcontractors and manufacturing operations, subjects us to the risks of conducting business internationally, including associated political and economic conditions. If we experience manufacturing problems at a particular location, or a supplier is unable to continue operating due to financial difficulties, natural disasters, political or economic turmoil or conflict, or other reasons, we would be required to transfer manufacturing to a backup supplier. Transferring from a primary supplier to another facility would likely result in increased production costs and a delay in production. Further, such a transition may not be possible, particularly in a supply constrained environment. There are only a few foundries that are currently available for certain advanced processing technologies that we utilize or may utilize. As a result, delays in our production or shipping by the parties to whom we outsource these functions could reduce our sales, damage our customer relationships, and damage our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFor example, we rely on several third-party suppliers located in Taiwan. Any deterioration in the social, political, or economic conditions in Taiwan may disrupt our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations. Similarly, our operations also could be harmed, and our costs could increase, if Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine results in a shortage of materials that our suppliers require to manufacture our products.\nIn general, our customers may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without incurring significant penalties; therefore, our sales and operating results in any quarter are difficult to forecast.\nIn general, we rely on customers issuing purchase orders to buy our products rather than long-term supply contracts. Customers may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without incurring significant penalties. This risk is potentially heightened for those customers with whom we have less experience regarding the reliability of their forecasts. While the industry is experiencing manufacturing capacity constraints, it is also possible that some customers may place orders for our products that exceed their actual demand and may cancel all or portions of their order if circumstances change. Cancellations, reductions, or delays of orders from any significant customer could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBecause our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term, we likely will be unable to adjust spending on a timely basis to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales and our operating results could be harmed.\nWe are subject to risks relating to product concentration.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to represent a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Customer acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:\n\u25aaa decline in demand for any of our more significant products;\n\u25aaa decline in the average selling prices of our more significant products;\n\u25aafailure of our products to achieve continued market acceptance;\n\u25aacompetitive products;\n\u25aanew technological standards or changes to existing standards that we are unable to address with our products;\n\u25aamanufacturing or supply issues that prevent us from meeting our customers\u2019 demand for these products;\n\u25aaa failure to release new products or enhanced versions of our existing products on a timely basis; and\n\u25aathe failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance.\nWe have significant international sales, and risks associated with these sales could harm our operating results.\nInternational sales represented 98 percent of our net sales in each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, and 99 percent of our net sales in fiscal year 2020. We expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of product sales. This reliance on international sales subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated with political and economic instability, global health conditions, currency controls, exchange rate fluctuations, changes in import/export regulations, and tariff and freight rates. For example, the political or economic instability in a given region may have an adverse impact on the financial position of end users in the region, which could affect future orders and harm our results of operations. Our international sales operations involve a number of other risks including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaunexpected changes in government regulatory requirements;\n\u25aasales, VAT, or other indirect tax regulations and treaties and potential changes in regulations and treaties in the United States and in and between countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;\n\u25aachanges to countries\u2019 banking and credit requirements;\n\u25aachanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including as a result of geopolitical conflict;\n\u25aadelays resulting from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for technology, particularly in China;\n\u25aaany changes in U.S. trade policy, including potential adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, higher tariffs, or cross border taxation by the U.S. government involving other countries, particularly China, that might impact overall customer demand for our products or affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products overseas;\n\u25aatariffs and other barriers and restrictions, particularly in China;\n\u25aacompetition with non-U.S. companies or other domestic companies entering non-U.S. markets in which we operate;\n\u25aalonger sales and payment cycles;\n\u25aaproblems in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25aathe burdens of complying with a variety of non-U.S. laws; and\n\u25aachanges to economic, social, or political conditions in countries such as China, where we have significant operations.\nIn addition, our competitive position may be affected by the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. While our sales are predominately denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products in non-U.S. markets and make our products relatively more expensive. We cannot provide assurances that regulatory, political, and other factors will not adversely affect our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices.\nOur international operations subject our business to additional political and economic risks that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to international sales constituting a large portion of our net sales, we maintain international operations, sales, and technical support personnel. International expansion has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. There are risks inherent in expanding our presence into non-U.S. regions, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aadifficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, including compliance with local employment regulations;\n\u25aafailure in non-U.S. regions to adequately protect our intellectual property, patent, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, and other proprietary rights and the risk of potential theft or compromise of our intellectual property;\n\u25aaglobal health conditions and potential natural disasters, including those resulting from climate change;\n\u25aapower or water shortages or other operational disruptions, including those resulting from extreme weather conditions;\n\u25aapolitical, social and economic instability in international regions, including wars;\n\u25aainternational currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25aafinancial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25aavulnerability to terrorist groups targeting U.S. interests abroad;\n\u25aalegal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulatory requirements; and\n\u25aachanging U.S. regulation of foreign operations, including potential sanctions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the demands of our international operations, it may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which may create additional risks associated with our ability to successfully integrate them into our business.\nWe recently acquired Lion Semiconductor and continue to consider future acquisitions of other companies, or their technologies or products, to improve our market position, broaden our technological capabilities, and expand our product offerings. If we are able to acquire companies, products or technologies that would enhance our business, we could experience difficulties in integrating them. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aathe potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u25aaunexpected costs or incurring unknown liabilities;\n\u25aathe diversion of management resources from other strategic and operational issues;\n\u25aathe inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u25aadifficulties relating to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u25aaadverse effects on our existing customer relationships or the existing customer relationships of acquired businesses;\n\u25aathe potential incompatibility of the acquired business or their business customers;\n\u25aaadverse effects associated with entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience; and\n\u25aaacquired intangible assets, including goodwill, becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business.\nIf we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business could be harmed.\nOur products may be subject to average selling prices that decline over time. If we are unable to maintain average selling prices for existing products, increase our volumes, introduce new or enhanced products with higher selling prices, or reduce our costs, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nHistorically in the semiconductor industry, average selling prices of products have decreased over time. Moreover, our dependence on a limited number of key customers may make it easier for key customers to pressure us to reduce prices. If the average selling price of any of our products declines and we are unable to increase our unit volumes, introduce new or enhanced products with higher margins, and/or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because of procurement lead times, we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs quickly in response to any reductions in prices or sales shortfalls. Because of these factors, we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.\nStrategic and Industry Risks\nWe have entered into joint development agreements, custom product arrangements, and strategic relationships with some of our largest customers. These arrangements subject us to a number of risks, and any failure to execute on any of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have entered into joint development, product collaboration and technology licensing arrangements with some of our largest customers, and we expect to enter into new strategic arrangements of these kinds from time to time in the future. Such arrangements can magnify several risks for us, including loss of control over the development and development timeline of jointly developed products, risks associated with the ownership of the intellectual property developed pursuant to such arrangements, and increased risk that our joint development activities may result in products that are not commercially successful or that are not available in a timely fashion. In addition, any third party with whom we enter into a joint development, product collaboration, or technology licensing arrangement may fail to commit sufficient resources to the project, change its policies or priorities, or abandon or fail to perform its obligations related to such arrangement. We have previously and may in the future enter into customer product arrangements that provide for exclusivity periods during which we may only sell specified products or technologies to that particular customer. Any failure to timely develop commercially successful products through our joint development activities as a result of any of these and other challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur failure to develop and ramp new products into production in a timely manner could harm our operating results.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop new products for new and existing customers, and to introduce these products in a timely and cost-effective manner. The development of new products involves significant investment and is highly complex. From time-to-time, we have experienced delays in developing and introducing these new products. Successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaproper new product definition;\n\u25aatimely completion of design and testing of new products;\n\u25aaassisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products, including providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp;\n\u25aasuccessfully developing and implementing software necessary to integrate our products into our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25aaachievement of acceptable manufacturing yields;\n\u25aaavailability of wafer fabrication, assembly, and test capacity; and\n\u25aamarket acceptance of our products and the products of our customers.\nBoth sales and/or margins may be materially affected if new product introductions are delayed, or if our products are not designed into successive generations of new or existing customers\u2019 products. Our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could harm our business and operating results.\nIn addition, difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our products. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process, and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between our manufacturer and us. This risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers, increasing the effort and time required to identify, communicate, and resolve manufacturing yield problems. Manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls. These risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery, which would harm our profitability and customer relationships.\nWe continue to invest in research and development efforts for several new markets. If we are unable to commercialize these technologies, our future results and profits could be negatively affected.\nOur investments into new markets subjects us to additional risks. We may have limited or no experience in these markets, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These new offerings may present new and difficult challenges, including risks related to technology, customers, competitors, product cycles, customer demand, terms and conditions and other industry specific issues which could negatively affect our operating results. These developing products and market segments may not grow as significantly as projected, or at all, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments or may be required to write-down the value of certain tangible and intangible assets.\nOur products are increasingly complex and could contain defects, which could result in material costs to us.\nProduct development in the markets we serve is becoming more focused on the integration of multiple functions on individual devices. There is a general trend towards increasingly complex products, including software or firmware developed by us and/or third parties. The greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of our products increases the risk that we or our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have been shipped. Quality and reliability issues could result in material costs and other adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aareduced margins;\n\u25aadamage to our reputation;\n\u25aareplacement costs for product warranty and support;\n\u25aapayments to our customers related to recall claims, or the delivery of product replacements as part of a recall claim, as a result of various industry or business practices, contractual requirements, or in order to maintain good customer relationships;\n\u25aaan adverse impact to our customer relationships by the occurrence of significant defects;\n\u25aaa delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance;\n\u25aawriting off or reserving the value of inventory of such products; and\n\u25aaa diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts.\nIn addition, any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial losses or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability or warranty claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In particular, the sale of systems and components that are incorporated into certain applications for the automotive industry involves a high degree of risk that such claims may be made.\nWhile we believe that we are reasonably insured against some of these risks and that we have attempted to contractually limit our financial exposure with many of our customers, a warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a customer product recall, could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties developing and transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies, which could materially adversely affect our results.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity and transition our current development and production efforts to advanced manufacturing process technologies. We are currently making a significant investment to transition our products and intellectual property to next-generation circuit geometries, for example, 22 nanometers. If we are unable to reliably model behaviors required for circuit design and product requirements, then our product development may be adversely impacted. To the extent that we do not timely develop additional capacity or transition to smaller geometries, experience difficulties in shifting to smaller geometries, or have significant quality or reliability issues, our results could be materially adversely affected. Further, if there are delays from such development or transition, we may have insufficient capacity to meet customer demand, which may impact our future operating results.\nSecurity vulnerabilities may exist in our products, which could expose us to significant costs and damage our business.\nOur hardware and software products, including software tools deployed by our customers, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our products, disrupt or cause errors in our customers' products, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, or cause other destructive outcomes. A failure to prevent or mitigate such an attack could harm our business reputation, diminish our competitive position in the market, and expose us to significant expense and liability.\nThe costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, phishing attempts, ransomware, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not succeed and could result in interruptions, delays, an inability to access information, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe frequently develop our products for the specific system architecture of our customers\u2019 end products. If our customers were to change system architectures, develop competing technologies and integrated circuits, incorporate some of the functionality of our products into other parts of the system, or eliminate certain functionality that our products provide in their future end products, we risk the potential loss of revenue and reduced average selling prices.\nOur customers, particularly in the portable market, could potentially transition to different audio and system architectures, develop their own competing technologies and integrated circuits, integrate the functionality that our integrated circuits and software have historically provided into other components in their systems, or eliminate certain functionality that our products provide in their future end products. For example, some of the audio and voice functionality that we have historically provided in smartphones could be performed outside of our customers\u2019 end product. If our customers were to transition to these different system architectures or to eliminate certain functionality in their future end products, our results of operations could be adversely affected, resulting in reduced average selling prices for our components and loss of revenue.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and to preserve our other intellectual property rights covering our products. We seek patent protection for those inventions and technologies for which we believe such protection is suitable and is likely to provide a competitive advantage to us. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary technology, non-disclosure and other contractual terms, and technical measures to protect our technology and manufacturing knowledge. We actively work to foster continuing technological innovation to maintain and protect our competitive position. We cannot provide assurances that steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, that our competitors will not independently develop or design around our patents, or that our intellectual property will not be misappropriated. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. countries may not protect our intellectual property as well as the laws of the United States.\nAny of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Policing infringement of our technology is difficult, and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could be expensive, take significant time, and divert management\u2019s attention.\nFinancial Risks\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws and regulations may impact both our international and domestic tax liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\nSignificant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resulting tax liabilities. Our estimates of future taxable income and the regional mix of this income can change as new information becomes available. Any such changes in our estimates or assumptions can significantly impact our tax provision in a given period.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or the United Kingdom, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's fiscal year 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal income tax returns are under examination by the IRS. The IRS has proposed adjustments that would increase U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing matters with respect to our U.S. and U.K. affiliated companies and on May 17, 2022, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent\u2019s Report asserting additional tax of approximately $170.5 million, plus interest and imposing penalties of approximately $63.7 million. We do not agree with the IRS's positions and we intend to vigorously dispute the proposed adjustments. We intend to pursue resolution through the administrative process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals and, if necessary, through judicial remedies. We expect it could take a number of years to reach resolution on these matters. Although the final resolution of these matters is uncertain,\nthe Company believes adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes that may ultimately result. However, if the IRS prevails in these matters, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in future periods.\nShifts in industry-wide capacity and our practice of ordering and purchasing our products based on sales forecasts may result in significant fluctuations in inventory and our quarterly and annual operating results.\nShifts in industry-wide capacity from shortages to oversupply, or from oversupply to shortages, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. In addition, we may order wafers and build inventory in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers. Because our industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity, overproduction, reduced demand, order cancellations, or technological obsolescence, there is a risk that we will forecast inaccurately and produce excess inventories of particular products. In addition, if we experience supply constraints or manufacturing problems at a particular supplier, we may seek to switch suppliers or qualify additional suppliers. Other suppliers may not be available at the time we seek to switch or qualify additional suppliers. Even if additional capacity is available elsewhere, the switching and/or qualifying of additional suppliers could be an expensive process and could take as long as six to twelve months to complete, which could result in material adverse fluctuations to our operating results.\nDue to the product manufacturing cycle characteristic of IC manufacturing and the inherent imprecision in the accuracy of our customers\u2019 forecasts, product inventories may not always correspond to product demand, leading to shortages or surpluses of certain products. As a result of such inventory imbalances, future inventory write-downs and charges to gross margin may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting, excess inventory, and inventory obsolescence.\nWe have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and expect these fluctuations to continue.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales, gross margin, and operating results. If our operating results fall below expectations of market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. We are subject to business cycles and it is difficult to predict the timing, length, or volatility of these cycles. These business cycles may create pressure on our sales, gross margin, and/or operating results and make it difficult for us to predict operating results as between subsequent fiscal quarters.\nFactors that could cause fluctuations and materially and adversely affect our net sales, gross margin and/or operating results include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aathe volume and timing of orders received;\n\u25aachanges in the mix of our products sold;\n\u25aamarket acceptance of our products and the products of our customers;\n\u25aaexcess or obsolete inventory;\n\u25aapricing pressures from competitors and key customers;\n\u25aaour ability to introduce new products on a timely basis;\n\u25aathe timing and extent of our research and development expenses;\n\u25aathe failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements;\n\u25aadisruption in the supply of wafers, assembly, or test services;\n\u25aareduction of manufacturing yields;\n\u25aacertain production and other risks associated with using independent manufacturers, assembly houses, and testers; and\n\u25aaproduct obsolescence, price erosion, competitive developments, and other competitive factors.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly. This fluctuation has been or may be the result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aaactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25aaannouncements concerning our business or those of our competitors, customers, or suppliers;\n\u25aaloss of a significant customer, or customers;\n\u25aachanges in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform as anticipated by the analysts;\n\u25aanews, commentary, and rumors emanating from the media relating to our customers, the industry, or us. These reports may be unrelated to the actual operating performance of the Company, and in some cases, may be potentially misleading or incorrect;\n\u25aaannouncements regarding technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25aaannouncements by us of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25aaannouncements by us of significant divestitures or sale of certain assets or intellectual property;\n\u25aalitigation arising out of a wide variety of matters, including, employment matters and intellectual property matters;\n\u25aadeparture of key personnel;\n\u25aaa significant stockholder selling for any reason;\n\u25aageneral conditions in the IC industry; and\n\u25aageneral market conditions and interest rates.\nOur foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon financial results.\nAs a global enterprise, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our assets, including certain bank accounts, exist in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies, which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies are principally the British Pound Sterling. We also have a significant number of employees that are paid in foreign currency, the largest group being United Kingdom-based employees who are paid in British Pounds Sterling.\nIf the value of the U.S. dollar weakens relative to these specific currencies, the cost of doing business in terms of U.S. dollars rises. With the growth of our international business, our foreign currency exposures may grow and under certain circumstances, could harm our business.\nIf we do not hedge against these risks, or our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur debt obligations may be a burden on our future cash flows and cash resources.\nOn July 8, 2021, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the \u201cSecond Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) which provides for a $300 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 8, 2026 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). As of March 26, 2022, the Company did not have an outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent the Company has an outstanding balance, our ability to repay the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations or to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, or refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Second Amended Credit Agreement.\nOur Second Amended Credit Agreement contains restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Second Amended Credit Agreement contains various covenants that could limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions under certain conditions. These covenants could limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25aapay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u25aaincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u25aamake certain investments;\n\u25aasell certain assets;\n\u25aacreate liens;\n\u25aaconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u25aaenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. In the event of a default under the Second Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If our lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not be able to repay our debt obligations. If we were unable to repay amounts due to the lenders under our credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. A violation of these export control regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.\nThe nature of our international business subjects us to the export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce. Any changes regarding such regulations or U.S. trade policy more generally, including potential adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or export controls, particularly with respect to China, may impact overall customer demand for our products or affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products overseas. Additionally, in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government has imposed numerous export controls and sanctions related to Russia.\nAlthough we currently have licenses to export certain products and technologies, particularly to China, and we have historically had limited sales to companies in Russia, any alleged violation could expose us to significant cost, with any final determination of a violation of these export control regulations potentially resulting in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. Although we are not aware of any violation of any export control regulations, a failure to comply with any of these regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nPotential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights.\nThe IC industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We may find it necessary to initiate lawsuits to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights. These legal proceedings could be expensive, take significant time, and divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot provide assurances that we will ultimately be successful in any lawsuit, nor can we provide assurances that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. We cannot provide assurances that rights granted under our patents will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.\nAs is typical in the IC industry, our customers and we have, from time to time, received and may in the future receive, communications from third parties asserting patents, mask work rights, or copyrights. In the event third parties were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license was not available on commercially reasonable terms, our operating results could be harmed. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our management, technical and financial resources, may also be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. An unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our future operations and/or liquidity.\nWe have provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could prevent, delay, or impede a change of control of our company. These provisions could affect the market price of our stock.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if our stockholders support the acquisition. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aathe inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25aaa prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u25aaa requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover laws of Delaware that may prevent, delay, or impede a third party from acquiring or merging with us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Bylaws include a forum selection provision that could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims, or limit the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction,\na state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders. The forum selection provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims, or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholder finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in the Company\u2019s Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company could incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risks\nCorporate social responsibility initiatives, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") matters, may impose additional costs and expose us to emerging areas of risk.\nProviding public disclosures regarding ESG matters, for example sustainability reporting, is becoming more broadly expected by investors, shareholders, existing and potential employees, customers, and other third parties. Certain organizations currently, and other organizations may in the future, use such disclosures to evaluate companies regarding ESG activities and publish scores or ratings based upon ESG or \u201csustainability\u201d metrics. Potential and current investors may use the Company\u2019s ESG ratings to guide their investment strategies and may decrease or withdraw investment, or alternatively increase investment in our competitors, if our ESG performance is perceived to be lagging. The qualitative and quantitative criteria regarding ESG may continue to evolve and we may need to modify our practices and/or incur additional or unexpected costs to satisfy these expectations. We may communicate certain goals or initiatives regarding our ESG activities from time to time, including goals relating to our carbon footprint, and if we are unable to meet those goals or they are perceived to be inadequate, we could be exposed to reputational damage and other emerging areas of risk.\nIn addition, one or more of our customers have also requested, and other customers may in the future request, that we achieve certain carbon emission reductions. Such requests may require us to modify our supply chain practices, make capital investments to modify certain aspects of our operations or increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our climate goals or the goals of our customers will be achieved or that any future investments that we make in furtherance of achieving our climate goals or the goals of our customers will produce the expected results or meet increasing stakeholder environmental, social and governance expectations. If we do not meet these goals, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction or the loss of business from certain of our customers, which could adversely impact our reputation, and in turn adversely impact our results of operations.\nFurther, we are subject to increased government laws, regulations, and other standards that impose operational and reporting requirements related to ESG matters, and we will likely be subject to further evolving ESG reporting standards in the future. Collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics in response to these increased requirements can be costly, difficult, and time consuming. With these additional regulations and disclosures, we may see our legal compliance, financial reporting and auditing costs increase along with the emergence of risks associated with the collection, data assurance, and disclosure related to such ESG information.\nAs we carry only limited insurance coverage, uninsured or under-insured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents, and we do not have coverage for certain losses. For example, there is limited coverage available with respect to the services provided by our third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. Although we believe that our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practices of companies in our industry, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against product recalls, natural disasters, cybersecurity and/or information security breaches, and other unforeseen catastrophes that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning real property.\nWe currently own our U.S. headquarters and research facility in Austin, Texas. The ownership of our U.S. properties subjects us to the risks of owning real property, which may include:\n\u25aathe possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with correcting any environmental problems;\n\u25aaadverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors; and\n\u25aathe risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of fire, floods, or other natural disasters.", "PERMNO": 75603, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "CRUS"}
