{"cik": "315131", "company": "PHX MINERALS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-12-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our financial condition could be materially impacted, and the holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in the Company. As the owner of mineral fee interests and non-operating working interests, we do not operate any natural gas and oil properties, and we do not have any employees or contractors in the field. As such, the risks associated with natural gas and oil operations affect us indirectly and typically through our non-operating working interests as we proportionately share in the costs of operating such wells. The risk factors described below are not exhaustive, and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our Company and our business. Investors should also read the other information in this Form 10-K, including the financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe volatility of natural gas and oil prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nThe supply of and demand for natural gas, oil and NGL impact the prices we realize on the sale of these commodities and, in turn, materially affect our financial results. Our revenues, operating results, cash available for distribution and the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. Natural gas, oil and NGL prices have historically been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. The prices for natural gas, oil and NGL are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022economic, political, regulatory and tax developments;\n\u2022market uncertainty;\n\u2022changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas, oil and NGL, both domestically and abroad;\n\u2022the impacts and effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022availability and capacity of necessary transportation and processing facilities;\n\u2022commodity futures trading;\n\u2022regional price differentials;\n\u2022differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude);\n\u2022differing quality and NGL content of natural gas produced;\n\u2022conservation and environmental protection efforts;\n\u2022the level of imports and exports of natural gas, oil and NGL;\n\u2022political instability or armed conflicts in major natural gas and oil producing regions;\n\u2022actions taken by OPEC or other major natural gas, oil and NGL producing or consuming countries;\n\u2022technological advancements affecting energy consumption and energy supply;\n\u2022the level of prices and expectations about future prices of natural gas and oil;\n\u2022the level of global natural gas and oil exploration and production;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering natural gas and oil;\n\u2022the price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022the ability of members of OPEC to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022speculative trading in natural gas and crude oil derivative contracts;\n\u2022weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022risks associated with operating drilling rigs;\n\u2022the price and availability of, and competition from, alternative fuels;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East;\n\u2022social unrest, political instability or armed conflict in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the U.S., such as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia;\n\u2022the proximity, cost, availability and capacity of natural gas and oil pipelines and other transportation facilities; and\n\u2022overall domestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future natural gas, oil and NGL price movements with any certainty. If the prices of natural gas, oil and NGL decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves may be materially and adversely affected. Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement, which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders.\nLow natural gas, oil and NGL prices for a prolonged period of time would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult to predict future natural gas, oil and NGL price movements with any certainty. Natural gas, oil and NGL prices continued to fluctuate in fiscal year 2022, with the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to contribute to volatility and uncertainty. Our financial position, results of operations, access to capital and the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL that may be economically produced would be negatively impacted if natural gas, oil and NGL prices were low for an extended period of time. The ways in which low prices could have a material negative effect include the following:\n\u2022significantly decrease the number of wells operators drill on our acreage, thereby reducing our production and cash flows;\n\u2022cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves and maintain or increase production;\n\u2022future undiscounted and discounted net cash flows from producing properties would decrease, possibly resulting in recognition of impairment expense;\n\u2022certain reserves may no longer be economic to produce, leading to lower proved reserves, production and cash flow;\n\u2022access to sources of capital, such as equity and debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable; and\n\u2022we may incur a reduction in the borrowing base on our credit facility.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, as well as heightened volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas. The negative impact on worldwide demand for oil and natural gas resulting from COVID-19 led to a precipitous decline in oil prices, further exacerbated by the early March 2020 failure by OPEC+ to reach an agreement over proposed oil production cuts and global storage considerations. Although OPEC+ subsequently agreed to cut oil production, crude oil prices remained depressed as a result of an increasingly utilized global storage network and the decrease in crude oil demand due to COVID-19. Since then, oil and natural gas prices have risen, but such prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of multiple factors, including COVID-19 and related measures taken by governments around the world, and as changes in oil and natural gas inventories, oil demand and economic performance are reported. Although government response measures to COVID-19 have generally relaxed, the ultimate impact of this pandemic is uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the reemergence of widespread COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 variants, the pandemic\u2019s severity, actions to contain the disease or mitigate its impact and the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Declines in oil prices due to COVID-19 could result in the events discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We are unable to predict the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business, which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, including the pandemic\u2019s ongoing effect on the demand for oil and natural gas and the response of the overall economy and the financial markets after the pandemic and response measures come to an end, the timing of which remains highly uncertain.\nThe conflict in Ukraine and related price volatility and geopolitical instability could negatively impact our business.\nIn late February 2022, Russia launched significant military action against Ukraine. The conflict has caused, and could intensify, volatility in natural gas, oil and NGL prices, and the extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have a substantial negative impact on the global economy and/or our business for an unknown period of time. There is evidence that the increase in crude oil prices during the first half of calendar year 2022 was partially due to the impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the global commodity and financial markets, and in response to economic and trade sanctions that certain countries have imposed on Russia. Any such volatility and disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nLower natural gas, oil and NGL prices or negative adjustments to natural gas, oil and NGL reserves may result in significant impairment charges.\nWe have elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas and oil exploration and development activities. Exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit-of-production method (the ratio of natural gas, oil and NGL volumes produced to total proved or proved developed reserves) as natural gas, oil and NGL are produced.\nAll long-lived assets, principally our natural gas and oil properties, are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset on our books may be greater than our future net cash flows. The need to test a property for impairment may result from declines in natural gas, oil and NGL sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. The decision to not participate in future development on our leasehold acreage can trigger a test for impairment. Also, once assets are classified as held for sale, they are reviewed for impairment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. If an impairment charge is recognized, cash flow from operating activities is not impacted, but net income and, consequently, stockholders\u2019 equity are reduced. In periods when impairment\ncharges are incurred, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 11 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d for further discussion on impairment under the heading \u201cImpairment.\u201d\nOur future success depends on developing our existing inventory of mineral acreage and acquiring additional mineral interests. Failure to develop our existing inventory of mineral acreage and to acquire additional mineral interests will cause reserves and production to decline materially from their current levels.\nThe rate of production from natural gas and oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Our proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced except to the extent that we acquire additional mineral interests on properties containing proved reserves and our lessees or well operators conduct additional successful exploration and development drilling, successfully apply new technologies or identify additional behind-pipe zones (different productive zones within existing producing well bores) or secondary recovery reserves.\nDrilling for natural gas and oil invariably involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, completion, operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve a targeted rate of return. We rely on third-party operators\u2019 interpretation of seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying prospects and in conducting exploration and development activities. Nevertheless, prior to drilling a well, the seismic data and other technologies used do not allow operators to know conclusively whether natural gas, oil or NGL is present in commercial quantities.\nCost factors can adversely affect the economics of any project, and the eventual cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is controlled by well operators and existing market conditions. Further, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;\n\u2022lack of availability to market production via pipelines or other transportation;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022environmental hazards or liabilities;\n\u2022lack of water disposal facilities;\n\u2022governmental regulations;\n\u2022cost and availability of drilling rigs, equipment and services; and\n\u2022expected sales price to be received for natural gas, oil or NGL produced from the wells.\nCompetition for acquisitions of mineral interests may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Further, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently hold properties, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business or assets into our existing\noperations. The process of integrating acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable mineral interest acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our growth, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nAny acquisition of additional mineral and royalty interests that we complete will be subject to substantial risks.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022the validity of our assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, prices, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs;\n\u2022a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash generated from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;\n\u2022mistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;\n\u2022our ability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire;\n\u2022an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; and\n\u2022the occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of natural gas and oil properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIt is not possible to measure underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGL with precision. Natural gas, oil and NGL reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGL using assumptions concerning future prices of these commodities, future production levels and operating and development costs. In estimating our reserves, we and our Independent Consulting Petroleum Engineer must make various assumptions with respect to many matters that may prove to be incorrect, including:\n\u2022future natural gas, oil and NGL prices;\n\u2022unexpected complications from offset well development;\n\u2022production rates;\n\u2022reservoir pressures, decline rates, drainage areas and reservoir limits;\n\u2022interpretation of subsurface conditions including geological and geophysical data;\n\u2022potential for water encroachment or mechanical failures;\n\u2022levels and timing of capital expenditures, lease operating expenses, production taxes and income taxes, and availability of funds for such expenditures; and\n\u2022effects of government regulation.\nIf any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of reserves, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our reserves could change significantly.\nOur standardized measure of oil and natural gas reserves is calculated using the 12-month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month individual product prices for each month within the 12-month period prior to September 30. These prices and the operating costs in effect as of the date of estimation are held flat over the life of the properties. Production and income tax expenses are deducted from this calculation of future estimated development, with the result discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future net revenue in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production.\nThe reserve estimates made for fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy records. A lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures. Further, our lack of knowledge of all individual well information known to the well operators such as incomplete well stimulation efforts, restricted production rates for various reasons and up-to-date well production data, etc. may cause differences in our reserve estimates.\nBecause PUD reserves, under SEC reporting rules, may only be recorded if the wells they relate to are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of recording, the removal of PUD reserves that are not developed within this five-year period may be required. Removals of this nature may significantly reduce the quantity and present value of our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. Please read Item 2 - \u201cProperties - Proved Reserves\u201d and Note 16 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nSince forward-looking prices and costs are not used to estimate discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves, the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.\nThe timing of the development and production on our properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor used when calculating discounted future net cash flows, in compliance with the FASB statement on oil and natural gas producing activities disclosures, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company, or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nDebt level and interest rates may adversely affect our business.\nOn September 1, 2021, we entered into a four-year Credit Agreement (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with certain lenders and Independent Bank, as Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Issuer (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior revolving credit facility set forth in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 25, 2013, as amended, among the Company, each lender party thereto, and BOKF, NA dba Bank of Oklahoma, as administrative agent, which we repaid in full and terminated. As of September 30, 2022, we had a balance of $28,300,000 drawn on our credit facility set forth in the Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility). The Credit Facility\u2019s borrowing base is set at $50,000,000. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our personal property and at least 80% of the total value of the proved, developed and producing Oil and Gas Properties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) owned by the Company.\nShould we incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Facility to fund capital projects or for other reasons, there is a risk this could adversely affect our business operations as follows:\n\u2022cash flows from operating activities required to service indebtedness may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022covenants contained in the Credit Agreement may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022any limitation on the borrowing of additional funds may affect our ability to fund capital projects and may also affect how we will be able to react to economic and industry changes;\n\u2022a significant increase in the interest rate under the Credit Facility will limit funds available for other purposes; and\n\u2022changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our capability to meet our interest payments, as the Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates.\nThe borrowing base of our Credit Facility is subject to periodic redetermination and is based in part on natural gas, oil and NGL prices. A lowering of our borrowing base because of lower natural gas, oil or NGL prices, or for other reasons, could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the established borrowing base, or we might need to further secure the debt with additional collateral. Our ability to meet any debt obligations depends on our future performance. General business, economic, financial and product pricing conditions, along with other factors, affect our future performance, and many of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants relating to our Credit Facility could result in a default, which might adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties we own.\nConsistent with industry practice, we do not have current abstracts or title opinions on all of our mineral acreage and, therefore, cannot be certain that we have unencumbered title to all of these properties. Our failure to cure any title defects that may exist may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. There is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we may suffer a financial loss.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and most of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe compete in the highly competitive areas of natural gas and oil acquisition, development, exploration and production. We face intense competition from both major and independent oil and natural gas companies to acquire desirable producing properties, new properties for future exploration and human resource expertise necessary to effectively develop properties. We also face similar competition in obtaining sufficient capital to maintain or grow production.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cyber-attacks or other breaches in data security.\nThe oil and natural gas industry in general has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain exploration, development and production activities. We use digital technology to estimate quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, process and record financial data and communicate with our employees and third parties. Power, telecommunication or other system failures due to hardware or software malfunctions, computer viruses, vandalism, terrorism, natural disasters, fire, human error or by other means could significantly affect our ability to conduct our business. Though we have implemented complex network security measures, stringent internal controls and maintain offsite backup of all crucial electronic data, there cannot be absolute assurance that a form of system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations results. For instance, unauthorized access to our reserves information or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption or other disruptions in our operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nOur derivative activities may reduce the cash flow received for natural gas and oil sales.\nIn order to manage exposure to price volatility on our natural gas and oil production, we currently, and may in the future, enter into natural gas and oil derivative contracts for a portion of our expected production. Natural gas and oil price derivatives may limit the cash flow we actually realize and therefore reduce our ability to fund future projects. None of our natural gas and oil price derivative contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, all changes in fair value of derivative contracts are reflected in earnings. Accordingly, these fair values may vary significantly from period to period, materially affecting reported earnings. In addition, this type of derivative contract can limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for natural gas and oil. The fair value of our natural gas and oil derivative instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2022, was a net liability of $8,561,191.\nThere is risk associated with our derivative contracts that involves the possibility that counterparties may be unable to satisfy contractual obligations to us. If any counterparty to our derivative instruments were to default or seek bankruptcy protection, it could subject a larger percentage of our future natural gas and oil production to commodity price changes and could have a negative effect on our ability to fund future acquisitions.\nPlease read Item 7A - \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d and Note 1 and 12 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding derivative contracts.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud could occur and not be detected.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur in the future and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, such as the material weakness we previously discovered and disclosed, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could negatively affect our business and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public equity or debt markets for capital.\nFuture legislative or regulatory changes may result in increased costs and decreased revenues, cash flows and liquidity.\nCompanies that operate wells in which we own a working interest are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. We, as a working interest owner, are therefore indirectly subject to these same regulations. New or changed laws and regulations such as those described below could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, changes in law or regulation related to hydraulic fracturing or greenhouse gases could potentially increase capital, compliance and operating costs significantly, as well as halt or delay the further development of oil and gas reserves on our properties.\nFederal Income Taxation\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income or capital-based taxes in various states, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay. Income taxes are assessed on our revenue after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. Changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow.\nCertain beneficial provisions within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017 are set to be reduced beginning in 2023 and beyond, such as a reduction in the amount of immediate bonus depreciation available for qualified property placed into service.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d), which was signed into law in August 2022, includes several provisions that are specifically applicable to corporations. The IRA includes an annual 15% minimum tax on corporations that have \u201caverage annual adjusted financial statement income\u201d in excess of $1 billion over a three year period. The IRA also includes a 1% tax on publicly traded corporations on the fair market value of stock repurchased during any taxable year. Such tax applies to the extent such buybacks exceed $1 million during such year, which buyback value may be offset by other stock issuances.\nAdditionally, further revisions to U.S. tax law, such as a reversal of the corporate income tax rate reduction, the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance, the repeal of expensing for intangible drilling costs or the repeal of enhanced bonus depreciation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we apply U.S. tax law, with a corresponding impact on the results of our operations for the periods affected.\nOklahoma Taxation\nOklahoma imposes a gross production tax, or severance tax, on the value of natural gas, oil and NGL produced within the state. Under Oklahoma law, the gross production tax rate on the first three years of a horizontal well\u2019s production is 5.2% and 7% thereafter. Future changes to Oklahoma production taxes could affect the profitability of wells producing natural gas, oil and NGL in Oklahoma.\nHydraulic Fracturing and Water Disposal\nThe vast majority of natural gas and oil wells drilled in recent years have been, and future wells are expected to be, hydraulically fractured as a part of the process of completing the wells and putting them on production. This is true of the wells drilled in which we own an interest. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping water, sand and additives at high pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas and oil production. In developing plays where hydraulic fracturing, which requires large volumes of water, is necessary for successful development, the demand for water may exceed the supply. A lack of readily available water or a significant increase in the cost of water could cause delays or increased completion costs.\nIn addition to water, hydraulic fracturing fluid contains chemical additives designed to optimize production. Well operators are being required in certain states to disclose the components of these additives. Additional states and the federal government may follow with similar requirements or may restrict the use of certain additives. This could result in more costly or less effective development of wells.\nOnce a well has been hydraulically fractured, the fluid produced from the fractured wells must be either treated for reuse or disposed of by injecting the fluid into disposal wells. Injection well disposal processes have been, and continue to be, studied to determine the extent of correlation between injection well disposal and the occurrence of earthquakes. Certain studies have concluded there is a correlation, and this has resulted in the cessation of or the reduction of injection rates in certain water disposal wells, especially in northern Oklahoma.\nEfforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing and fluid disposal continue at the local, state and federal level. New regulations are being considered, including limiting water withdrawals and usage, limiting water disposition, restricting which additives may be used, implementing statewide hydraulic fracturing moratoriums and temporary or permanent bans in certain environmentally sensitive areas. Public sentiment against hydraulic fracturing and fluid disposal and shale production could result in more stringent permitting and compliance requirements. Consequences of these actions could potentially increase capital, compliance and operating costs significantly, as well as delay or halt the further development of gas and oil reserves on our properties. Though the Biden administration has not proposed the outright ban of hydraulic fracturing, the administration has proposed significant regulations regarding methane emissions that could potentially affect new and existing wells, including those that are hydraulically fractured. The proposed methane rule is discussed in more detail in the Climate Change section, below.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nClimate Change\nCertain studies have suggested that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d may be impacting the earth\u2019s climate. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning natural gas and oil, are examples of greenhouse gases. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as gas and oil production equipment and operations.\nLegislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and such legislation may be proposed in the future. In addition, in December 2015, the United States joined the international\ncommunity at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, in preparing an agreement which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This \u201cParis Agreement\u201d was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016. To help achieve these reductions, federal agencies addressed climate change through a variety of administrative actions. The EPA issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that cover natural gas and oil facilities, among other industries. However, on June 1, 2017, the President of the United States announced that the United States planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations to either reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which resulted in an exit in November 2020. While the U.S. officially exited the Paris Agreement in November of 2020, the Biden administration immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement after taking office in January of 2021. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order triggering a 30-day process to re-enter the agreement.\nMore recently, the EPA issued a proposed rule to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. If adopted, states will have authority to incorporate the emission guidelines proposed by EPA or to adopt their own standards that achieve the same degree of emission limitations. The proposed rule applies to the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category, including the production, processing, transmission, and storage segments. If adopted, these rules would result in additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls or lower emitting equipment and costs to implement monitoring requirements.\nSeismic Activity\nEarthquakes in northern and central Oklahoma and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the energy industry. Legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation that could lead to operational delays, increase operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect operations.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC (the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. New or modified rules, regulations or requirements may increase the cost and availability to the counterparties of our hedging and swap positions which they can make available to us, as applicable, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities.\nWhile many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations remain to be finalized or effectuated and, therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives that we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and (iv) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nRisks Related to our Third-Party Operators\nWe cannot control activities on our properties.\nWe do not operate any of the properties in which we have an interest and have very limited ability to exercise influence over the third-party operators of these properties. Our dependence on the third-party operators of our properties, and on the cooperation of other working interest owners in these properties, could negatively affect the following:\n\u2022our return on capital used in drilling or property acquisition;\n\u2022our production and reserve growth rates;\n\u2022capital required to workover or recomplete wells;\n\u2022success and timing of drilling, development and exploitation activities on our properties;\n\u2022compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations;\n\u2022lease operating expenses; and\n\u2022plugging and abandonment costs, including well-site restorations.\nDependency on each operator\u2019s judgment, expertise and financial resources could result in unexpected future costs, lost revenues and/or capital restrictions, to the extent they would cumulatively have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe natural gas and oil drilling and producing operations of our third-party operators involve various risks.\nBecause we do not operate our properties, our business relies heavily upon our third-party operators and their operational effectiveness. Through our third-party operators, we are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of natural gas and oil properties, including:\n\u2022well blowouts, cratering, explosions and human related accidents;\n\u2022mechanical, equipment and pipe failures;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, earthquakes and other natural disasters;\n\u2022civil disturbances and terrorist activities;\n\u2022natural gas, oil and NGL price reductions;\n\u2022environmental risks stemming from the use, production, handling and disposal of water, waste materials, hydrocarbons and other substances into the air, soil or water;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022limited availability of financing;\n\u2022marketing related infrastructure, transportation and processing limitations; and\n\u2022regulatory compliance issues.\nAs a non-operator, we are also dependent on third-party operators and the contractors they hire for operational safety, environmental safety and compliance with regulations of governmental authorities.\nWe maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management to be prudent. However, this insurance does not protect us against all risks. For example, we do not maintain insurance for business interruption, acts of war or terrorism. Additionally, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. These risks could give rise to significant uninsured costs that might have a material adverse effect on our business condition and financial results.\nWe may experience delays in the payment of royalties and be unable to replace operators that do not make required royalty payments, and we may not be able to terminate our leases with defaulting lessees if any of the operators on those leases declare bankruptcy.\nA failure on the part of the operators to make royalty payments gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of our properties, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we might not be able to find a replacement operator and, if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to a proceeding under title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), in which case our right to enforce or terminate the lease for any defaults,\nincluding non-payment, may be substantially delayed or otherwise impaired. In general, in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankrupt operator would have a substantial period of time to decide whether to ultimately reject or assume the lease, which could prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator. In the event that the operator rejected the lease, our ability to collect amounts owed would be substantially delayed, and our ultimate recovery may be only a fraction of the amount owed or nothing. In addition, if we are able to enter into a new lease with a new operator, the replacement operator may not achieve the same levels of production or sell natural gas or oil at the same price as the operator it replaced.\nShortages of oilfield equipment, services, qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas, oil and NGL prices, resulting in periodic shortages. When demand for rigs and equipment increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment. Higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices generally stimulate increased demand for, and result in increased prices of, drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages or price increases could negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of our wells, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and operating results.\nThe marketability of natural gas and oil production is dependent upon transportation, pipelines and refining facilities, which neither we nor many of our operators control. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our or our operators\u2019 ability to market our or our operators\u2019 production and could harm our business.\nThe marketability of our or our operators\u2019 production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, tanker trucks and other transportation methods and processing and refining facilities owned by third parties. The amount of oil that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of available capacity on these systems, tanker truck availability and extreme weather conditions. Also, the shipment of our or our operators\u2019 natural gas and oil on third-party pipelines may be curtailed or delayed if it does not meet the quality specifications of the pipeline owners. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we or our operators are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or transportation, processing or refining-facility capacity could reduce our or our operators\u2019 ability to market oil production and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash distributions to stockholders. Our or our operators\u2019 access to transportation options and the prices we or our operators receive can also be affected by federal and state regulation-including regulation of oil production, transportation and pipeline safety-as well as by general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. In addition, the third parties on whom we or our operators rely for transportation services are subject to complex federal, state, tribal and local laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nWe may be negatively impacted by inflation.\nIncreases in inflation could have an adverse effect on us. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, and geopolitical instability, including the ongoing conflict between the Ukraine and Russia. Continuing increases in inflation could increase our costs of labor and other costs related to our business, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation has also resulted in higher interest rates in the U.S., which could increase our cost of debt borrowing in the future.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit in the European, Asian and U.S. markets contribute to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of natural gas, oil and NGL, volatility in consumer confidence and job markets, may result in an economic slowdown or recession. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which natural gas, oil and NGL from our properties are sold, affect the ability of vendors, suppliers and customers associated\nwith our properties to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. The impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nThe issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and may result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on October 19, 2020, and amendments thereto on December 10, 2020, February 8, 2021, and February 19, 2021, which the SEC declared effective on February 24, 2021 (the \u201cFebruary 2021 S-3\u201d). The February 2021 S-3 allows us to issue up to $75 million in securities including Common Stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, and is intended to provide us with increased financial flexibility and more efficient access to the capital markets. On August 25, 2021, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Stifel, as sales agent and/or principal, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through or to Stifel, up to 3,000,000 shares of our Common Stock under the February 2021 S-3. We also issue shares of our Common Stock in private transactions from time to time. During fiscal year 2022, we issued 1,519,481 shares of Common Stock in a private transaction on December 1, 2021, as consideration for the acquisition of certain mineral and royalty assets. These shares were registered with the SEC through the filing of a resale registration statement on Form S-3, which the SEC declared effective on January 27, 2022.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of these securities or the availability of the securities will have on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock from time to time. Substantial sales of shares of our Common Stock or other securities in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. Such a decrease in our share price could in turn impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, any such decline may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell shares of our Common Stock at prices they deem acceptable.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we were authorized to issue an aggregate of 54,010,500 shares of capital stock, consisting of 54,000,500 shares of Common Stock and 10,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01666 per share (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d), of which 36,528,844 shares of Common Stock and no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding on December 6, 2022. Future issuances of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock, or other securities convertible into our Common Stock or Preferred Stock, may result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. Significant dilution would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power held by our existing stockholders.\nWe may reduce or suspend our dividend in the future.\nWe have paid a quarterly dividend for many years. Our most recent quarterly dividend was $0.02 per share, and we have paid a quarterly dividend ranging from $0.01 per share or $0.04 per share for the past three years. In the future our Board may, without advance notice, determine to reduce or suspend our dividend in order to maintain our financial flexibility and best position us for long-term success. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board deems relevant. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of prolonged market weakness. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by agreements governing our indebtedness now or in the future. Although we do not currently have plans to reduce or suspend our dividend, there can be no assurance that we will not reduce our dividend or that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\nIf we cannot meet the NYSE continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, if we are unable to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, including, among other things, (i) the requirement of maintaining a minimum average closing price of $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period and (ii) the requirement of maintaining an average market capitalization of not less than $50 million over a 30 trading-day period with, at the same time, stockholders\u2019 equity not less than $50 million, we would fall below compliance standards and risk having our Common Stock delisted. In addition, in the event of an abnormally low share price of our\nCommon Stock and/or we fail to maintain an average market capitalization of at least $15 million over a 30-trading day period, we would be subject to immediate delisting under the NYSE\u2019s rules without any opportunity to cure. A delisting of our Common Stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, the following:\n\u2022causing our shares to be transferred to a more limited market than the NYSE, which could affect the market price, trading volume, liquidity and resale price of such shares;\n\u2022reducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our Common Stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity;\n\u2022decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage relating to us;\n\u2022limiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; and\n\u2022impacting our reputation and, as a consequence, our business.", "PERMNO": 77236, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PHX"}
