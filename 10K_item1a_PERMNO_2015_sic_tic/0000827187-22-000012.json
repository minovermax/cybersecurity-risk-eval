RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks set forth below and other matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties that impact the business environment generally, those not presently known to us, or those that we currently see as immaterial, may also harm our business. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to COVID-19, Economic Conditions, Consumer Sentiment and the Availability of Credit\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic, consumer, supply chain and workforce disruption, which have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations and financial results. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions and guidelines, including business closures, stay at home orders, and isolation and quarantine recommendations and requirements, adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, operations, supply chain, workforce, demand for our product, traffic to our stores, and macroeconomic factors that affect us, such as consumer confidence and spending. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions resulted in the temporary closure of most of our retail stores nationwide, with 47% of our stores closed on average during the second quarter of 2020. For the second half of 2020 and all of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our financial performance, but we were able to keep our stores open. As the pandemic continues, COVID-19, new variants, infection rates, related governmental restrictions and recommendations, and individual concerns of becoming infected may again adversely impact our stores and other business operations, including product development, manufacturing, supply, distribution, home delivery operations and staffing, which could have an adverse impact on our sales and profits. As vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19 become available and the pandemic evolves, consumer behavior may continue to evolve or change, including spending more time away from home, and discretionary consumer spending on home goods such as our smart beds and related products may decrease.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we scaled our digital and \u201csell-from-anywhere\u201d capabilities including: remote retail selling, customer service, private appointments, flexible work schedules, solutions for contactless delivery, and remote access for team members across the country. This shift to our team members working remotely has amplified certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems and increased risk of cybersecurity breaches and IT outages. In addition, as recommendations and/or mandates have been modified, eased, lifted, and in some cases re-implemented across the country, we have implemented and evolved our health and safety policies for our operations, facilities and teams across the country, which are intended to ensure the safety of our team members and customers and reduce the risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus for team members, contractors, and customers. As the coronavirus variants have changed and presented different risks, it is possible that our health and safety policies may not adequately protect our team members, contractors, and customers from contracting or spreading the coronavirus, which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or financial results.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the changes in customer purchasing patterns, supply chain constraints and workforce considerations we did, and in some situations continue to, take decisive actions to strengthen liquidity and reduce costs. It is possible that our cost reduction efforts may be insufficient to maintain adequate liquidity if our operations are further restricted or disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic or governmental recommendations or mandates, including vaccination or testing mandates that may be imposed in jurisdictions in which we operate, that may result in material impact on our sales and profits.\nAdditionally, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our Company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business and financial results in the future.\nWe are highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products. In light of COVID-19 and the overall fluid\n16 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nnature of the pandemic and the consumer environment, we may not be as successful in developing effective messages and achieving efficiency in our advertising expenditures.\nOur business depends heavily on the uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing plants, our assembly distribution centers, bedding fulfillment center, and home delivery teams across the country. Our business also depends on the successful function of our customer service operations and headquarters. The operation of all of our facilities and operations, including those of our suppliers and vendors, is critically dependent on adequate staffing by our team members or contractors, and COVID-19 could directly threaten or impact their health, ability to work, and/or willingness to work, and, therefore, adversely affect our operations and facilities. In addition, COVID-19 and governmental restrictions or recommendations, including vaccination or testing mandates, could require closures of our facilities, restrict our facilities and operations, and otherwise limit or adversely impact our ability to continue these operations and staff our facilities. COVID-19 has also adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, the global supply chain and our logistics, lead times, and delivery timeframes, including availability of raw materials, components, and products we or our suppliers source from third parties as well as our sole source of supply for certain components and products, such as adjustable foundations and certain electronic components, due to COVID-19 infection rates, new variants, workforce impacts, governmental restrictions or recommendations and spikes in demand or shortages in supply with respect to certain raw materials and components driven by other industries. This has adversely affected, and we expect will continue to adversely affect, our business operations and financial results in 2022.\nThe inability or limitations of certain suppliers, both domestic and foreign, to ramp production to meet growing or surging global demand or to operate due to the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental restrictions or recommendations, staffing or supply shortages, or a reluctant workforce has delayed and may continue to delay the introduction of new innovations and product lines.\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and the potential for an adverse effect on our business and our financial results increases the longer the virus and new variants impact activity levels in the United States and globally. For this reason, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the extent of the impact COVID-19 will have on our business. The extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations, and financial results will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, new variants, the availability, administration, and efficacy of vaccines, governmental mandates and recommendations, business and workforce disruptions, and the related impact on global and domestic supply chain and consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nCurrent and future economic conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly upon discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by a number of general economic factors, including without limitation economic growth, consumer confidence, the housing market, employment and income levels, interest rates, inflation, taxation, consumer shopping trends and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers, civil unrest, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse trends in any of these economic factors may adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nInflationary pressures stemming from supply chain disruptions, increased demand or other economic factors have resulted in increased fuel, shipping, raw material, labor and other costs, which have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations and financial results, especially if continued for a prolonged period. If our costs rise due to continuing supply chain disruptions or inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.\nA reduction in the availability of credit to consumers generally or under our existing consumer credit programs could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nA significant percentage of our sales are made under consumer credit programs through third parties. The amount of credit available to consumers may be adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors, including those related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, that affect the financial position of consumers, and as suppliers of credit adjust their lending criteria.\n17 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nSynchrony Bank provides credit to our customers through a private label credit card agreement that is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination upon certain events. Synchrony Bank has discretion to control the content of financing offers to our customers and to set minimum credit standards under which credit is extended to customers.\nReduction of credit availability due to changing economic conditions, including rising inflation, increased interest rates, changes in credit standards under our private label credit card program or changes in regulatory requirements, or the termination of our agreement with Synchrony Bank, could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties and Reliance on a Global Supply Chain\nWe could be vulnerable to shortages in supply of components necessary to manufacture our products due to our manufacturing processes which operate with minimal levels of inventory or due to global shortages of supply of electronic componentry or other materials, which may harm our ability to satisfy consumer demand and may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nA significant percentage of our products are assembled after we receive orders from customers utilizing manufacturing processes with minimal levels of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories. Lead times for ordered components may vary significantly, and some components used to manufacture our products are provided on a sole source basis. We have experienced lengthened lead times throughout our supply chain as a result of supply chain constraints and material shortages that occurred in 2021 and may continue in 2022. Our efforts to mitigate supply chain weaknesses may not be successful or may have unfavorable effects. For example, efforts to purchase raw materials in advance for product manufacturing may result in increased storage costs or excess supply. In addition, with the increasing prevalence of and consumer demand for electronic products, along with COVID-19\u2019s impact on the global supply chain, the global supply of electronic componentry is increasingly strained, which has led to shortages in supply and increased prices, and has adversely affected, and we expect may continue to adversely affect, our operations, costs, production capacity, delivery timeframe, product development, sales, profitability, and financial results. Any shortage of materials caused by any disruption or unavailability of supply or an increase in the demand for our products, has harmed and could continue to harm our ability to satisfy customer demand, delay deliveries of our products to customers, lead to customer cancellations and returns, delay the development and launch of new products, or increase our costs. Any such impacts or delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe rely upon several key suppliers and third parties that are, in some instances, the only source of supply or services currently used by us for particular materials, components, products or services. A disruption in the supply or substantial increase in cost of any of these products or services could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe currently obtain all the materials and components used to produce our smart beds from outside sources including some that are located outside the United States. In several cases, including our air chambers, integrated non-adjustable foundations, adjustable foundations, various components for our Firmness Control systems, certain electronic componentry, certain foam formulations, as well as our fabrics and zippers, we obtain these materials, components and products from suppliers who serve as the only source of supply, or who supply the vast majority of our needs of the particular material, component or product. While we believe that some of these materials, components and products, or suitable replacements, could be obtained from other sources in the event of a disruption or loss of supply, we may not be able to find alternative sources of supply or alternative sources of supply on comparable terms, quantities and timelines. If our relationship with the primary supplier of our air chambers, adjustable foundations, or electronic components is terminated or significantly disrupted, we could have difficulty in replacing these sources since there are relatively few other suppliers presently capable of manufacturing these components and products. Constraints on the ability of certain of our suppliers to timely meet commitments in an environment of increased demand for consumer products and reduced labor during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has, and may continue to, adversely impact our ability to meet our product demand, result in additional costs, or may otherwise adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.\nSimilarly, we rely on third parties to deliver some of our products to our facilities and customers on a timely and cost-effective basis. These third-party providers could be vulnerable to labor shortages, liquidity concerns, the impacts of COVID-19 or other pandemics, or other factors that may result in delays in deliveries or increased costs of deliveries. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased cancellations or returns and cause us to lose sales\n18 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nor incur increased costs. Any increase in freight charges or other costs of deliveries could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nFluctuations in commodity prices or availability or third-party logistics costs could result in an increase in component costs and/or delivery costs.\nOur business is subject to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to electronic componentry, fuel, oil, natural gas, rubber, cotton, plastic resin, corrugate, steel and chemical ingredients used to produce foam, as well as third-party logistic costs. Increases in prices of these commodities or logistics costs or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials and product components, as well as increases in the cost of delivering our products to our customers. To the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering and similar initiatives, or through price increases, our profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. If we choose to increase prices to offset the increased costs, our sales volumes could be adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to risks inherent in global sourcing activities.\nOur air chambers, certain electronic components, and some of our other components are manufactured outside the United States, and therefore are subject to risks associated with foreign sourcing of materials, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas on certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States;\n\u2022Political instability, unrest, geo-political turmoil, acts of terrorism, global conflicts or war (such as the current conflict in Ukraine), outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), shipping delays, foreign or domestic strikes, customs inspections, or other factors resulting in disruption in supply, transportation, trade, labor, or the availability of global contractors utilized in our business operations;\n\u2022Foreign currency fluctuations; and\n\u2022Economic uncertainties, including inflation.\nWe cannot predict whether the countries in which some of our components are manufactured, or may be manufactured in the future, or where we contract for labor will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. The United States government has implemented certain trade policies, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, and may take further actions with respect to these policies in the future. These factors could increase our costs of doing business with foreign suppliers, lead to inadequate inventory levels or delays in shipping beds to our customers, which could harm our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers are located in various regions of the U.S. and across the globe, which subjects us to regional risks, such as adverse weather conditions and other natural or man-made disasters.\nThe locations where we and our suppliers and global contractors operate have experienced, and may experience in the future, adverse regional events such as extreme weather conditions and other natural and man-made disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our ability to source necessary materials, components and products, and our ability to develop, launch, sell and deliver our products to customers. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters. All regions of the U.S. and warmer climates globally may be particularly impacted by extreme weather, such as hurricanes, natural disasters, droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels. These events may disrupt our operations and ability to source components and products.\nRisks Related to Our Marketing Strategy and Execution of Total Retail Distribution Strategy\nOur future growth and profitability depend upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs.\nWe are highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness, consideration and conversation leading to sales of our products. We continue to evolve our marketing strategies, adjust our messages, and review the amount we spend on advertising and\n19 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nwhere we spend it. We may not always be successful in developing effective messages, as the consumer and competition change, or in achieving efficiency in our advertising expenditures.\nWe rely in part upon third parties, such as social media influencers and athletes, to market our brand, and we are unable to fully control their efforts. Influencers and athletes with whom we maintain a relationship could engage in behavior or use their platforms to communicate directly with our customers in a manner that reflects poorly on our brand, and these communications may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. It is not possible to prevent such behavior, and the precautions we take to prevent or detect this activity may not be effective.\nConsumers are increasingly having digital experiences and interactions as a part of their shopping experience. As a result, our future growth and profitability will depend in part on (i) the effectiveness and efficiency of our online experience, including without limitation advertising and search marketing and optimization programs, in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products; (ii) our ability to prevent confusion among consumers that can result from search engines that allow competitors to use our trademarks to direct consumers to competitors\u2019 websites through confusing or misleading advertisements; (iii) our ability to prevent Internet publication of false or misleading information regarding our products or our competitors\u2019 products; (iv) reviews of our products; (v) the nature and tone of consumer sentiment, including those published online or elsewhere; and (vi) the stability of our website. In recent periods, competitor spending on digital marketing programs has increased, including without limitation from a number of direct-to-consumer, digital retailers and omnichannel retailers, which has and may continue to increase the cost of basic search terms and the cost of our digital marketing programs.\nIf our marketing messages are ineffective or our advertising expenditures and other marketing programs, including digital programs, are inefficient in creating awareness and consideration of our products and brand name, and in driving consumer traffic to our website, call centers, or stores, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. In addition, if we are not effective in preventing the publication of confusing, false or misleading information regarding our brand or our products, or if there is publication online or elsewhere of significant negative consumer sentiment regarding our Company, brand or our products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur future growth and profitability depend on our ability to execute our Total Retail distribution strategy.\nThe vast majority of our sales occur through Total Retail, including our retail stores and our website. Total Retail represents our largest opportunity for growth in sales and improvement in profitability. Our retail stores carry significant fixed costs. We also make significant capital expenditures as we open new stores and remodel or reposition existing stores. We are highly dependent on our ability to maintain and increase sales per store to cover these fixed expenses, provide a return on our capital investments and improve our operating margins.\nSome of our stores are mall-based. We depend on the continued popularity of malls as shopping destinations and the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic for our mall-based retail stores. Any decrease in mall traffic, including due to governmental recommendation or mandates related to COVID-19, could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur Total Retail distribution strategy results in relatively few points of distribution, including 648 retail stores in 50 U.S. states as of the end of 2021, Online, Phone and Chat. Several of the mattress manufacturers and retailers with which we compete have significantly more brick-and-mortar points of distribution than we do, which makes us highly dependent on our ability to drive consumers to our points of distribution to gain market share.\nOur longer-term Total Retail distribution strategy is also dependent on our ability to renew existing store leases and to secure suitable locations for new store openings, in each case on a cost-effective basis. We may encounter higher than anticipated rents and other costs in connection with managing our retail store base. We may also be unable to find or obtain suitable new locations.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product quality could negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur products are highly differentiated from traditional innerspring mattresses and from viscoelastic and other foam mattresses, which have little or no technology and do not rely on electronics and air control systems. As a result, our\n20 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nbeds may be susceptible to failures that do not exist with traditional or foam mattresses. Failure to achieve and maintain acceptable quality standards could impact consumer acceptance of our products or result in negative media and Internet reports or owner dissatisfaction that could negatively impact our brand image and sales levels.\nIn addition, a decline in product quality could result in an increase in return rates and a corresponding decrease in sales, or an increase in product warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves. An unexpected increase in return rates or warranty claims could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs a consumer innovation Company with differentiated products, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims or regulatory actions if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in personal injury or property damage. If any of our products proves to be defective or non-compliant with applicable regulations such as the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission flammability standards, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. We have at times experienced increased returns and adverse impacts on sales, as well as product liability litigation, as a result of media reports related to the alleged propensity of our products to develop mold. We may experience additional adverse impacts on sales and additional litigation if any similar media reports were to occur in the future. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be applicable to, or adequate for, liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us outside of, or in excess of, available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity about us, may have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur future growth and profitability depend in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line and to successfully execute new product introductions.\nAs described in greater detail below, the bedding industry, as well as the market for sleep monitoring products, are both highly competitive, and our ability to compete effectively and to profitably grow our market share depend in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line of adjustable firmness air beds, SleepIQ technology and related accessory products. We incur significant research and development and other expenditures in the pursuit of improvements and additions to our product line. If these efforts do not result in meaningful product improvements or new product introductions, if we are not able to gain widespread consumer acceptance of product improvements or new product introductions, or there are delays or production limitations with respect to our product improvements or new product introductions, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, if any significant product improvements or new product introductions are not successful, delayed, or constrained our reputation and brand image may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our technology or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We are from time to time subject to claims that our products, processes or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others.\nWe own various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to certain elements of the design and function of our beds and related products. We own numerous registered and unregistered trademarks and trademark applications, including in particular our Sleep Number, Sleep Number 360, 360, and SleepIQ trademarks, as well as other intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, trade dress and copyrights, which we believe have significant value and are important to the development, function, and marketing of our products. These intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection against infringement or piracy, may not prevent competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar to or competitive with our beds or other products, and may be costly and time-consuming to protect and enforce. Our patents are also subject to varying expiration dates. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our technology or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims that our products, processes, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions and liability for damages or royalty obligations, and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n21 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nRisks Related to Our Vertically Integrated Business\nSignificant competition could adversely affect our business.\nBecause of the vertical integration of our business model, our products and distribution face significant competition from both manufacturers of different types of mattresses and a variety of retailers. Our SleepIQ technology also faces significant competition from various manufacturers and retailers of sleep tracking and monitoring products.\nThe mattress industry is characterized by a high degree of concentration among the largest manufacturers of innerspring mattresses and foam mattresses and one dominant national mattress retailer. In recent years, numerous direct-to-consumer companies and low-cost importers have entered the market, offering \u201cbed-in-a-box\u201d or similar products primarily through online distribution directly to consumers though many now also partner with traditional mattress retailers. The emergence of these new competitors has increased the costs of search terms and digital advertising.\nA variety of sleep tracking and monitoring products that compete with our SleepIQ technology have been introduced by various manufacturers and retailers, both within and outside of the traditional mattress industry.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and manufacturing resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and sell products through broader and more established distribution touchpoints. Our national, exclusive distribution competes with other retailers who generally provide a wider selection of mattress alternatives than we offer. A number of these retailers also have more points of distribution, greater marketing resources, and greater brand name recognition than we do.\nThese manufacturing and retailing competitors, or new entrants into the market, may compete aggressively and gain market share with existing or new products, and may pursue or expand their presence in the adjustable firmness air bed segment of the market as well as in the market for sleep tracking and monitoring products. We have limited ability to anticipate the timing and scale of new product introductions, advertising campaigns or new pricing strategies by our competitors, which could inhibit our ability to retain or increase market share, or to maintain our profit margins.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete with other manufacturers and retailers of mattress and sleep tracking and monitoring products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nDisruption to of our manufacturing, distribution, logistics, home delivery, product development, and customer service operations could increase our costs of doing business or harm our ability to satisfy customer demand, develop and launch new products, and service our products and customers.\nWe have two main manufacturing plants, which are located in Irmo, South Carolina and Salt Lake City, Utah, and a network of several assembly distribution centers across the county. A significant percentage of our products are assembled to fulfill orders rather than stocking finished goods inventory in our plants, assembly distribution centers, or stores. We have home delivery operations and contractors that deliver our products to customers across the country as well as a bedding fulfillment center that ships bedding products to consumers via third-party services. Our product development and testing operations primarily occur in our corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Sleep Number Labs facility in San Jose, California. Our customer service operations are located in New Orleans, Louisiana and Minneapolis, Minnesota and we have retail stores across the country. Disruption to any of these operations, facilities, workforce, or our nationwide logistics network could harm or delay our ability to satisfy customer demand, develop, test and launch new products, service our products and customers, and increase our costs. Such impacts and delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial results.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance and Legal Proceedings\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of government laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, as well as any new or changed laws or regulations, could disrupt our operations or increase our compliance costs. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have further adverse impacts on our operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to the bedding industry or to various aspects of our business. Laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels frequently change and we cannot always reasonably predict the impact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, future regulatory or administrative changes. Changes in\n22 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\nlaw, the imposition of new or additional regulations or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, advertising and marketing practices, pricing, consumer credit offerings, \u201cdo not call/mail\u201d requirements, text messaging requirements, product testing and safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, accounting, privacy and data security, health and safety or environmental issues, warranty disclosures, delivery timing requirements, accessibility requirements, among others, could require us to change the way we do business and could have a material adverse impact on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. New or different laws or regulations could increase direct compliance costs for us or may cause our vendors to raise the prices they charge us because of increased compliance costs. Further, the adoption of a multi-layered regulatory approach to any one of the state or federal laws or regulations to which we are currently subject, particularly where the layers are in conflict, could require alteration of our manufacturing processes or operational parameters which may adversely impact our business.\nLegislative or regulatory changes that impact our relationship with our workforce, such as minimum wage requirements or health insurance or other employee benefits mandates, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. While it is our policy and practice to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance, we cannot assure that all of our operations will comply with all such legal and regulatory requirements. Further, laws and regulations change over time and we may be required to incur significant expenses and/or to modify our operations in order to ensure compliance. This could harm our profitability or financial condition. If we are found to be in violation of any laws or regulations, we could become subject to fines, penalties, damages or other sanctions as well as potential adverse publicity or litigation exposure. This could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur ability to commercialize new products and innovations may be delayed or prevented by regulatory requirements.\nAs we work to develop innovations with enhanced health capabilities, including possible capabilities of providing advanced monitoring and health risk evaluations, depending on the features that ultimately become commercially available, some features may require regulatory requirements or approvals beyond those that apply to our current products or features. These additional regulatory requirements or approvals may be prohibitively expensive or otherwise delay or prevent certain features, innovations, or product from being commercialized.\nPending or unforeseen litigation and the potential for adverse publicity associated with litigation could adversely impact our business, reputation, financial results or financial condition.\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including primarily commercial, product liability, employment and intellectual property claims. We currently do not expect the outcome of any pending matters to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation, however, is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate outcome of one or more pending claims asserted against us, or claims that may be asserted in the future that we are currently not aware of, or adverse publicity resulting from any such litigation, could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Information Systems and Cybersecurity\nInformation systems that contain confidential Company data, consumers\u2019 personal information, and team members\u2019 personal information may be subject to attacks by hackers or other cyber threats that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data, which could substantially disrupt our business and could result in a breach of the data.\nOur information systems and information systems of third-party vendors we use to assist in the storage and management of information, including on-premise and cloud-based systems, contain personal information related to our customers and team members collected and maintained in the ordinary course of our business, such as credit card and demographic information of our customers, SleepIQ\u00ae data, including biometric data (e.g., sleep, physiological) from our customer base and social security numbers, demographic information, and employment-related information of our team members. These information systems also contain confidential Company data regarding our business and innovations. Our use and dependence on our information systems has increased with amplified remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic and additional data storage in cloud-based systems. While we maintain and require our third-party vendors to maintain security measures to protect this information, a breach of these security measures, such as through third-party\n23 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\naction and attacks, team member error, access to our data and systems, malfeasance or otherwise, could compromise the security of our data and customers\u2019 and team members\u2019 personal information. Like many other businesses, we have and will likely continue to experience cyber-based attacks and incidents from time to time. As the techniques used to breach such security measures change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any failure of our systems and processes or our third-party vendors\u2019 systems and processes to adequately protect our data or customer or team member personal information from exposure, theft or loss could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nAny maintenance, improvements or upgrades to information systems that may be required to meet the evolving needs of our business and cybersecurity needs as well as existing and emerging regulatory requirements may be costly to implement and may take longer or require greater resources than anticipated, and may result in disruptions to our systems or business.\nWe depend on our information systems for many aspects of our business. If our information systems are disrupted in any material way, or maintenance, improvements or upgrades are required to meet the evolving needs of our business, cybersecurity needs, and existing and emerging regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in the pursuit of improvements or upgrades to our information systems. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, and may cause short-term disruptions or security vulnerabilities to our existing systems and our business. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Workforce\nOur future growth and profitability depend in part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nAs a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in a wide variety of areas to execute our growth strategy, including qualified management and executive personnel, retail sales professionals and managers, and manufacturing, home delivery and technical personnel. The current labor shortage, the world-wide trends of corporate resignations, COVID-19 or other economic factors may prevent us, and our suppliers and vendors, from successfully hiring and retaining qualified personnel. The failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and growth initiatives and may adversely impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nA substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall, which could cause investors to lose all or a portion of their investment in our stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we believe the ten largest holders of common stock were institutional investors who held approximately 58% of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate, with BlackRock Fund Advisors being our largest shareholder with approximately 14% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons, and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock, which could cause investors to lose all or a portion of their investment in our stock. In addition, any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe stock price of our Company may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors such as: the overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole; changes in the financial projections we or third parties may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections; actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to that of our competitors; failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of\n24 | 2021 FORM 10-K\nSLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION\ninvestors; and sales of share of our common stock by us or our shareholders particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders or the perception that these sales could occur.\nGeneral Risks\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from consumers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from consumers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and disclosures. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, climate change, health and safety, supply chain management, diversity, labor conditions and human rights, both in our own operations and in our supply chain. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in material increases to our overall operational costs. While we have taken steps to evolve our ESG strategy and related disclosures, including through implementing enhanced data collection methods and reporting certain data under recognized ESG reporting frameworks, our ESG practices may not meet the standards of all our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. A failure, or perceived failure, to adopt to or comply with regulatory requirements or to respond to investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our business and reputation.\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nClimate change presents various near and long-term risks that may adversely impact our business. The enactment of new laws and regulations to address or limit the effects of climate change, or changes to existing laws and regulations, could mandate more restrictive standards or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. The consequences of climate change and the ensuing governmental regulations could disrupt our operations or harm our ability to source necessary materials and components and manufacture our products, which may adversely affect our financial condition. If public perception of our compliance with laws and regulations related to climate change is negative, it could adversely affect our business, reputation and shareholder perception. Adverse publicity or climate-related litigation that impacts us could also have a negative impact on our business.\nExtreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing, distribution centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers, temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chain, logistics, or workforce and/or disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. Current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or if multiple such events occur. Climate change may also subject our business to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to electronic componentry, fuel, oil, natural gas, rubber, cotton, plastic resin, corrugate, steel and chemical ingredients used to produce foam, as well as third-party logistic costs. Further, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and our industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Any long-term disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more manufacturing, distribution centers or other facilities could have an adverse effect on our operations.", "PERMNO": 86489, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "SNBR"}
