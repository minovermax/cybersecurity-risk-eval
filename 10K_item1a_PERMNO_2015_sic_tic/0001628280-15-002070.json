{"cik": "899647", "company": "RIVIERA HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCessation of Operations and Eventual Liquidation\nAs a result of our sale of certain long-lived assets, future expected cessation of operations and eventual liquidation, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn February 20, 2015, the Company entered into, and simultaneously closed, the Purchase Agreement with Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, a local governmental entity of the State of Nevada. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Buyer purchased certain assets of the Company, including the real property located at 2901 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109 and all structures and improvements located on the property, and certain other assets. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will cease operations, and we contemplate liquidating any remaining gaming related assets. We expect the cessation of operations to involve significant expense and disruption to the business, as well as potential labor disruptions, which can adversely affect the business prior to our closure date. Additionally, our independent public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our consolidated financial statements that raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern as a result of incurring substantial losses since the Substantial Consummation Date.\nIntangibles and Other Long Lived Assets\nIf we are required to impair our intangibles or other long lived assets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nPursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we are required to perform an annual impairment review of intangibles and other long lived assets which could result in an impairment charge if it is determined that the carrying value of the assets are in excess of the fair value. We\nperform the impairment test annually during our fourth fiscal quarter. Intangibles and other long lived assets are also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists. When changes in circumstances, such as changes in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate fair value indicate the carrying amount of certain assets may not be recoverable, the assets are evaluated for impairment. If actual operating results differ from these assumptions, it may result in an asset impairment. As of December 31, 2012, management concluded indicators of impairment existed and recorded a $24.8 million goodwill impairment charge. Future write-downs of intangibles and other long lived assets could affect certain of the financial covenants under our debt agreements, could restrict our financial flexibility, and would impact our results of operations.\nLimited Operating History Under Our Management Agreement\nOur business has a limited operating history under our Management Agreement, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict.\nWhile Predecessor historically operated our casino gaming properties, we, as Successor to Predecessor, have a limited operating history under our management contract upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must do the following, among other things:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive developments; and\n\u2022\nattract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we will operate profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due. We cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful, that we will successfully address the risks that face our business or that we will be able to access the capital markets if the need arises. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSubstantial Losses\nWe have incurred substantial losses since the Substantial Consummation Date, and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe reported losses from continuing operations before income tax benefits of $18.2 million, $26.8 million and $56.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We have recognized a significant non-cash impairment charge to goodwill in 2012. There can be no assurance that we will operate profitability in the future or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.\nInsufficient Cash Flow\nWe have been unable to achieve positive cash flow which could prevent us from funding operations and servicing any future debt obligations.\nWe have been unable to generate positive cash flows since the Substantial Consummation Date. To the extent we do not achieve positive cash flows, we may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned and may be unable to service any future debt obligations we may incur as they come due, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our failure to generate positive cash flows could lead to additional cash flow and working capital constraints, which may require us to seek additional working capital. We may not be able to obtain such working capital when it is required. Further, even if we were able to obtain additional working capital, it may only be available on unfavorable terms. For example, we may be required to incur future debt, the interest costs of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If any such required capital is obtained in the form of equity, the equity interests of the holders of the then-outstanding common stock could be diluted.\nPrior Bankruptcy Filing\nThe bankruptcy filing has had a negative impact on Predecessor's image, which may negatively impact our business going forward.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, Predecessor was the subject of negative publicity which has had an impact on the image of its assets. This negative publicity may have an effect on the terms under which some customers and suppliers are willing to do business with us and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition\nWe face intense competition in the market where we operate.\nIn Las Vegas, competition has continued to increase as a result of factors such as ongoing economic uncertainty, hotel room inventory increases and gaming floor expansions in addition to convention, trade show and meeting space additions. Our success depends on the ability of Riviera Hotel & Casino to attract customers and realize corresponding revenues. Riviera Hotel & Casino competes with casino resort properties and hotels in the Las Vegas area. Currently, there are approximately 30 major gaming properties located on or near the Las Vegas Strip, approximately ten additional major gaming properties in the downtown area and many additional gaming properties located in other areas of Las Vegas. Riviera Hotel & Casino competes with these properties based on overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment offered, shopping and restaurant facilities, theme and size. Companies that own and operate multiple hotel/casino facilities operate many of the gaming properties in Las Vegas. These companies have greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do and often market to the same target demographic groups as we do.\nIn addition to the competition that we face from our competitors in Las Vegas, we face increasing competition from other companies in the gaming industry generally, such as land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on Native American land and other forms of legalized gambling. We risk losing market share if other casinos operate more successfully or are enhanced or expanded or are established in or around the locations where we conduct business.\nIn particular, the legalization of gaming or the expansion of legalized gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIncreased competition may also require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain or enhance the competitive positions of our property. Because we are highly leveraged and have considerable constraints on our available cash, we might not have sufficient financing to make such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nLas Vegas Market\nWe operate in only the Las Vegas market, which exposes us to greater risks than gaming companies with a presence in more markets.\nWe do not have material assets or operations other than Riviera Hotel & Casino. Therefore, we are entirely dependent upon this property for our cash flow. This makes us more sensitive to events and conditions affecting the market in which we operate, including the following:\n\u2022\nweak macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nweak local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nincreased competitive conditions;\n\u2022\ninaccessibility due to weather conditions, road construction or closure of primary access routes;\n\u2022\ndecline in air passenger traffic due to higher ticket costs or fears concerning air travel;\n\u2022\na decline in automobile traffic due to higher gasoline prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in state and local laws and regulations, including those affecting gaming;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of electrical power as a result of, among other things, power shortages in California or other western states with which Nevada shares a single regional power grid;\n\u2022\na decline in the number of visitors to Las Vegas;\n\u2022\na decline in hotel room rates in Las Vegas due to increased hotel room supply without offsetting hotel room demand; and\n\u2022\na potential increase in the gaming tax rate in any jurisdiction in which we operate.\nKey Personnel\nOur operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel. The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully is dependent, in part, upon the continued services of certain of our executive personnel. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or our inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegulatory Environment\nRegulations issued by gaming or other governmental authorities could adversely affect our operations.\nAs owners and operators of a gaming facility, we are subject to extensive governmental regulation. The ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive laws, regulations and ordinances, which are administered by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. The gaming authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate have broad authority and discretion to require us and our officers, directors, managers, employees and certain security holders to obtain various licenses, registrations, permits, findings of suitability or other approvals. To enforce applicable gaming regulations, gaming authorities may, among other things, limit, suspend or revoke the licenses of any gaming entity or individual, and may levy fines against us or individuals or may cause us to forfeit our assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations. Any of these actions would have a material adverse effect on us.\nNevada, state and local government authorities require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers and key employees to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. Those authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license for any cause they deem reasonable. Also, if we violate any gaming laws or regulations, those authorities may levy substantial fines against us or the individuals involved in the violations. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe cannot assure you that any new licenses, registrations, findings of suitability, permits and approvals will be granted or that our existing ones will be renewed when they expire. Any failure to renew or maintain our licenses or receive new licenses when necessary would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to zoning, environmental matters, construction, land use and the serving of alcoholic beverages. We also pay substantial taxes and fees in connection with our operations as a gaming company, which taxes and fees are subject to increases or other changes at any time. Any changes to these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur compliance costs associated with these laws, regulations and licenses are significant. A change in the laws, regulations and licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any of them could require us to make material expenditures or could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nIn other jurisdictions from which we attract customers, gaming is subject to local referendum. If the results of a referendum in a nearby non-gaming jurisdiction were to permit gaming, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nWe are subject to potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nGenerally, we are subject to various federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Failure to comply could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on our operations by governmental agencies or courts. In 2002, Riviera Hotel & Casino experienced a diesel leak. Our\ncontinuing efforts to monitor the effects of this leak have been affected by construction at neighboring projects. We are continuing to monitor this matter. In order to come to final resolution regarding this issue with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, we may be required to take remediation steps including the excavation of the affected area. We are unable to estimate the cost of remediation at the present time.\nEnergy Prices\nEnergy price increases may adversely affect our costs of operations and our revenues.\nOur casino property uses significant amounts of energy, natural gas and other forms of energy. Substantial increases in the cost of energy in the United States could have a negative effect on our operating results. The extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of energy price increases, but this impact could be material. In addition, energy price increases in cities that constitute a significant source of customers for our property could result in a decline in disposable income of potential customers and a corresponding decrease in visitation to our property which could negatively impact our revenues.\nOther Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control.\nThe economic health of our business is generally affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ncessation of operations and eventual liquidation\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions specific to our primary markets;\n\u2022\ngeneral condition of the banking and credit markets;\n\u2022\ndecline in tourism and travel due to concerns about homeland security, terrorism or other destabilizing events;\n\u2022\ndecline in the Las Vegas convention business;\n\u2022\nthe ability to renegotiate union contracts;\n\u2022\nintense competitive conditions in the gaming industry and the effect such conditions may have on the pricing of our games and products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory regimes affecting our business, including changes to applicable gaming, employment, environmental or tax regulations;\n\u2022\ninaccessibility to our property due to construction on adjoining or nearby properties, streets or walkways;\n\u2022\nsubstantial increases in the cost of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy;\n\u2022\nlocal conditions in key gaming markets, including seasonal and weather-related factors;\n\u2022\nincreased transportation costs;\n\u2022\nlevels of disposable income of casino customers;\n\u2022\ncontinued increases in health care costs;\n\u2022\nincreases in gaming taxes or fees;\n\u2022\nincreases in Clark County, Nevada facilities inspection fees and resulting remedial actions;\n\u2022\nthe relative popularity of entertainment alternatives to casino gaming that compete for the leisure dollar; and\n\u2022\nan outbreak or suspicion of an outbreak of an infectious communicable disease.\nAny of these factors could negatively impact our property or the casino industry generally, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance Limitations\nWe may incur losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.\nInsurance may not be available in the future or adequate to cover all loss or damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, insurance coverage has diminished for certain types of damages or occurrences and is no longer available at reasonable commercial rates. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses if a catastrophe or lawsuit occurs for which we do not have insurance coverage. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to pay the costs of replacing or repairing destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our debt obligations.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to litigation, which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our business, we are subject to various litigation claims and other legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, because we cannot predict the outcome of any legal action, it is possible that as a result of litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our results from operations.\nSecurity, Terrorism and War\nHomeland security, terrorism and war concerns, as well as other factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, may harm our operating results.\nThe strength and profitability of our business depend on consumer demand for hotel/casino resorts, gaming in general and the types of amenities we offer. Changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, ongoing war activities and concerns about terrorism and homeland security have had a negative impact on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. We cannot predict the extent to which those events may continue to affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. An extended period of reduced discretionary spending or disruptions or declines in travel could significantly harm our operations.\nIn addition to concerns about war, homeland security and terrorism, other factors affecting discretionary consumer spending include: consumers\u2019 confidence in general or regional economic conditions, consumers\u2019 disposable income, and consumers\u2019 fears of a continued or worsening economic recession or an economic depression. Negative changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce customer demand for the products and services we offer, thus imposing practical limits on our pricing and harming our operations.\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\nA significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements, and a dispute with covered employees may lower our revenues and increase our costs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, 699 of our 1,063 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nNet Win Volatility\nOur revenues may be negatively impacted by volatility in our hold percentage.\nCasino revenue is recorded as the difference between gaming wins and losses or net win from gaming activities. Net win is impacted by variations in the hold percentage (the ratio of net win to total amount wagered), or actual outcome, on our slot\nmachines, table games, and all other games we provide to our customers. We use the hold percentage as an indicator of a game\u2019s performance against its expected outcome. Although each game generally performs within a defined statistical range of outcomes, actual outcomes may vary for any given period. The hold percentage and actual outcome on our games can be impacted by the level of a customer\u2019s skill in a given game, errors made by our employees, the number of games played, faults within the computer programs that operate our slot machines and the random nature of slot machine payouts. If our games perform below their expected range of outcomes, our cash flow will suffer.\nCompetitive Reinvestment\nWe may need to increase capital expenditures to compete effectively but we may not have sufficient funds to do so.\nCapital expenditures, such as room refurbishments, amenity upgrades and new gaming equipment may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness of our hotel and casino. The gaming industry market is very competitive and is expected to become more competitive in the future. If cash from operations is insufficient to provide for needed levels of capital expenditures and we are unable to raise funds for such purposes elsewhere, we may be unable to make necessary improvements and our facility may be less attractive to our visitors than that of our competitors\u2019, causing us to lose our competitive position.\nTechnology and Energy Dependence\nWe are dependent upon technology services and electrical power to operate our business, and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, resulting in a decrease in revenues.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. Without electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers, we may be unable to run all or parts of gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although our systems have been designed based on industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nRiviera Brand\nOur success depends on the value of our Riviera brand.\nWe depend on the name recognition of our Riviera brand in our marketing efforts. Maintaining and building recognition of our brand are important to expanding our customer base. If the value of our brand were adversely affected, our ability to attract customers would be negatively impacted and our growth could be impaired.\nOur failure to protect our brands may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our brands or defend against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nWe believe that it is important for our business to achieve brand recognition. We rely primarily on tradenames to achieve brand recognition. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, policing unauthorized use of our trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual property can be difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We cannot give any assurance that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor. Such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention as well as expend our other resources away from our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects, and reputation.\nClimate Changes\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that emission of greenhouse gases, also referred to herein as \u201cGHGs\u201d continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. Climate change, including the impact of global warming, creates physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation\nand extreme weather events. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We have described the risks to us associated with extreme weather events in the risk factors above.\nWe may become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, stockholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Many states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions, and in the past, federal legislation has been proposed in Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. Further, regulation of GHG emissions may limit our customers' ability to travel to our properties as a result of increased fuel costs or restrictions on transportation.\nCyber Security Issues\nWe could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to cyber security issues.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed from cyber security risk and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers' or our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe collect and store information relating to our Club Riviera player\u2019s information in a proprietary database program which we use for sending special offerings to Club Riviera members based on a variety of criteria. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations, and compliance with regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our Club Riviera player\u2019s. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third-party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers, business partners, or employee information may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. As a result, our customers' information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our customers' consent.\nIn addition, we and our third-party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our business-to-business customers, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, customer, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers' or business partners' information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nDividends, Trading Market and Ownership Dilution\nWe have never paid regular dividends, do not intend to pay regular dividends in the foreseeable future and cannot pay regular dividends to any unsuitable person.\nWe have never paid regular dividends on our stock, nor do we anticipate paying regular dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain our cash flow or earnings, if any, to use in our ongoing operations. Also, due to gaming law considerations, our Articles of Incorporation prohibit the payment of regular dividends to anyone who is deemed an \u201cunsuitable person\u201d or is an\naffiliate of an \u201cunsuitable person.\u201d We may not pay regular dividends, except to defray tax liabilities, to any stockholder who has not been licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Commission without the Nevada Commission's approval.\nThere is currently no trading market for our capital stock and no trading market may develop.\nThere is currently no public market for our capital stock. Further, applicable gaming law requirements severely restrict the ability of our stockholders to transfer their capital stock. If an active trading market does not develop, owners of our capital stock may have difficulty selling any of our common stock.\nOwnership could be diluted by future issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities.\nOwnership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock or the exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants or convertible notes to purchase capital stock. In particular, we may sell securities in the future in order to finance operations, expansions, or particular projects or expenditures.\nPossible Application For Suitability\nCertain owners of our stock may have to file an application with, and be investigated by, the Nevada gaming authorities. If that owner is deemed \u201cunsuitable\u201d, that owner could lose most of the attributes of being a stockholder and it could have a detrimental effect on us.\nAs defined in Nevada gaming regulations, any person who acquires more than 5% of a Registered Corporation\u2019s voting securities must report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission. Nevada gaming regulations also require that beneficial owners of more than 10% of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. However, an \u201cinstitutional investor\u201d, as defined in the Nevada gaming regulations, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 11%, of our voting securities as a result of a stock repurchase by us may not be required to file such an application. Further, an institutional investor that acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of our voting securities may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds our voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25%, but not more than 29%, of our voting securities and maintain its waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by us. However, any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required, at the discretion of the Nevada Commission, to apply for a finding of suitability. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and the applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada gaming authorities in conducting the investigation.\nAny such person who fails to apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission may be found to be unsuitable. Any person who is found by the Nevada Commission to be unsuitable to be a beneficial owner of our voting securities but continues such beneficial ownership beyond the period of time prescribed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a beneficial owner of our voting securities or to have any other relationship with us, we:\n\u2022\npay that person any dividend or interest on our voting securities;\n\u2022\nallow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through our voting securities held by that person;\n\u2022\npay that person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise; or\n\u2022\nfail to pursue all lawful efforts to require that person to relinquish our voting securities for cash at fair market value.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K , we make \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d, as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

We do not plan to update forward-looking statements even though our situation or plans may change in the future, unless applicable law requires us to do so. Specific factors that might cause our actual results to differ from our plans, objectives or expectations, might cause us to modify our plans or objectives, or might affect our ability to meet our expectations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncessation of operations and eventual liquidation;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nour substantial losses since the Substantial Consummation Date;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve projected financial results;\n\u2022\nnegative effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our image;\n\u2022\ncompetition in the gaming industry, including the availability and success of alternative gaming venues, and other entertainment attractions;\n\u2022\nrisks related to geographic market concentration;\n\u2022\nloss of management and key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges or developments in laws, regulations or taxes in the gaming industry, for example, an increase in the Nevada gaming tax;\n\u2022\nrisks related to environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing energy prices;\n\u2022\nadverse effects of factors that are beyond our control;\n\u2022\nuninsured losses or losses that are not adequately covered by insurance;\n\u2022\ncosts and liabilities associated with litigation;\n\u2022\nthe consequences of concerns associated with wars, terrorism and homeland security;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes and work stoppages;\n\u2022\nvolatility in our hold percentage;\n\u2022\nthe loss of technological services and electrical power;\n\u2022\nthe loss in value of the Riviera brand;\n\u2022\nour inability to protect our brands;\n\u2022\nadverse effects from climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with legal claims and litigation related to the alleged effect of our operations on climate change; and\n\u2022\nadverse consequences from data breaches and other cyber security related risks.\nAll future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. In light of these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur.", "PERMNO": 83458, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "RVHLQ"}
