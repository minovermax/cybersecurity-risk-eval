RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could cause our financial condition or operating results in the future to differ significantly from our expected financial condition or operating results that are set forth in the forward looking statements contained in this Report. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur business, earnings and profitability are affected by the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States generally and, more specifically, in Southern California where a substantial portion of our business is generated, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and the sustainability of economic growth both in the United States and globally. The deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers, the demand for credit and other banking products, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal on outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, which could lead to decreased loan utilization rates, increased delinquencies and defaults and changes to our customers\u2019 ability to meet certain credit obligations. If any of these events occur, we could experience one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:\n\u2022\na decline in the demand for loans, which would cause a decline in interest income and our net interest margin;\n\u2022\na decline in the value of our loans or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate;\n\u2022\na decrease in deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers, which would adversely impact our liquidity position;\n\u2022\nan impairment of our investment securities and OREO; and\n\u2022\nan increase in the volume of loans that become delinquent or the number of borrowers that file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their home loans or commercial loan obligations to us, either of which could result in a higher level of non-performing assets and cause us to increase our ALLL, thereby reducing our earnings.\nIn addition, because the substantial majority of our customers and the assets securing a large proportion of our loans are located in Southern California, any regional or local economic downturn that affects Southern California, including the financial condition of our existing or prospective borrowers or property values in Southern California, may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically focused.\nWe could incur losses on the loans we make.\nLoan defaults and the incurrence of losses on the loans we make are an inherent risk of the banking business. That risk previously had been exacerbated by the significant slowdown in the housing markets and significant increases in real estate loan foreclosures in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties of California where most of our customers are based. This slowdown was attributable to declining real estate prices, excess inventories of unsold homes, high vacancy rates at commercial properties and increases in unemployment and a resulting loss of confidence about the future among businesses and consumers that had combined to adversely affect business and consumer spending. These conditions led to increases in our non-performing assets in prior periods, which required us to record loan charge-offs and write-downs in the carrying values of real properties that we acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure and caused us to incur losses in those periods. While we have begun to see a recovery in the housing markets including increased real estate prices, lower vacancy rates at commercial properties and continued improvement in unemployment, further weakness in economic conditions could result in additional loan charge-offs and asset write-downs that\nwould require us to increase the provisions we make for loan losses and losses on real estate owned that would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition and capital.\nWe may be required to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses (\u201cALLL\u201d) which would adversely affect our financial performance in the future.\nOn a quarterly basis we evaluate and conduct an analysis to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio. However, this evaluation requires us to make a number of estimates and judgments regarding the financial condition of a significant number of our borrowers, the fair value of the properties collateralizing our outstanding loans and economic trends that could affect the ability of borrowers to meet their payment obligations to us. Based on those estimates and judgments, we make determinations, which are necessarily subjective, with respect to (i) the adequacy of our ALLL to provide for write-downs in the carrying values and charge-offs of loans that may be required in the future and (ii) the need to increase the ALLL by means of a charge to income (commonly referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses). If, due to circumstances outside of our control, those estimates or judgments prove to have been incorrect or the Bank\u2019s regulators come to a different conclusion regarding the adequacy of the Bank\u2019s ALLL, we would have to increase the provisions we make for loan losses, which would reduce our income or could cause us to incur operating losses in the future.\nLiquidity risk could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and hurt our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, as we use cash to fund loans and investments and other interest-earning assets and deposit withdrawals that occur in the ordinary course of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity include deposits, FHLB borrowings, sales of loans or investment securities held for sale, repayments to the Bank of loans it makes to borrowers and sales of equity securities by us. If our ability to obtain funds from these sources becomes limited or the costs to us of those funds increases, whether due to factors that affect us specifically, including our financial performance or the imposition of regulatory restrictions on us, or due to factors that affect the financial services industry in general, including weakening economic conditions or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, then, our ability to grow our banking business would be adversely affected and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other banks and financial institutions that could hurt our business.\nWe conduct our business operations in Southern California, where the banking business is highly competitive and is dominated by large multi-state and in-state banks with operations and offices covering wide geographic areas. We also compete with other financial service businesses, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive banking and financial products and services as well as products and services that we do not offer. The larger banks and many of those other financial institutions have greater financial and other resources that enable them to conduct extensive advertising campaigns and to shift resources to regions or activities of greater potential profitability. They also have substantially more capital and higher lending limits than we do, which enable them to attract larger customers and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits. Increased competition may prevent us (i) from achieving increases, or could even result in decreases, in our loan volume or deposit balances, or (ii) from increasing interest rates on the loans we make or reducing the interest rates we pay to attract or retain deposits, either or both of which could cause a decline in our interest income or an increase in our interest expense and, therefore, lead to reductions in our net interest income and earnings.\nA higher risk of natural disasters in Southern California could disproportionately harm our business.\nHistorically, California, in which a substantial portion of our business is located, has been susceptible to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and wild fires and is currently in the midst of an ongoing drought. The nature and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. In the event of a major natural disaster, many of our borrowers may suffer uninsured property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs, which may negatively impact the ability of these borrowers to repay their loans or negatively impact the values of collateral securing our loans, either of which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. Additionally, the occurrence of natural disasters could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our business flow, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nA substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest we earn on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest we pay on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Due to the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid\non interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, in turn, our profitability. In addition, as a general rule, loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates. Rising interest rates, generally, are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may increase. Also, in a rising interest rate environment, we may need to accelerate the pace of rate increases on our deposit accounts as compared to the pace of increases in short-term market rates. Accordingly, changes in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality and loan origination volume.\nFor the past several years, the banking industry has operated in an extremely low interest rate environment relative to historical averages, and the Federal Reserve has pursued highly accommodative monetary policies (including a very low Federal funds rate and substantial purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury and agency securities) in an effor to facilitate growth in the U.S. economy and a reduction in levels of unemployment. This environment has placed downward pressure on the net interest margin of U.S. banks, including the Company. Despite the fact that interest rates are relatively low, loan demand has been relatively weak due largely to the financial difficulties encountered by prospective borrowers as a result of the economic recession and the weakness of the hoped for economic recovery, the unwillingness of businesses and consumers to borrow due to uncertainties and a lack of confidence about future economic conditions and a tightening of loan underwriting standards by us, as well as other banks and lending institutions, in response to these conditions. As a result, it has become more difficult to predict the impact that changes in interest rates will have on interest rate spreads and on the future financial performance of banks, including our Bank, which has added to the volatility of and adversely affected the stock prices of many banking institutions, including our own. It is not possible to predict how long these conditions will continue to affect us.\nWe also have adopted an interest rate risk management strategy for the purpose of protecting us against interest rate changes after approval and prior to the funding of mortgage loans and their subsequent sale in the secondary market. Developing an effective interest rate risk management strategy, however, is complex and no risk management strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate changes.\nGovernment regulations may impair our operations, restrict our growth or increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state bank regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFRB\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco under the delegated authority from the FRB, and the California Department of Business Oversight. The primary objective of these agencies is to protect bank depositors and other customers and consumers and not shareholders, whose respective interests often differ. Congress and these federal agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. The regulatory agencies have the legal authority to impose restrictions which they believe are needed to protect depositors and customers of banking institutions, even if those restrictions would adversely affect the ability of the banking institution to expand its business or pay cash dividends, or result in increases in its costs of doing business or hinder its ability to compete with less regulated financial services companies. Additionally, due to the complex and technical nature of many of the government regulations to which banking organizations are subject, inadvertent violations of those regulations may and sometimes do occur. In such an event, we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of such violations. If more serious violations were to occur, the regulatory agencies could limit our activities or growth or fine us, or ultimately put us out of business in the event we were to encounter severe liquidity problems or a significant erosion of our capital below the minimum amounts required under applicable bank regulatory guidelines.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act poses uncertainties for our business and has increased, and is likely to continue to increase, our costs of doing business.\nOn July 21, 2010, the President signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were made effective immediately. However, much of the Dodd-Frank Act is subject to further rulemaking and/or studies. As a result, the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act poses uncertainties for our business and has increased, and is likely to continue to increase, our costs of doing business. However, due to uncertainties concerning the timing and extent of future rulemaking, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations, will further impact our business and financial performance. Compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, Dodd-Frank permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal law. We cannot predict whether California state agencies will adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level or, if any are adopted, what impact they may have on us, our business or our results of operations.\nPremiums for federal deposit insurance have increased and may increase even more.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a specific level. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits and the FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It has, in addition, established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute, although there is no implementation deadline for the 2% ratio. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to keep the DIF at the statutory target level. The Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums increased substantially beginning in 2009, and we continue to expect to pay high premiums in the future. Any increase in our FDIC premiums could have a materially adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel could hurt our financial performance.\nOur success depends to a great extent on the continued availability of our existing management and, in particular, on Steven K. Buster our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Vertin our Commercial Banking Division President. In addition to their skills and experience as bankers, our executive officers provide us with extensive community ties upon which our competitive strategy is partially based. As a result, the loss of the services of any of these officers could harm our ability to implement our business strategy or our future operating results.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems.\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our online banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption, or breaches in security, of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan origination systems and, therefore, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, interruptions in service and security breaches could lead existing customers to terminate their banking relationships with us and could make it more difficult for us to attract new banking customers.\nA breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure to us.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists or other external parties. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. For example, other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems and those of our customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to real properties which we may acquire.\nIf borrowers are unable to meet their loan repayment obligations, we will initiate foreclosure proceedings with respect to and take title to the real properties that collateralized their loans. As an owner of such properties, we could become subject to environmental liabilities and incur substantial costs for any property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up that may be required due to any environmental contamination that may be found to exist at any of those properties, even though we did not engage in the activities that led to such contamination. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties seeking damages for environmental contamination emanating from the site. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities or costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to promote\nethical conduct and protect our reputation. However, these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline, which may make it more difficult to realize a profit on your investment in our shares of common stock.\nThe trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Our stock price in the future could be adversely affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions, described below, on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional regulatory restrictions on our business and operations or an inability to meet regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully implement our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock prices and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry stocks;\n\u2022\nproposed or newly adopted legislative or regulatory changes or developments aimed at the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nany future proceedings or litigation that may involve or affect us; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing concerns and a lack of confidence among investors that economic and market conditions will improve.\nOur principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our voting shares and are able to exercise significant influence over our business and have the power to block transactions that could benefit our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Carpenter Community Bancfund, L.P. and Carpenter Community Bancfund-A, L.P. (collectively, the \u201cCarpenter Funds\u201d) own a total of approximately 34% of our outstanding shares of voting stock and together constitute our largest shareholder. Further, pursuant to an investor rights agreement entered into with the Carpenter Funds, three individuals designated by the Carpenter Funds have been appointed to serve on the respective Boards of Directors of both the Company and the Bank. As a result, the Carpenter Funds have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring approval of our Board of Directors and matters requiring the approval of our shareholders. Consequently, the Carpenter Funds have significant influence over our operations and outcome of shareholder votes on the approval of mergers and acquisitions or changes in corporate control which, among other things, could (i) discourage potential acquirers from attempting to acquire the Company, thereby impeding or preventing the consummation of acquisition or change of control transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and (ii) make it more difficult for us to sell additional shares at prices in excess of those paid by the Carpenter Funds for their shares of common stock, even if our financial performance significantly improves.\nIf we sell additional shares of our common stock in the future, our shareholders could suffer significant dilution in their share ownership and voting power.\nSubject to market conditions and other factors, we may determine from time to time to issue additional shares of our common stock or pursue other equity financings to meet capital requirements or support the growth of our business. We have issued, and may continue to issue, stock options, warrants, or other stock grants under our equity incentive plan. It is probable that options and/or warrants will be exercised during their respective terms if the stock price exceeds the exercise price of the particular option or warrant. If the options or warrants are exercised, share ownership will be diluted.\nShare ownership of our common stock will also be diluted from shares issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. Additionally, holders of our Series B Convertible 8.4% Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Shares\u201d) are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash at a rate of 8.4% per annum if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors. However, the terms of the Series B Shares provide that if, due to legal or regulatory restrictions, we are unable to pay cash dividends on the Series B Shares for two semi-annual dividend periods, we will be required to pay such dividends in shares of our Series C 8.4% Noncumulative Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Shares\u201d). Due to dividend restrictions under California law and the FRBSF Agreement, we were precluded from paying cash dividends on the Series B Shares during each of the six month periods ended June 30, 2013, December 31, 2013, June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014. As a result, we issued a total of 11,123 Series C Shares as dividends on our outstanding Series B Shares in 2014. While the FRBSF Agreement has terminated, we expect that restrictions under California law applicable to the Bank will continue to restrict our ability to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Due to these dividend restrictions, we expect that it will be necessary for us to continue issuing Series C Shares in lieu of cash dividends on the Series B Shares. See \u201cDividend Policy and Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends\u201d in Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFurther issuance of any of shares of our common stock and/or preferred stock, including issuances upon conversion or as dividends on our outstanding preferred stock, would dilute the ownership interests of any holders of our common stock at the time of such issuance.\nOur articles of incorporation permit our Board of Directors to authorize and sell additional shares of preferred stock on terms that could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer that may be beneficial to our shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors has the power, under our articles of incorporation, to create and authorize the sale of one or more new series of preferred stock without having to obtain shareholder approval for such action. As a result, the Board could authorize the issuance of and issue shares of a new series of preferred stock to implement a shareholders rights plan (often referred to as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d) or could sell and issue preferred shares with special voting rights or conversion rights that could deter or delay attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, and attempts of third parties to engage in proxy contests and effectuate changes in control of us.", "PERMNO": 88368, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PMBC"}
