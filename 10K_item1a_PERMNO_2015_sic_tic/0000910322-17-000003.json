{"cik": "910322", "company": "ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following is a summary of risk factors relevant to our operations which should be carefully reviewed. These risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance.\nAstoria Financial Corporation was subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger was pending.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, we were unable to significantly advance our existing strategic initiatives to the extent previously anticipated due in part to the focus of management on the proposed Merger. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricted Astoria from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of NYCB, further restricting our opportunities. Employee retention was challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as employees experienced uncertainty about their future roles. Although we retained the majority of our key personnel, we experienced an 11% decline in workforce during 2016. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger also impaired our ability to attract replacement personnel during this period. We believe this uncertainty inhibited our ability to compete for new customers and additional business from existing customers, the impacts of which could carry forward into 2017.\nWe may not be able to fully execute on our strategic initiatives which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The termination of the Merger Agreement has resulted in the reevaluation of our strategic plan.\nWe have historically been a community-oriented retail bank offering traditional deposit products and focusing on residential mortgage lending. However, the economic environment over the past several years has made it difficult for us to profitably grow our business in the same manner as it has in the past. Accordingly, we continue to implement strategies to grow other loan categories to diversify earning assets and to increase low cost core deposits. These strategies include continued reliance on our multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage lending operations and expanding our business banking operations. Our business banking initiative includes focusing on small and middle market businesses, with an emphasis on attracting clients from larger competitors. There are costs, risks and uncertainties associated with the development, implementation and execution of these initiatives, including the investment of time and resources, the possibility that these initiatives will be unprofitable and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these initiatives.\nIn view of the termination of the Merger, we are reviewing our strategic plan, taking into account anticipated potential changes in interest rates, business activity, financial services legislation and regulation and overall regulatory climate. This review may result in changes to our strategic objectives, product offerings, balance sheet size and composition, staffing and operations. Our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan and to execute on new initiatives will\ndepend in part on our ability to attract and retain talented individuals to help manage any new initiatives and the existence of satisfactory market conditions that will allow us to profitably grow our businesses. Our potential inability to successfully execute new initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our net income.\nOur earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on our interest-earning assets, primarily our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, and the cost of our deposits and borrowings. This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence market interest rates, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the level of non-performing assets. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect customer demand for our products and services. We are subject to IRR to the degree that our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest-earning assets.\nIn addition, the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and market interest rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition.\nAt December 31, 2016, $1.95 billion of our borrowings contain features that would allow them to be called within one year and on a quarterly basis thereafter, of which $1.00 billion of our borrowings contain features that would allow them to be called during the 2017 first quarter. We expect that such call features are more likely to be exercised during periods of rising interest rates. If this were to occur, we would need to either renew the borrowings at a potentially higher rate of interest, which would negatively impact our net interest income, or repay such borrowings. If we sell securities or other assets to fund the repayment of such borrowings, any decline in estimated market value with respect to the securities or assets sold would be realized and could result in a loss upon such sale.\nInterest rates do and will continue to fluctuate. Although we cannot predict future Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, or FRB actions or other factors that will cause rates to change, the FOMC reaffirmed its view that an accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate. Despite the December 2015 and December 2016 actions by the FRB to raise short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in each instance, interest rates remain near historical lows and mortgage loan prepayments remain elevated. If long-term interest rates remain low, a flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve may continue and adversely impact our net interest rate spread and net interest margin. No assurance can be given that changes in interest rates or mortgage loan prepayments will not have a negative impact on our net interest income, net interest rate spread or net interest margin.\nOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area and nationally.\nOur retail banking and a significant portion of our lending business (approximately 48% of our residential mortgage loan portfolio and substantially all of our multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2016) are concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results of operations largely depend upon economic conditions in this area, although they also depend on economic conditions in other areas.\nWhile housing and real estate market values have improved from the significant declines experienced from 2007 to 2014, we are still operating in a challenging economic environment, both nationally and locally. Unemployment levels have improved to 4.7% and the number of people re-entering the job market has increased. At December 31, 2016, the average loan-to-value ratio of our mortgage loan portfolio was less than 51% based on current principal balances and original appraised values. However, no assurance can be given that the original appraised values are reflective of current market conditions. Real estate values and home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of\nthe economic environment could have an adverse effect on our borrowers, which could adversely affect our results of operations, as well as adversely affect our financial condition.\nStrong competition within our industry and market areas could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nOur profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas. The New York metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions, a number of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our competition for loans, both locally and nationally, comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies and credit unions.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our multi-family and commercial real estate lending and business banking operations. These business lines are also being aggressively pursued by a number of competitors, both large and small. Our most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. We also face competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds as well as from other financial intermediaries such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Price competition for loans and deposits could result in earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow our loan and deposit balances.\nIn December 2016, the OCC announced that it would begin considering applications from financial technology companies to become special purpose national banks, and requested comments about how it can foster responsible innovation in the chartering process while continuing to provide robust oversight. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nMulti-family and commercial real estate lending may expose us to increased lending risks.\nOur policy generally has been to originate multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans in the New York metropolitan area. At December 31, 2016, multi-family mortgage loans totaled $4.05 billion, or 39% of our total loan portfolio, and commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled $729.3 million, or 7% of our total loan portfolio. Our combined multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolio decreased $67.7 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family properties and commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Commercial real estate prices, according to many U.S. commercial real estate indices, are currently above the 2007 peak levels that contributed to the financial crisis. Accordingly, the Agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Our failure to adequately implement enhanced risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses, from this portfolio. At December 31, 2016, non-performing multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans totaled $9.7 million, or 0.20% of our total portfolio of multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans.\nLoans in our residential mortgage loan portfolio which have recently shifted from interest-only to amortizing may expose us to increased risk of borrower delinquencies.\nAt December 31, 2016, our interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled $330.5 million, of which $278.9 million is scheduled to commence principal amortization during 2017. In addition, at December 31, 2016, $1.41 billion of residential mortgage loans originated in prior years as interest-only loans were included in our portfolio of amortizing residential mortgage loans. Such loans consist of $870.3 million of loans which converted pursuant to their contractual terms and $542.8 million of loans which were refinanced at an earlier stage through a program under which certain re-underwriting procedures were completed. After a refinance or conversion to an amortizing loan, a borrower\u2019s monthly payment may increase by a substantial amount and the borrower may not be able to afford the increased monthly payment, which could result in increased delinquencies and, accordingly, adversely affect our results of operations. Of total loans which had previously been interest-only, $84.1 million were non-performing at December 31, 2016, the majority of which converted pursuant to their contractual terms.\nThe FASB\u2019s recently adopted ASU 2016-13 will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new CECL standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAstoria Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or lend funds to us is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent we need but are not able to access such funds, may prevent us from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments due on our debt obligations.\nWe are a unitary savings and loan holding company currently regulated by the FRB and almost all of our operating assets are owned by Astoria Bank. We rely primarily on dividends from Astoria Bank to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations. The OCC regulates all capital distributions by Astoria Bank directly or indirectly to us, including dividend payments. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Astoria Bank must file a notice with the OCC at least 30 days prior to each capital distribution. If Astoria Bank does not qualify for expedited treatment under the OCC rules and regulations or if the total amount of all capital distributions (including each proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years, then Astoria Bank must file an application to receive the approval of the OCC for a proposed capital distribution. During 2016, Astoria Bank was required to file such applications, but did not make a request to the OCC for capital\ndistributions. Effective 2017, Astoria Bank is not required to file such applications, but is required to notify the OCC of its intent to pay future dividends. Astoria Bank must also provide notice to the FRB at least 30 days prior to declaring a dividend.\nIn addition, Astoria Bank may not pay dividends to us if, after paying those dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the OCC notified Astoria Bank that it was in need of more than normal supervision. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution such as Astoria Bank is prohibited from making a capital distribution, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become \u201cundercapitalized\u201d (as such term is used in the FDIA). Payment of dividends by Astoria Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the OCC if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Furthermore, capital standards imposed on us and similarly situated institutions have been and continue to be refined by bank regulatory agencies under the Reform Act. Deterioration of economic conditions and further changes to regulatory guidance could result in revised capital standards that may indicate the need for us or Astoria Bank to maintain greater capital positions, which could lead to limitations in dividend payments to us by Astoria Bank.\nThere can be no assurance that Astoria Bank will be able to pay dividends at past levels, or at all, in the future. If we do not receive sufficient cash dividends or are unable to borrow from Astoria Bank, then we may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends to our shareholders, repurchase our common stock or service our debt obligations.\nIn addition to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, Astoria Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit it makes to its affiliates and on investments in stock or other securities of its affiliates. We are considered an affiliate of Astoria Bank. These restrictions prevent affiliates of Astoria Bank, including us, from borrowing from Astoria Bank, unless various types of collateral secure the loans. Federal law limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in any single affiliate to 10% of Astoria Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus and also limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in all affiliates to 20% of Astoria Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus.\nThe Reform Act imposes further restrictions on transactions with affiliates and extensions of credit to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders, by, among other things, expanding covered transactions to include securities lending, repurchase agreement and derivatives activities with affiliates.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements and limitations that may impact our ability to pay future dividends.\nWe are currently subject to the supervisory guidance issued by the FRB regarding the payment of dividends, which states that we should either eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (1) our net income available to common shareholders over the past year is insufficient to fully fund a dividend, (2) our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with our capital needs and our overall current or prospective financial condition or (3) we will not meet, or are in danger of not meeting, our minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and our depositors, as well as other consumers, and not to benefit our stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations, or the failure to develop, implement and comply with corrective action plans to address any identified areas of noncompliance, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the commencement of informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against us. Other negative consequences also can result from such failures, including regulatory restrictions\non our activities, reputational damage, restrictions on the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities and increases in our costs of doing business. Increases in our costs of doing business may include increased salaries and benefits expenses associated with hiring additional employees, incurring fees and expenses for outside services, such as consulting and legal advice, and costs associated with enhancing or acquiring systems and technological infrastructure to strengthen our regulatory compliance program. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in laws, government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory changes and may be the subject of further significant legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, those with respect to federal, state and local taxation, may increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the costs and burden of compliance have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for Astoria Bank, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on Astoria Bank or our borrowers, and therefore on our results of operations.\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new President of the United States and the first year since 2010 in which both Houses of Congress have majority representation from the same political party as the President. In recent years, however, both the new President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, including amendments to the Reform Act and structural changes to Agencies and the CFPB. On January 20, 2017, President Trump\u2019s Chief of Staff issued a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies directing them, with certain exceptions, to effectively freeze the administrative rule-making process until a department or agency head appointed or designated by President Trump reviews and approves the regulation. The memorandum, however, is unclear as to its applicability to the Agencies and the CFPB. On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the administration\u2019s policy to regulate the U.S. financial system according to a set of principles. The executive order also requires the Treasury Secretary to report to the President, within 120 days of the date of the executive order, on the extent to which any existing laws, treaties, regulations, guidance, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements promote or inhibit the principles described in the executive order. The new Administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. New appointments to the FRB could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could materially affect us and the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nNew and future rulemaking from the CFPB may have a material effect on our operations and operating costs.\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations and, with respect to institutions of our size, has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations and is authorized, individually or jointly with the Agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and DOJ, the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations, and have done so on a number of occasions.\nAs an independent bureau within the FRB, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has initiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the CFPB. These enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the CFPB interprets and enforces consumer protection laws with respect to all supervised institutions, which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws.\nIn May 2016, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would prohibit banking organizations from using a pre-dispute arbitration agreement to block consumer class actions in court and would require banking organizations to insert language into their arbitration agreements reflecting this limitation. The proposed rule would also require banking organizations that use pre-dispute arbitration agreements to submit certain records relating to arbitral proceedings to the CFPB. The proposed rule would generally apply to contracts entered into more than 180 days after the effective date of any final rule. If adopted as proposed, this rule could result in increased litigation and defense costs as plaintiff\u2019s class action firms would feel encouraged to seek clients as class representatives for alleged consumer harm that otherwise would have been the subject to the existing arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. This proposed rule, if adopted, and other CFPB regulations likely will continue to increase our compliance expenses.\nAs a result of the Reform Act and related rulemaking, we have become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nPursuant to the Reform Act, the Agencies adopted the Final Capital Rules in July 2013 to update the Agencies\u2019 general risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements to incorporate agreements reflected in the Basel III capital standards as well as the requirements of the Reform Act. Among other things, the Final Capital Rules established a new minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% and increased the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%. In addition, the Final Capital Rules added a requirement to maintain a minimum Conservation Buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets and provided that the failure to maintain the minimum Conservation Buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. The Final Capital Rules also subjected many savings and loan holding companies, such as Astoria Financial Corporation, to consolidated capital requirements. The Final Capital Rules are described in more detail in Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision - Capital Requirements.\u201d The new minimum regulatory capital ratios under the Final Capital Rules became effective for Astoria Bank and Astoria Financial Corporation on January 1, 2015. The failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the FRB placing limitations or conditions on our activities or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends; issuing a directive to increase our capital; and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance.\nOur ability to originate residential mortgage loans for portfolio has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the unprecedented involvement of the U.S. government and GSEs in the residential mortgage market.\nOver the past several years, we have faced increased competition for residential mortgage loans due to the unprecedented involvement of the GSEs in the mortgage market as a result of the economic crisis, which has caused the interest rate for 30 year fixed rate mortgage loans that conform to GSE guidelines to remain artificially low. In addition, the U.S. Congress has expanded the conforming loan limits in many of our operating markets, allowing larger balance loans to continue to be acquired by the GSEs. As a result, more loans in our portfolio qualified under the expanded conforming loan limits and were refinanced into conforming fixed rate mortgages which we originate but do not retain for portfolio. Our residential mortgage loan repayments have remained at elevated levels and outpaced our loan production as a result of these factors, making it difficult for us to grow our residential mortgage loan portfolio and balance sheet.\nThe ultimate resolution of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may materially impact our results of operations.\nBoth Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under conservatorship with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or the FHFA. In February 2012, the FHFA delivered a strategic plan to U.S. Congress to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nover the next several years. This plan included building a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market, continuing to shrink Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s operations by reducing direct funding of mortgages, and maintaining foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability for new and refinanced mortgages. In addition, in August 2012, the FHFA and the U.S. Treasury announced further steps to expedite the winding down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by accelerating the rate at which Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s investment portfolios will be reduced. Pursuant to these steps, Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s investment portfolios must be reduced to the agreed target four years earlier than previously scheduled. In May 2014, the FHFA set forth a new strategic plan which included maintaining and improving Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability, reducing taxpayer risk through increasing the role of private capital in the mortgage market and building a new single-family securitization infrastructure for use by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and adaptable for use by other participants in the secondary market. We cannot be certain if or when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be wound down, if or when reform of the housing finance market will be implemented or what the future role of the U.S. government will be in the mortgage market, and, accordingly, we will not be able to determine the impact that any such reform may have on us until a definitive reform plan is adopted.\nChanges in the fair value of our securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2016, $280.0 million of our securities were classified as available-for-sale. The estimated fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate securities portfolio will decrease. Our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate securities. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax effect, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities.\nWe conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors which we consider in our analysis include, but are not limited to, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, our intent and ability to not sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near-term fair value recovery. We generally view changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with our experience. If we deem such decline to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non-interest income, except for the amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a debt security that does not represent credit losses which is recognized in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes.\nWe have, in the past, recorded OTTI charges. We continue to monitor the fair value of our securities portfolio as part of our ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges related to securities in the future.\nDeclines in the market value of our common stock may have a material effect on the value of our reporting unit which could result in a goodwill impairment charge and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2016, the carrying amount of our goodwill totaled $185.2 million. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016 and determined there was no goodwill impairment as of our annual impairment test date. We would test our goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. No events have occurred and no circumstances have changed since our annual impairment test date that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our market capitalization is less than our total\nstockholders\u2019 equity at December 31, 2016. We considered this and other factors in our goodwill impairment analyses. No assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in a subsequent period. However, our tangible capital ratio and Astoria Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential non-cash expense.\nA natural disaster could harm our business.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of a natural disaster could result in one or more of the following: (1) an increase in delinquent loans; (2) an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; (3) a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or (4) a decrease in the value of the collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers' borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nThe occurrence of any failure, breach or interruption in service involving our systems or those of our service providers, including as a result of a cyber attack, could damage our reputation, cause losses, increase our expenses and result in a loss of customers, an increase in regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our stock.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits and our loans. In the normal course of our business, we collect, process, retain and transmit (by email and other electronic means) sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We also outsource certain aspects of our data processing to certain third-party providers. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, we, and in some cases a third party, compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our business, operations, plans and strategies.\nAs a result, our business and operations depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party service providers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security measures and business continuity programs, our facilities, computer systems, software and networks, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. In addition, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of our customers, clients or counterparties. While we regularly conduct security assessments on our third party service providers, there can be no assurance that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber attack or other security breach.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nWe use a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches and to protect confidential information from mishandling, misuse or loss, including\ndetection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be promptly detected and adequately addressed if they do, and early detection of security breaches may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. If there is a failure in or breach of our computer systems or networks, or those of a third-party service provider, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, such computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized, or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers, clients or counterparties.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny, cause us significant reputational damage or erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, cause us to lose customers or have greater difficulty in attracting new customers, have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock or subject us to financial losses that are either not insured or not fully covered by insurance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our cybersecurity procedures are increasingly subject to regulations administered and enforced by our regulators, which could result in elevated liability from these disruptions. Furthermore, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance or modify our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks.\nOur stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals.\nThe processes we use to estimate the effects of changing interest rates, real estate values and economic indicators such as unemployment on our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, even if our assumptions are accurate predictors of future performance, the models they are based on may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or implementation. If the models we use in the process of managing our interest rate and other risks prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, we could incur increased or unexpected losses which, in turn, could adversely affect our earnings and capital. Furthermore, the assumptions we utilize for our stress tests may not meet with regulatory approval, which could result in our stress testing receiving a failing grade. In addition to adversely affecting our reputation, failing our stress tests could preclude or delay our ability to grow through acquisition and could lead to a reduction in our quarterly cash dividends.\nMany aspects of our operations are dependent upon the soundness of other financial intermediaries.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, execution of transactions or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us.", "PERMNO": 79796, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "AF"}
