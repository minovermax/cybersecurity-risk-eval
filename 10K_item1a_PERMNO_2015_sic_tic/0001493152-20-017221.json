{"cik": "880432", "company": "MISONIX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could affect our ability to achieve results discussed in any forward-looking statement. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which is materially impacting the markets and communities in which we and our customers operate.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the recent global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted medical spending and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, we experienced a significant decline in revenue during March 2020. We expect the COVID-19 global pandemic to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business including our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; the negative affect it may have on global and regional economies and economic activity; changes in customers and consumer behavior, including cancellations of elective surgical procedures; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies recover after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we have experienced a disruption in our supply chain and a decrease in sales due to a decrease in elective surgical procedures. Our products are sensitive to reductions in deferrable and emergent medical procedures, and, as hospital systems prioritize treatment of COVID-19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines, certain medical procedures have been suspended or postponed in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which has caused a reduction in sales of these products.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused hospitals to restrict access to non-essential personnel, including family and friends of infected patients. As a result, our sales force is not able to access a significant portion of the market to generate new sales orders. COVID-19 could also adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations, including our executive officers and other members of our management team, as well as the ability of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to retain their key employees. To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by COVID-19 and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our operations and other important commercial functions.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, consumers, suppliers, business partners and local communities) to responsibly address this global pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the situation and assess possible implications to our business and our stakeholders and plan to take appropriate actions to mitigate adverse consequences. We cannot assure that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts. The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. Many regions, including those that had experienced declines in infection rates, are now seeing increased infections and deaths resulting from COVID-19. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or its overall impact on our business. Even after the COVID-19 global pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse effects on our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. The effects of COVID-19 has also affected financial markets and corporate credit markets, which could adversely affect our ability to access financing on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted our operations and if we are unable to re-commence normal operations in the near-term, we may be out of compliance with certain covenants in our debt facilities.\nUnder the terms of certain of our debt facilities with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $44 million of indebtedness as of June 30, 2020, we are required to comply with covenants, such as maintaining minimum revenue and EBITDA levels. As a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our business operations have been disrupted and if we are unable to re-commence normal operations in the near-term, we may be out of compliance with certain of those covenants.\n- 8 -\nThere can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers from the lenders under these facilities if we are unable to comply with covenants in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain a covenant waiver under any one or more of our debt facilities, we will be in default of such agreements, which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements. As a consequence, we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities. If we are unable to obtain a covenant waiver in the future under any one or more of these debt facilities, there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities.\nCovenant waivers may lead to fees associated with obtaining the waiver, increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable to us under these debt facilities, and such increased costs, restrictions and modifications may vary among debt facilities. Our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities will be limited by the restrictions in our indebtedness.\nWith respect to each of these debt facilities, if we cannot obtain a waiver or refinance or repay such debt facilities, we would be in default under such facilities, which could lead to an acceleration of the indebtedness under such debt facilities. In turn, this could lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt. As a result, the failure to obtain the covenant waivers described above would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a recent history of net losses.\nWe have experienced losses from continuing operations during the last four fiscal years. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately $22 million for the 2020 fiscal year, and the accumulated deficit was approximately $39.3 million as of June 30, 2020. Our losses from continuing operations were further adversely impacted due to the COVID global pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, we experienced a significant decline in revenue since March 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be able to return to operating profitability in the near-term or at all. As of June 30, 2020, we had a cash balance of approximately $38.0 million. Although we believe this amount is sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that this will provide sufficient liquidity for longer-term operations or initiatives. Our cash flows may be affected by a number of factors, including changing market conditions, market acceptance of our new and existing products, and the loss of one or more key customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital if the need arises. The failure to raise any necessary additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, may have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness that we incur. This cash may not be readily available to us.\nOur ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay any indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe are subject to extensive medical device regulation, that may impede or hinder the approval process for our products and, in some cases, may not ultimately result in approval or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products.\nOur medical devices, wound products, and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation, including by the FDA, the DOJ and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could negatively affect our business.\nThese regulations include regulations pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, by the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In addition, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u25cf take a significant amount of time;\n\u25cf require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u25cf involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing;\n\u25cf require changes to the products; and\n\u25cf result in limitations on the proposed uses of the products\n- 9 -\nMarketing approvals or clearances are not the only risk. The FDA, and other regulatory bodies, also can require the withdrawal of an approved or cleared product from commercial distribution due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, FDA regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a medical device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Union and China, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure to meet regulatory quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsequently, there can be no assurance that we will receive the required clearances from the FDA or other regulatory bodies for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any FDA approval will not be subsequently withdrawn. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or other regulatory bodies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical device industry.\nThe medical device and wound healing product markets are is highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies and other providers of human allografts and skin substitutes, most of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do.\nAdditionally, the medical device product market is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technology may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our revenues. In some cases, companies may attempt to copy our designs illegally. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled development personnel, obtain patent and other protection for our technology and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products. Failure to develop new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively.\nPatents, trademarks and other intangible proprietary rights are and will be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies. We will also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and overseas for patentable subject matter of our proprietary devices and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We also operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and it has been common for companies in the medical device field to challenge aggressively the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex, and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel.\nIn addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets, or know-how or to assert our intellectual property rights against claimed infringement by others. Any such legal action could be costly and time consuming to us. and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful.\nThe invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, or if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n- 10 -\neSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain applications and data utilizing on-site and off-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, fire, flood, other natural disasters, power loss, computer systems failure, data network failure, internet failure, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also interrupt our operations, including our ability to receive and ship orders from customers, bill our customers, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nFuture product liability claims, and other litigation may adversely affect our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe design, manufacture, and marketing of our medical device products and human skin allografts entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.\nAnyone or any company can bring an action against Misonix, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, and adverse litigation results could affect our business.\nOur judicial system allows anyone, including shareholders, to bring a claim against us and force us to defend our company, even if the claim is baseless. The defense may or may not be covered by our insurance, the result of which could ultimately create a burden on us dependent upon the outcome.\nLitigation can be lengthy, expensive, and disruptive to our operations, and results cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of various claims. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or injunctive relief. As an example, on March 23, 2017, our former distributor in China, Cicel (Beijing) Science & Technology Co., Ltd., filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that we improperly terminated our contract with the former distributor. We believe that we have various legal and factual defenses to the allegations in the complaint and intend to defend the action vigorously. Fact discovery in the case is ongoing, and there is no trial date currently set.\nViolation of anti-corruption laws could subject us to significant penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business and liquidity.\nWe are required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world where we do business. Compliance with these laws has been subject to increasing focus and activity by regulatory authorities in recent years.\nWith the assistance of outside counsel, beginning in 2016 we conducted a voluntary investigation into the business practices of the independent Chinese entity that previously distributed our products in China and our knowledge of those business practices, which may have had implications under the FCPA, as well as into various internal control issues identified during the investigation. We did not identify any information through the investigation or otherwise that suggests that our previously reported consolidated financial statements are incorrect. On September 27, 2016 and September 28, 2016, we voluntarily contacted the SEC and the DOJ, respectively, to advise both agencies of these potential issues. Thereafter, we provided documents and information to, and cooperated fully with, the SEC and the DOJ, in their investigations of these matters.\n- 11 -\nOn June 18, 2019, we received a letter from the Division of Enforcement of the SEC advising us that the SEC had concluded its investigation of us and that, based on the information it had as of the date of the letter, it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against us. On August 14, 2019, we received a declination letter from the United States Department of Justice DOJ stating that the DOJ has closed its inquiry into us without any action.\nFuture actions by our employees, or third-party intermediaries acting on our behalf, in violation of anticorruption laws, including the FCPA, whether carried out in the United States or elsewhere in connection with the conduct of our business may expose us to liability for violations and significant costs and expenses in investigating such actions or defending against civil or criminal charges associated therewith and accordingly may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and line extensions, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in a commercially viable product.\nIn order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and opportunities.\nAs a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market\u2019s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals from the FDA, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nNew products may not be accepted by customers in the marketplace.\nWe are now, and will continue to be, developing new products and introducing them into the market. There can be no assurance that any new product will be accepted by the market. New products are sometimes introduced into the market in a prototype format and may need later revisions or design changes before they operate in a manner to be accepted in the market. As a result of the introduction of new products, there is some risk that revenue expectations may not be met and in some cases the product may not achieve market acceptance.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or our exclusion as a supplier from certain of our significant market segments.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry, including hospitals. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our hospital customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may experience disruption in supply due to our dependence on our suppliers to continue to ship product requirements and our inability to obtain suppliers of certain components for our products.\nOur suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including poor business practices, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunctions, labor shortages, or environmental factors. In addition, we purchase both raw materials used in most products and finished goods from various suppliers and may have to rely on a single source supplier for certain components of our products where there are no alternatives are available, such as for our product TheraSkin. Although we anticipate that we have adequate sources of supply and/or inventory of these components to handle our production needs for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to secure on a timely basis sufficient quantities of the materials we depend on to manufacture our products, if we encounter delays or contractual or other difficulties in our relationships with these suppliers, or if we cannot find suppliers at an acceptable cost, then the manufacture of our products may be disrupted, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in fiscal 2020, we experienced certain supply chain disruptions due to suppliers not being able to keep pace with our demand for materials and product due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These disruptions caused us to not be able to ship certain customer orders on time, creating a sales backlog that was higher than normal.\n- 12 -\nIn addition, our suppliers, contract manufacturers and distributors, and other third parties we contract with are subject to ongoing, periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with applicable regulations and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not control compliance with these regulations and standards by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors and other third parties with which it contracts. They might not be able to comply with these regulatory requirements. If they fail to comply with applicable regulations, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could issue orders of suspension, recall, destruction or cessation of manufacturing, or impose sanctions on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, denial of any required marketing approval, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. For example, the FDA could stop or delay approval of production of products if LifeNet\u2019s manufacturing facilities do not comply with applicable manufacturing requirements. Any of these actions could significantly and adversely affect the supply and distribution of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage any expansion or acquisition, our business could be impaired.\nWe may in the future acquire one or more technologies, products or companies that complement our business. We may not be able to integrate these into our business effectively and any such acquisition could bring additional risks, exposures, and challenges to our business. In addition, acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses, subject us to liabilities, and increase our risk of litigation, all of which could harm our business. If we use cash to acquire technologies, products, or companies, such use may divert resources otherwise available for other purposes. If we use our common stock to acquire technologies, products, or companies, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. If we fail to manage any expansions or acquisition, our business could be impaired.\nWe completed our acquisition of Solsys Medical, LLC in September 2019, which resulted in a significant increase in our revenues, the addition of additional products and additions to our executive management team. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expanded business, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. If we are not able to continue the combination of Misonix and Solsys in an efficient and effective manner, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur agreements and contracts entered into with partners and other third parties may not be successful.\nWe signed in the past and may pursue in the future agreements and contracts with third parties to assist in our marketing, manufacturing, selling, and distribution efforts. These agreements are made on a case-by-case basis after analyzing potential impact and benefit to our business. While we have entered into such agreements and contracts in the past, and may pursue such agreements and contracts in the future, the performance of our partners and third parties cannot be guaranteed. We cannot assure that any agreements or contracts entered into will be successful.\nThe fluctuation of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenues and results of operations have in the past varied, and likely will in the future vary, from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. Reliance should not be made on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters, our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors focused on our performance. In this event, the price of our common stock may fall.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain additional key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, or we may lose existing key management, sales and marketing or technical personnel, which may delay our development and marketing efforts.\nWe depend on a number of key management, sales and marketing, and technical personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key employees could delay the achievement of our development and marketing objectives. Our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, sales and marketing and technical personnel to meet our growth goals. We face intense competition for qualified personnel, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers, and we do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain such personnel.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse or unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\n- 13 -\nRisk of reprocessing disposables.\nIn some jurisdictions around the world, culture and practice encourages reuse of disposable products when the product is clearly labeled for single use. Such reuse may expose us to liability in these jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 77282, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "MSON"}
