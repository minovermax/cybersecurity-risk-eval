{"cik": "1083446", "company": "Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations or financial condition. You should consider carefully the following factors, in addition to the other information concerning the Company and its business, before you decide to buy or hold shares of our common stock.\nRisk Relating to Our Business\nWe might need to raise additional capital, which might not be available.\nThe Company has historically incurred significant losses, and we may require additional equity or debt financing for additional working capital, to fund acquisitions, or to meet our liabilities, including our maturing short term obligations. In the event of additional financing being unavailable to us, we may be unable to operate or continue in existence, and the price of our common stock may decline and we may be or be made bankrupt.\nWe have a history of losses, and may have to further reduce our costs by curtailing future operations to continue as a business.\nHistorically we have had operating losses and our cash flow has been inadequate to support our ongoing operations. For the year ended March 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $1.3 million, and as of March 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $19.3 million. Our ability to fund our capital requirements out of our available cash and cash generated from our operations depends on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate recently acquired businesses and continue growing our existing operations. If we cannot continue to generate positive cash flow from operations, we will have to reduce our costs and try to raise working capital from other sources. These measures could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our operations and expand our business.\nThe terms of our debt agreements could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions and an event of default under our debt agreements could harm our business.\nOur existing secured debt agreements with NNA of Nevada, Inc. (\u201cNNA\u201d), an affiliate of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA (\u201cFresenius\u201d), contain, and any future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. Our existing debt agreements include covenants that generally:\n\u00b7 do not allow us to borrow additional amounts without the approval of NNA;\n\u00b7 require us to obtain the consent of NNA for acquisitions of $500,000 or more and grant security interests in newly-acquired companies;\n\u00b7 do not allow us to dispose of assets;\n\u00b7 do not allow us to liquidate, wind up or dissolve any of our subsidiaries without the approval of NNA;\n\u00b7 do not allow us to create any liens on any of our assets;\n\u00b7 do not allow us to pursue lines of business outside the lines of businesses engaged in by the Company as of March 28, 2014;\n\u00b7 require us to not impair NNA\u2019s security interests in our assets; and\n\u00b7 require us to meet, on an ongoing basis, certain financial targets as to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated tangible net worth. No assurances can be given that we will be able to meet any of the financial covenants in favor of NNA, and, if we fail to meet any financial covenant, there will be an event of default under the existing NNA agreements, and no assurance can be given that NNA will waive such default, which could result in material adverse effects on us.\nAs discussed below in the risk factor entitled \u201cLaws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties or require a corporate restructuring,\u201d we have certain contractual rights relating to the transfer of equity interests in some of our affiliated physician groups through Physician Shareholders agreements with Dr. Hosseinion, the controlling stockholder of our affiliated physician groups. Dr. Hosseinion\u2019s ceasing to serve as a senior executive under his employment agreement would be an event of default under the debt agreements with NNA, unless he died or became disabled or was replaced by a new senior executive reasonably satisfactory to NNA. In the event that an event of default has occurred under the terms of our debt agreements with NNA, NNA has the right to require us to exercise this equity transfer right in favor of a transferee approved by NNA. If NNA exercised this right, in addition to any other remedies NNA would be entitled to under our debt agreements, we may lose control of our affiliated physician groups which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNNA has a security interest over all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries and (with limited exceptions) affiliates, and NNA would be able to foreclose on our assets if we defaulted on our obligations under the NNA debt agreements.\nIf we defaulted on our obligations to NNA, they would be able to exercise various remedies, including foreclosing on and selling our assets and those of our subsidiaries, and using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding obligations to NNA.\nCertain of NNA\u2019s rights under the financing agreements would continue after we repay all our debt to NNA.\nAs discussed in \u201cOur Business - NNA Financing Arrangements,\u201d we have granted NNA various rights, including the right to nominate a director and appoint a board observer and to participate in certain equity offerings that will survive the repayment of our debt to NNA.\nNNA has consent rights over certain corporate decisions.\nAs discussed above regarding our debt arrangements with NNA and as further discussed in \u201cOur Business - NNA Financing Arrangements,\u201d we have needed and may in the future need NNA\u2019s consent for a number of different types of transactions. NNA could at any time withhold or condition its consent at its sole discretion. Consequently, we would be unable to take the action to which NNA did not consent or, if we did so without NNA\u2019s consent, we would be in default under the agreements with NNA and NNA would have the right to enforce various remedies, including requiring immediate repayment of any outstanding indebtedness under those agreements. NNA\u2019s enforcement of its remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on us and our business.\nWe have to make significant expenditures to service our existing debt, which may reduce our ability to continue expanding.\nWe have significant outstanding debt obligations, including the obligations with NNA described above and our 9% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes, which become due and payable on February 15, 2016 unless converted. As a result, we have to devote significant resources to servicing our existing debt load, and may be unable to devote sufficient resources to our ongoing growth and expansion. This may have a material adverse effect on us and our business.\nWe are required to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the sale of NNA\u2019s registrable securities by October 24, 2015.\nWe are required to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the sale of NNA\u2019s registrable securities by October 24, 2015. If we fail to do so, on October 24, 2015, and for each month thereafter until we file the registration statement registering NNA\u2019s registrable securities, we must pay NNA liquidated damages of 1.5% of the total purchase price of the registrable securities owned by NNA, payable in Common Stock. This may result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nWe are required to obtain NNA\u2019s consent to the preparation and filing of any registration statement.\nWe will have to obtain a consent from NNA before filing any registration statement, and there can be no assurance that NNA will provide a consent. If NNA does not provide a consent, or conditioned its consent on any new requirements, we may be unable to file a registration statement in the future, even if such filing is advantageous to our business.\nThe Company has a limited operating history that makes it difficult to reliably predict future growth and operating results.\nThe predecessor to ApolloMed was incorporated in California in 2001, and served initially as the management company for our affiliated medical group, ApolloMed Hospitalists. In addition, ApolloMed was awarded a participation agreement under CMS\u2019 MSSP in July 2012. ApolloMed has limited experience operating an ACO or managed care organization. Further, MMG is growing rapidly and has received a one-time true-up payment in the fourth quarter for services rendered throughout fiscal year 2015, that make it difficult to predict its future cash flow and results based on current results. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business prospects, which makes it difficult to forecast ApolloMed\u2019s future operating results and cash flows. The evolving nature of the current medical services industry increases these uncertainties. You must consider the Company\u2019s business prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and problems frequently encountered by companies with limited operating histories. Our ability to predict growth at any time in the future may be limited.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate recently acquired and launched entities and may have difficulty predicting the future needs of those entities.\nIn 2014, ApolloMed (including its affiliates that are wholly-owned by Dr. Hosseinion) acquired Southern California Heart Centers, AKM Medical Group, a Los Angeles based IPA, Best Choice Hospice Care LLC and Holistic Health Home Health Care Inc., and launched ApolloMed Care Clinic and ApolloMed Palliative Services, LLC. As a result of our rapid expansion we may be unable to successfully integrate the various entities we have acquired or formed. Further, these entities operate in different areas of the health care industry, and we cannot accurately predict how these acquired entities will perform in the future.\nThe growth strategy of the Company may not prove viable and expected growth and value may not be realized.\nOur business strategy is to rapidly grow by managing a network of medical groups providing certain hospital-based services and integrated inpatient and outpatient physician networks. We also seek growth opportunities through the acquisition of target medical groups and other service providers. Identifying quality acquisition candidates is a time-consuming and costly process. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and establishing relationships with these and other candidates. If the Company is successful in identifying and acquiring other entities, our ability to successfully implement our business plan and achieve targeted financial results is dependent on successfully integrating those entities. The process of integrating acquired entities involves risks. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 demands on our management team related to the significant increase in the size of our business;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices;\n\u00b7 difficulties in conforming the acquired entities\u2019 accounting policies to ours;\n\u00b7 retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of departments, information technology systems, including accounting;\n\u00b7 systems, technologies, books and records, procedures and maintaining uniform standards, such as internal accounting controls;\n\u00b7 procedures, and policies; and\n\u00b7 costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integration of our acquisitions or the growth of such acquisitions effectively.\nAn element of our growth strategy is also the expansion of our business by developing new palliative care programs in our existing markets and in new markets. This aspect of our growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our overall growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u00b7 identify markets that meet our selection criteria for new palliative care programs;\n\u00b7 hire and retain a qualified management team to operate each of our new palliative care programs;\n\u00b7 manage a large and geographically diverse group of palliative care programs;\n\u00b7 become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;\n\u00b7 generate a sufficient patient base in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets; or\n\u00b7 compete effectively with existing programs.\nWe may not make appropriate acquisitions, may fail to integrate them into our business, or these acquisitions could alter our current payor mix and reduce our income.\nOur business is significantly dependent on locating and acquiring or partnering with medical practices or individual physicians to provide health care services. As part of our growth strategy, we regularly review potential acquisition opportunities. We believe that there continue to be a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing such acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any such acquisitions would be. If we are not successful in finding attractive acquisition candidates that we can acquire on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot successfully complete and efficiently integrate those acquisitions that we identify, we may not be able to implement our business model, which would likely negatively impact our revenues and income. Furthermore, our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or strategic opportunities or successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any suitable opportunities. In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. This competition may intensify due to the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry, which may increase our acquisition costs.\n\u00b7 We may be unable to successfully and efficiently integrate completed acquisitions, including our recently completed acquisitions and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected. Integrating completed acquisitions into our existing operations involves numerous short-term and long-term risks, including diversion of our management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, failure to retain payor contracts and failure of the acquired practice to be financially successful.\n\u00b7 We cannot be certain of the extent of any unknown or contingent liabilities of any acquired business, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws. We may incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired entities. Also, depending on the location of the acquisition, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations that may differ from those of the states in which our operations are currently conducted.\n\u00b7 We may acquire individual or group medical practices that operate with lower profit margins as compared with our current or expected profit margins or which have a different payor mix than our other practice groups, which would reduce our profit margins. Depending upon the nature of the local healthcare market, we may not be able to implement our business model in every local market that we enter, which may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\n\u00b7 If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders could be diluted, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. If we finance an acquisition with debt, it could result in higher leverage and interest costs. As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, and we may increase our acquisition costs.\nChanges to the fair value of contingent payments to be paid in connection with our acquisitions may result in significant fluctuations to our results of operations.\nIn connection with our recent acquisitions we are required to make certain contingent payments. The fair value of such payments is re-evaluated periodically based on changes in our estimate of future operating results and changes in market discount rates. Any changes in our estimated fair value are recognized in our results of operations. Increases in the amount of contingent payments were are required to make may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur management team\u2019s attention may be diverted by recent acquisitions and searches for new acquisition targets, and our business and operations may suffer adverse consequences as a result.\nMergers and acquisitions are time intensive, requiring significant commitment of our management team\u2019s focus and resources. If our management team spends too much time focused on recent acquisitions or on potential acquisition targets, our management team may not have sufficient time to focus on our existing business and operations. This diversion of attention could have material and adverse consequences on our operations and our ability to be profitable.\nWe may be unable to scale our operations successfully.\nOur growth strategy will place significant demands on our management and financial, administrative and other resources. Operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If the Company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of its operations, then the quality of its services, its ability to retain key personnel, and its business could be harmed.\nWe could experience significant losses under our capitation-based contracts if the medical expenses we incur exceed revenues.\nIn California, health plans typically prospectively pay an IPA a fixed Per Member Per Month amount, or capitation payment, which is often based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments to IPAs, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which the IPA manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that IPA. If our IPAs are able to manage care-related expenses under the capitated levels we realize an operating profit on our capitation contracts. However, if our care-related expenses exceed projected levels, our IPAs may realize substantial operating deficits, which are not capped and could lead to substantial losses for our Company.\nOur future growth could be harmed if we lose the services of certain key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Warren Hosseinion, M.D., for the management of our business and implementation of our business strategy. We have entered into employment agreements with Dr. Hosseinion and we hold a $5 million key man life insurance policy. The loss of Dr. Hosseinion or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current principal stockholders have significant influence over us and they could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree. This includes that Warren Hosseinion, M.D. and Adrian Vazquez, M.D., combined currently own more than 40% of our shares and have significant influence over our operations and strategic direction.\nOur executive officers and directors, together with holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, as a group, currently beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers, directors and holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock will have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:\n\u00b7 changes to the composition of our Board of Directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;\n\u00b7 proposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and\n\u00b7 amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock.\nThis concentration of ownership of shares of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open market purchase programs or other purchases of shares of our common stock that might otherwise give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock. The interests of our executive officers, directors and holders of greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock may not always coincide with the interests of the other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our stock price.\nThe concentration of ownership includes that Dr. Hosseinion (who currently owns approximately 21% of our shares) and Dr. Vazquez (who currently owns approximately 19% of our shares) together currently own over 40% of our shares of common stock and exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. As stockholders Dr. Hosseinion and Dr. Vazquez are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Their concentrated holding of such a significant block of shares may harm the value of our shares and discourage investors from being involved in our Company. They could also use their concentrated holdings to delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support.\nIf our agreements or arrangements with Dr. Hosseinion or physician groups are deemed invalid under state law, including laws against the corporate practice of medicine, or federal law, or are terminated as a result of changes in state law, it could have a material impact on our profitability.\nThere are various state laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine which prohibit us from owning various health care entities. These corporate practice of medicine prohibitions are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician\u2019s professional judgment. These and other laws may also prevent fee-splitting, which is the sharing of professional service income with non-professional or business interests. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. As a result, we have structured other agreements and arrangements with these entities, which may not be as effective in providing control as direct ownership. If those agreements and arrangements were held to be invalid under state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine, a significant portion of our revenues could be affected, which may result in a material adverse effect upon our Company. Further, changes to federal or state law that made regulated or prohibited such agreements or arrangements could also have a material adverse effect upon our profitability and operations.\nWe rely on certain key affiliated entities that are owned by key personnel who could stop services to our Company. Any failure by our key affiliated entities or their equity holders to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also own the majority, and not all, of the equity of our key subsidiaries.\nWe consolidate in our financial reporting and business structure various affiliated physician practice groups. If we had direct ownership of certain of our affiliated entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes in the boards of directors of those entities, which could effect changes at the management and operational level. Under our contractual arrangements, we may not be able to directly change the members of the boards of directors of these entities and would have to rely on the entities and the entities\u2019 equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the entities. If any of these affiliated entities or their equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements\nFurther, many of those entities are either wholly-owned or primarily owned by Dr. Hosseinion. If Dr. Hosseinion died, was incapacitated or otherwise was no longer affiliated with our Company there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, MMG and other affiliated medical physician practice groups are or may be owned by other medical doctors who could also die, become incapacitated or otherwise become no longer affiliated with our Company, which might have a material adverse effect on our business. Although the terms of the contractual agreements provide that they will be binding on the successors of the entities\u2019 equity holders, as those successors are not a party to the agreements, it is uncertain whether the successors in case of the death, bankruptcy or divorce of an equity holder will be subject to or will be willing to honor the obligations of such agreements.\nIn addition, although we consolidate in our financial reporting and business structure ApolloMed ACO and ApolloMed Palliative, individuals other than Dr. Hosseinion also own approximately 30% of the equity of ApolloMed ACO and 49% of the equity in ApolloMed Palliative.\nApolloMed\u2019s operations are dependent on a few payors.\nWe had three payors during the year ended March 31, 2015 that accounted for 34.8%, 13.2% and 12.3% of net revenues, respectively. During the year ended January 31, 2014, we had three payors that accounted for 17.8%, 15.9% and 13.9% of net revenues (unaudited), respectively. We believe that, going forward, a substantial portion of its revenue could be derived from a select few payors. Each payor may immediately terminate any of our contracts or any individual credentialed physician upon the occurrence of certain events. They may also amend the material terms of the contracts under certain circumstances. Failure to maintain the contracts on favorable terms, for any reason, would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A material decline in the number of patients we serve could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nApolloMed ACO may not generate savings through its participation in the MSSP, and any revenue generated by such participation will be periodic and will occur, if at all, on an annual basis. The payment of the shared savings could happen irregularly.\nApolloMed ACO participates in the MSSP sponsored by the CMS. The MSSP allows ACO participants to share in cost savings that are generated in connection with rendering medical services to Medicare patients. Payments to ACO participants, if any, are calculated annually by CMS on cost savings generated by the ACO participants relative to the ACO participants trailing medical service history. The MSSP is a newly formed program with limited history of payments to ACO participants. As a result of the uncertain nature of the MSSP program, the Company considers revenue, if any, under the MSSP, as contingent upon the realization of program savings as determined by CMS, and revenues are not considered earned and therefore are not recognized until notice from CMS that cash payments are to be imminently received.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company was awarded and received approximately a $5.4 million payment related to savings achieved from July 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013, for its participation in the MSSP which represented 16% of our net revenue during the year ended March 31, 2015. Since payments, if any, are made on an annual basis, the Company will not receive such payments during each quarter, and consequently, revenue may be materially lower in quarters when MSSP related payments are not received. In addition, there is no assurance that the Company will meet the conditions necessary for receipt of future payments. Further, the Company\u2019s ability to continue to generate savings for the MSSP program depends on many factors, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control, including, among others, how the CMS elects to administer the MSSP program, how savings levels are calculated and continued political support of the MSSP program. As a result, whether future revenues will be earned by ApolloMed ACO is uncertain, and, if such amounts are payable, they will be paid on an annual basis significantly after the time earned, and will be contingent on various factors, including whether savings were determined to be achieved in 2015 or in any other period during which savings are measured.\nRisk-sharing arrangements that Maverick Medical Group, Inc. has with health plans and hospitals could result in their costs exceeding the corresponding revenues, which could reduce or eliminate any shared risk profitability. Maverick Medical Group, Inc. also has a key contract with Prospect Medical Group (\u201cPMG\u201d) and its management service organization, which if terminated could materially affect our business.\nMMG\u2019s risk-sharing arrangements may require MMG to assume a portion of any loss sustained from such arrangements, thereby adversely affecting our consolidated results of operations. Under these risk-sharing arrangements, MMG is responsible for a portion of the cost of hospital services or other services that are not capitated. The terms of the particular risk-sharing arrangement allocate responsibility to the respective parties when the cost of services exceeds the related revenue, which results in a deficit, or permit the parties to share in any surplus amounts when actual costs are less than the related revenue. The amount of non-capitated medical and hospital costs in any period could be affected by factors beyond the control of MMG, such as changes in treatment protocols, new technologies, longer lengths of stay by the patient, and inflation. To the extent that such non-capitated medical and hospital costs are higher than anticipated, revenue may not be sufficient to cover the risk-sharing deficits the health plans and MMG are responsible for, which could reduce our revenues and income.\nMMG has further entered into a contract with PMG\u2019s management service organization (\u201cPMSO\u201d) that has a term through September 28, 2020 and automatically renews unless either party provides notice, pursuant to which, among other services, PMSO provides claims processing, authorizations and credentialing for certain physicians. Additionally, under another contract with PMG that has a term through September 28, 2015 and automatically renews unless either party provides notice, MMG accesses some health plan contracts by using PMG as the risk-bearing contracting party with those health plans. Any disruption or change in the condition of PMG\u2019s operations, or any changes to our contracts with PMSO or PMG, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEconomic conditions or changing consumer preferences could adversely impact our business.\nA downturn in economic conditions in one or more of the Company\u2019s markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. Historically, state budget limitations have resulted in reduced state spending. Given that Medicaid is a significant component of state budgets, a downturn would put continued cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in California and the other states in which we operate. In addition, an economic downturn, coupled with sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by the government as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce government expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we attempt to stay informed of government and customer trends, any sustained failure to identify and respond to trends could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the ability to adapt to a changing market and continued development of additional services.\nAlthough we expect to provide a broad and competitive range of services, there can be no assurance of acceptance by the marketplace. The procurement of new contracts by the Company may be dependent upon the continuing results achieved at the current facilities, upon pricing and operational considerations, as well as the potential need for continuing improvement to existing services. Moreover, the markets for such services may not develop as expected nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in our marketing of any such services.\nCompetition for physicians is intense, and we may not be able to hire and retain physicians to provide services.\nWe are dependent on our affiliated physicians to provide services and generate revenue. We compete with many types of healthcare providers, including teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and other practice groups, for the services of clinicians. The limited number of residents entering the job market each year and the limited number of other licensed providers seeking to change employers makes it challenging to meet our hiring needs and may require us to contract locum tenens physicians or to increase physician compensation in a manner that decreases our profit margins. The limited number of residents and other licensed providers also impacts our ability to recruit new physicians with the expertise necessary to provide services within our business and our ability to renew contracts with existing physicians on acceptable terms. If we do not do so, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected. Our physician turnover rate has remained stable over the last three years. If the turnover rate were to increase significantly, our growth could be impeded.\nMoreover, unlike some of our competitors who sometimes pay additional compensation to physicians who agree to provide services exclusively to that competitor, our IPAs have historically not entered into such exclusivity agreements and have allowed our affiliated physicians to affiliate with multiple IPAs. This practice may place us at a competitive disadvantage regarding the hiring and retention of physicians relative to those competitors who do enter into such exclusivity agreements.\nThe healthcare industry continues to experience shortages in qualified service employees and management personnel, and we may be unable to hire qualified employees.\nWe compete with other healthcare providers for our employees, both clinical associates and management personnel. As the demand for health services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified staff, we and our competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals. Furthermore, the competition for this shrinking labor market has created turnover as many seek to take advantage of the supply of available positions, each offering new and more attractive wage and benefit packages. In addition to the wage pressures described above, the cost of training new employees amid the turnover rates may cause added pressure on our operating margins. Lastly, the market for qualified nurses and therapists is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our home health and hospice operations, which are particularly dependent on nurses for patient care.\nThe health care industry is competitive.\nThere are other companies and individuals currently providing health care services. We compete directly with national, regional and local providers of inpatient healthcare for patients and physicians. Other companies could enter the market in the future and divert some or all of our business. On a national basis, our competitors include, but are not limited to, Team Health, EmCare, DaVita HealthCare Partners and Heritage Provider Network, each of which may have greater financial and other resources available to them. We also compete with physician groups and privately-owned health care companies in each of our local markets. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions, which would have an adverse impact on our growth strategy. Since there are virtually no capital expenditures required to enter the industry, there are few financial barriers to entry. Individual physicians, physician groups and companies in other healthcare industry segments, including hospitals with which we have contracts, some of which have greater financial, marketing and staffing resources, may become competitors in providing health care services, and this competition may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with independent providers such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive, particularly in California.\nFurther, as we have expanded into palliative, home health and hospice care through the launch of ApolloMed Palliative, we face competitors that have traditionally concentrated in this segment and that may have greater resources and specialized expertise than us. In many areas in which our palliative, home health and hospice care programs are located, we compete with a large number of organizations, including:\n\u00b7 community-based home health and hospice providers;\n\u00b7 national and regional companies;\n\u00b7 hospital-based home health agencies, hospice and palliative care programs; and\n\u00b7 nursing homes.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete with these competitors in palliative, home health and hospice care, and may expend significant resources without success.\nWe are reliant on referrals from third parties for our services.\nOur business is reliant on referrals from third parties for our services. We receive referrals from community medical providers, emergency departments, payors, and hospitals in the same manner as other medical professionals receive patient referrals. We do not provide compensation or other remuneration to our referral sources for referring patients to us. A decrease in these referrals due to competition, concerns about the quality of our services, and other factors could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and adversely impact our financial condition. Similarly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain preferred provider status with significant third-party payors in the communities where we operate. If we are unable to maintain our referral base or our preferred provider status with significant third-party payors, it may negatively impact our revenues and our financial performance.\nHospitals and other inpatient and post-acute care facilities (collectively \u201cfacilities\u201d) may terminate their agreements with us or reduce the fees they pay us.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2015, we derived approximately 13% of our net revenue for physician services from contracts directly with facilities. Our current partner facilities may decide not to renew our contracts, introduce unfavorable terms, or reduce fees paid to us. Any of these events may impact the ability of our practice groups to operate at such facilities, which would negatively impact our revenue and profitability.\nSome of the hospitals where our affiliated physicians provide services may have their medical staff closed to non-contracted physicians.\nIn general, our affiliated physicians may only provide services in a hospital where they have certain credentials, called privileges, which are granted by the medical staff and controlled by legally binding medical staff bylaws of the hospital. The medical staff decides who will receive privileges, and the medical staff of the hospitals where we currently provide services or wish to provide services could decide that non-contracted physicians can no longer receive privileges to practice there. Such a decision would limit our ability to furnish services in a hospital, decrease the number of our affiliated physicians who could provide services, or preclude us from entering new hospitals. In addition, hospitals may attempt to enter into exclusive contracts for physician services, which would reduce access to certain populations of patients within the hospital.\nWe may have difficulty collecting payments from third-party payors in a timely manner.\nWe derive significant revenue from third-party payors, and delays in payment or audits leading to refunds to payors may impact our net revenue. In particular, we rely on some key governmental payors. We assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed payments. Governmental payors typically pay on a more extended payment cycle, which could result in our incurring expenses prior to receiving corresponding revenue. In the current healthcare environment, payors are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare, including proposals to revise coverage and reimbursement policies. We may experience difficulties in collecting our revenue because third-party payors may seek to reduce or delay payment to which we believe we are entitled. If we are not paid fully and in a timely manner for such services or there is a finding that we were incorrectly paid, our revenues, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business model depends on numerous complex management information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could undermine our ability to receive ACO payments and otherwise materially harm our operations and result in potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.\nWe depend on a complex, specialized, integrated management information system and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for our billing operations. We may be unable to enhance our existing management information systems or implement new management information systems where necessary. Additionally, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications, or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems. Our management information systems may require modifications, improvements, or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to implement these systems is subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist us in creating and implementing these systems. Our failure to successfully implement and maintain all of our systems could undermine our ability to receive ACO shared savings payments and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our failure to successfully operate our billing systems could lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We have identified a number of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. These material weaknesses could allow the reporting of inaccurate or incomplete information regarding our business in our public filings and will require the Company to devote substantial resources to mitigating and resolving the weaknesses we have identified.\nAdditionally, we intend to continue to grow our business through the acquisition of new entities. When we acquire such existing entities our due diligence may fail to discover defects or deficiencies in the design and operations of the internal controls over financial reporting of such entities, or defects or deficiencies in the internal controls over financial reporting may arise when we try to integrate the operations of these newly acquired companies with our own. We can provide no assurances that we will not experience such issues in future acquisitions, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nThe requirements of remaining a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business.\nWe are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements are time-consuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may write off intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nOur intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Under current accounting standards, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and we may be subject to impairment losses as circumstances change after an acquisition. If we record an impairment loss related to our goodwill, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year in which the impairment is recorded.\nACOs are new and unproven and CMS may discontinue, alter or radically change the MSSP program.\nThe Company has invested resources in both applying to participate in the MSSP and in establishing initial infrastructure. The MSSP program and the rules regarding ACOs are new and may be altered in the future. Any material change to the MSSP program and ACO requirements, governance and operating rules, could provide a significant financial risk for the Company and alter the strategic direction of the Company thereby producing stockholder risk and uncertainty. In addition, the Company could be terminated from the MSPP if it does not comply with the CMS MSSP participation requirements.\nThe Company currently derives 100% of its revenues in only California.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are primarily in one state, California. While the Company operates through ApolloMed ACO outside of California, it has not derived any revenues from operations outside of California, and, it currently derives all of its revenues from California. Any material changes by California with respect to strategy, taxation and economics of healthcare delivery and reimbursements could produce an adverse effect on the continued business operations of Company.\nA prolonged disruption of the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our future access to capital, our cost of capital and our ability to continue operations.\nWe have relied on the capital and credit markets for liquidity and to execute our business strategies, which include increasing our revenue base through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Volatility and disruption of the U.S. capital and credit markets may adversely affect our access to capital and increase our cost of capital. Should current economic and market conditions deteriorate, our ability to finance our ongoing operations and our expansion may be adversely affected, we may be unable to raise necessary funds, our cost of debt or equity capital may increase significantly and future access to capital markets may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed.\nOur intellectual property rights, including those rights related to our \u201cApolloMed\u201d unregistered trademark and some other trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, are important assets for us. We do not hold any patents protecting our intellectual property. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our business. For example, we may be subject to third-party intellectual property rights claims, and our technologies may not be able to withstand any such claims. Regardless of the merits of the claims, any intellectual property claims could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, if any claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our practices that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We also may have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses or may not be available to us at all. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets and other critical confidential information through contractual agreements, which may be breached.\nThere are a number of third parties, service providers, and others who have access to our confidential information. While we have attempted to protect this information through confidentiality agreements and other protective arrangements, it is difficult to detect and demonstrate a breach of any of these agreements or arrangements, and our confidential information may be leaked and used by other companies that compete in our industry. Any such use of our information could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future business plans.\nMany of our agreements with hospitals and medical groups are relatively short term or may be terminated without cause by providing advance notice, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, operations and future business plans.\nMany of our hospitalist and other operating agreements are relatively short term or may be terminated without cause by providing advance notice. If these agreements are terminated at the end of their term, are not renewed or are terminated before the end of their term, we would lose the revenues generated by those agreements. Any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, operations and future business plans.\nMany of our agreements with hospitals and medical groups include prohibitions on our hiring physicians or patients or competing with the hospital or medical group, which limits our ability to implement our business plan in certain areas.\nBecause many of our hospitalist and other operating agreements include prohibitions on our hiring physicians or patients or competing with the hospital or medical group, our ability to hire physicians, attract patients or conduct business in certain areas may be limited in some cases.\nApolloMed ACO has entered into an agreement with PMG that may limit its ability to sell its operations.\nApolloMed ACO has entered into an agreement with PMG that prevents ApolloMed ACO from selling its operations without PMG\u2019s having the option to purchase the ApolloMed ACO network of physicians who were contracted with PMG and introduced to ApolloMed ACO by PMG. We estimate that no more than 20 physicians would currently be subject to PMG\u2019s purchase option, which takes effect only if ApolloMed ACO elects to sell its operations. PMG\u2019s option to purchase certain ApolloMed ACO physicians, unless terminated, may limit our ability to sell our ApolloMed ACO operations if we decide to do so.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nThe healthcare industry is complex and intensely regulated at the federal, state, and local levels and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations.\nAs a company involved in the provision of healthcare services, we are subject to a myriad of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. There are significant costs involved in complying with these laws and regulations. Moreover, if we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal damages, fines, sanctions, or penalties, including exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We may also be required to change our method of operations. These consequences could be the result of current conduct or even conduct that occurred a number of years ago. We also could incur significant costs merely if we become the subject of an additional investigation or legal proceeding alleging a violation of these laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether a federal, state, or local government will determine that we are not operating in accordance with law, or whether the laws will change in the future and impact our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more significant healthcare laws and regulations that affect us:\n\u00b7 federal laws, including the federal False Claims Act, that provide for penalties against entities and individuals which knowingly or recklessly make claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and other governmental healthcare programs, as well as third-party payors, that contain or are based upon false or fraudulent information;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cAnti-Kickback Statute,\u201d that prohibits the knowing and willful offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for the referral or recommendation of patients for items and services covered, in or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Stark Law or physician self-referral law, that (subject to limited exceptions) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to an entity for the provision of specific \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or a member of such physician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship with the entity, and prohibits the entity from billing for services arising out of such prohibited referrals;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act that provides for criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose known overpayments;\n\u00b7 a provision of the Social Security Act that provides for civil monetary penalties on healthcare providers who fail to repay known overpayments within 60 days of identification or the date any corresponding cost report was due, if applicable, and also allows improper retention of known overpayments to serve as a basis for False Claims Act violations;\n\u00b7 state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, which typically are not limited to relationships involving governmental payors;\n\u00b7 provisions of, and regulations relating to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) that provide penalties for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud a health-care benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u00b7 provisions of HIPAA and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) limiting how covered entities, business associates and business associate sub-contractors may use and disclose PHI and the security measures that must be taken in connection with protecting that information and related systems, as well as similar or more stringent state laws;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws that provide penalties for providers for billing and receiving payment from a governmental healthcare program for services unless the services are medically necessary and reasonable, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;\n\u00b7 federal laws that provide for administrative sanctions, including civil monetary penalties for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federal healthcare programs, payments by hospitals to physicians for reducing or limiting services to Medicare or Medicaid patients , or employing or contracting with individuals or entities who/which are excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to enroll in the Medicare and Medicaid programs before submitting any claims for services, to promptly report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs, and to re-enroll in these programs when changes in direct or indirect ownership occur or in response to revalidation requests from Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 state laws that prohibit general business entities from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging in certain practices, such as splitting fees with physicians;\n\u00b7 laws in some states that prohibit non-domiciled entities from owning and operating medical practices in their states;\n\u00b7 provisions of the Social Security Act (emanating from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the \u201cDRA\u201d)) that require entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5 million or more from a single Medicaid program to provide their employees, contractors and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state false claims acts and related statutes, that establish a new Medicaid Integrity Program designed to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse, and that increase financial incentives for both states and individuals to bring fraud and abuse claims against healthcare companies; and\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and regulations restricting the techniques that may be used to collect past due accounts from consumers, such as our patients, for services provided to the consumer.\nWe cannot predict the effect that the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) and its implementation may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe ACA was signed into law, in two parts, on March 23, 2010 and March 30, 2010. The ACA dramatically alters the U.S. healthcare system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. The ACA attempts to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding Medicare and Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments to providers, expanding the Medicare program\u2019s use of value-based purchasing programs, tying hospital payments to the satisfaction of quality criteria, bundling payments to hospitals and other providers, and instituting private health insurance reforms. Although a majority of the measures contained in the ACA just recently became effective, some of the reductions in Medicare spending, such as negative adjustments to the Medicare hospital inpatient and outpatient prospective payment system market basket updates and the incorporation of productivity adjustments to the Medicare program\u2019s annual inflation updates, became effective in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Although the expansion of health insurance coverage should increase revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals, many of these provisions of the ACA will continue to become effective beyond 2015, and the impact of such expansion may be gradual and may not offset scheduled decreases in reimbursement.\nOn June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, including the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d provisions of the ACA that generally require all individuals to obtain healthcare insurance or pay a penalty. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also held that the provision of the ACA that authorized the Secretary of HHS to penalize states that choose not to participate in the expansion of the Medicaid program by removing all of their existing Medicaid funding was unconstitutional. In response to the ruling, a number of U.S. governors, including those of some states in which we intend to operate, have stated that they oppose their state\u2019s participation in the expanded Medicaid program, which could result in the ACA not providing coverage to some low-income persons in those states. In addition, several bills have been and may continue to be introduced in Congress to repeal or amend all or significant provisions of the ACA.\nThe ACA changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. The net effect of the ACA on our business is subject to numerous variables, including the law\u2019s complexity, lack of complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation or possible amendment, as well as the uncertainty as to the extent to which states will choose to participate in the expanded.\nThe Health Care Reform Act also mandates changes specific to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the Health Care Reform Act mandates creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning with federal year 2014 that will be phased-in over a four-year period, and a reduction in the outlier cap. In addition, the Health Care Reform Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with specific conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services (including emergency department services), and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Health Care Reform Act further directs the Secretary to rebase payments for home health, which will result in a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning in 2014 that will be phased-in over a four-year period. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate cost and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and provide a report to Congress. Beginning October 1, 2012, the annual market basket rate increase for hospice providers was reduced by a formula that caused payment rates to be lower than in the prior year.\nProviders in the healthcare industry are the subject of federal and state investigations, as well as payor audits.\nDue to our participation in government and private healthcare programs, we are sometimes involved in inquiries, reviews, audits and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing and documentation requirements. Federal and state government agencies have active civil and criminal enforcement efforts that include investigations of healthcare companies, and their executives and managers. Under some circumstances, these investigations can also be initiated by private individuals under whistleblower provisions which may be incentivized by the possibility for private recoveries. The DRA revised federal law to further encourage these federal, state and individually-initiated investigations against healthcare companies.\nResponding to these audit and enforcement activities can be costly and disruptive to our business operations, even when the allegations are without merit. If we are subject to an audit or investigation and a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed, we may be required to repay these agencies or private payors, or we may be subjected to pre-payment reviews, which can be time-consuming and result in non-payment or delayed payment for the services we provide. We also may be subject to other financial sanctions or be required to modify our operations.\nControls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.\nControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization review,\u201d have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost on a post-discharge basis. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. The ACA potentially expands the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use, and, as a result, efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Utilization review is also a requirement of most non-governmental managed care organizations and other third-party payors. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by third party payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nLaws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which we are permitted to conduct our business and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to penalties or require a corporate restructuring.\nSome states have laws that prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in some arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. California is one of the states that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine.\nIn California, we operate by maintaining contracts with our affiliated physician groups which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide physician services. Under these arrangements, we provide management services, receive a management fee for providing non-medical management services, do not represent that we offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the affiliated physician groups.\nIn addition to the above management arrangements, we have some contractual rights relating to the transfer of equity interests in some of our affiliated physician groups, to a third party designated by us, through Physician Shareholders agreements with Dr. Hosseinion, the controlling equity holder of such affiliated physician groups. However, such equity interests cannot be transferred to or held by us or by any non-professional organization. Accordingly, we do not directly own any equity interests in any physician groups in California. In the event that any of these affiliated physician groups fails to comply with the management arrangement or any management arrangement is terminated and/or we are unable to enforce its contractual rights over the orderly transfer of equity interests in its affiliated physician groups, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf there is a change in accounting principles or the interpretation thereof by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), affecting consolidation of entities, it could impact our consolidation of total revenues derived from such affiliated physician groups.\nOur financial statements are consolidated and include the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries and various non-owned affiliated physician groups that are variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), which consolidation is effectuated in accordance with applicable accounting rules. In the event of a change in accounting principles promulgated by FASB or in FASB\u2019s interpretation of its principles, or if there were an adverse determination by a regulatory agency or a court or if there were a change in state or federal law relating to the ability to maintain present agreements or arrangements with such physician groups, we may not be permitted to continue to consolidate the total revenues of such organizations.\nAccounting rules require that under some circumstances the VIE consolidation model be applied when a reporting enterprise holds a variable interest (e.g., equity interests, debt obligations, certain management and service contracts) in a legal entity. Under this model, an enterprise must assess the entity in which it holds a variable interest to determine whether it meets the criteria to be consolidated as a VIE. If the entity is a VIE, the consolidation framework next identifies the party, if one exists, that possesses a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and requires that party to consolidate as the primary beneficiary. An enterprise\u2019s determination of whether it has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires that a qualitative determination be made, and is not solely based on voting rights.\nIf an enterprise determines the entity in which it holds a variable interest is not subject to the VIE guidance in ASC 810, the enterprise should apply the traditional voting control model (also outlined in ASC 810) which focuses on voting rights. In our case, the VIE consolidation model applies to our controlled, but not owned, physician affiliated entities. Our determination regarding the consolidation of our affiliates could be challenged, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur developing palliative care business is subject to rules, prohibitions, regulations and reimbursement requirements that differ from those that govern our primary home health and hospice operations.\nWe continue to develop our palliative care services, which is a type of care focused upon relieving pain and suffering in patients who do not quality for, or who have not yet elected, the hospice benefit. The continued development of this business line exposes us to additional risks, in part because the business line requires us to comply with additional Federal and state laws and regulations that differ from those that govern our home health and hospice business. This line of business requires compliance with different Federal and state requirements governing licensure, enrollment, documentation, prescribing, coding, billing and collection of coinsurance and deductibles, among other requirements. Additionally, some states have prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, which generally prohibit business entities from owning or controlling medical practices or may limit the ability of Clinical Professionals to share professional service income with non-professional or business interests. These requirements may vary significantly from state to state. Reimbursement for palliative care and house calls services is generally conditioned on our clinical professionals providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service itself and the medical necessity for the service. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information, or the incorrect selection of codes for the level and type of service provided, could result in non-payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. Further, compliance with applicable regulations may cause us to incur expenses that we have not anticipated, and if we are unable to comply with these additional legal requirements, we may incur liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur developing palliative care business line is subject to new licensing requirements, which will require us to expend resources to comply with the changing requirements.\nIn October 2013, California enacted the Home Care Services Consumer Protection Act. The act establishes a licensing program for home care organizations, and requires background checks, basic training, and tuberculosis screening for the aides that are employed by home care organizations. Home care organizations and aides had until January 1, 2015 to comply with the new licensing and background check requirements. Because we operate in California, the requirements of the act are expected to impose additional costs on us.\nWe do not have a limited Knox-Keene License.\nWe do not hold a limited Knox-Keene license (a managed care plan license issued pursuant to the California Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975). If the Department of Managed Health Care were to determine that we have been inappropriately taking risk for institutional and professional services as a result of our various hospital and physician arrangements without having a limited Knox-Keene license, we may be required to obtain a limited Knox-Keene license to resolve such violations and we could be subject to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by the failure of our affiliated physicians to appropriately document services they provide.\nWe rely upon our affiliated physicians to appropriately and accurately complete necessary medical record documentation and assign appropriate reimbursement codes for their services. Reimbursement to us is conditioned on our affiliated physicians providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, and the medical necessity for the services. If our affiliated physicians have provided incorrect or incomplete documentation or selected inaccurate reimbursement codes, this could result in nonpayment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors and result in recoupments or refund demands, affecting revenue already received.\nChanges associated with reimbursement by third-party payors for the Company\u2019s services may adversely affect operating results and financial condition.\nThe medical services industry is undergoing significant changes with third-party payors that are taking measures to reduce reimbursement rates or in some cases, denying reimbursement altogether. There is no assurance that third-party payors will continue to pay for the services provided by our affiliated medical groups. Failure of third party payors to adequately cover the medical services so provided by the Company will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nCompliance with federal and state privacy and information security laws is expensive, and we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches.\nWe must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and confidentiality of patient health information (\u201cPHI\u201d), including HIPAA and HITECH. As part of our medical record keeping, third-party billing, and other services, we collect and maintain PHI in paper and electronic format. Therefore, new privacy or security laws, whether implemented pursuant to federal or state action, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle healthcare-related data and communicate with payors. In addition, compliance with these standards could impose significant costs on us or limit our ability to offer services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us. Despite our efforts to prevent security and privacy breaches, they may still occur. If any non-compliance with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI results in privacy or security breaches, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or even criminal sanctions.\nAs a result of the expanded scope of HIPAA through HITECH, we may incur significant costs in order to minimize the amount of \u201cunsecured PHI\u201d we handle and retain or to implement improved administrative, technical or physical safeguards to protect PHI. We may incur significant costs in order to demonstrate and document whether there is a low probability that the PHI has been compromised in order to overcome the presumption that an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI results in a reportable breach. We may incur significant costs to notify the relevant individuals, government entities, and, in some cases, the media, in the event of a breach and to provide appropriate remediation and monitoring to mitigate the possible damage done by any such breach.\nProviders must be properly enrolled in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, before they can receive reimbursement for providing services, and there may be delays in the enrollment process.\nEach time a new affiliated physician joins us, we must enroll the affiliated physician under our applicable group identification number for Medicare and Medicaid programs and for certain managed care and private insurance programs before we can receive reimbursement for services the physician renders to beneficiaries of those programs. The estimated time to receive approval for the enrollment is sometimes difficult to predict and, in recent years, the Medicare program carriers often have not issued these numbers to our affiliated physicians in a timely manner. These practices result in delayed reimbursement that may adversely affect our cash flow and revenues.\nWe may face malpractice and other lawsuits that may not be covered by insurance.\nMalpractice lawsuits are common in the healthcare industry. The medical malpractice legal environment varies greatly by state. The status of tort reform, availability of non-economic damages or the presence or absence of other statutes, such as elder abuse or vulnerable adult statutes, influence the incidence and severity of malpractice litigation. We may also be subject to other types of lawsuits which may involve large claims and significant defense costs. Many states have joint and several liability for all healthcare providers who deliver care to a patient and are at least partially liable. As a result, if one healthcare provider is found liable for medical malpractice for the provision of care to a particular patient, all other healthcare providers who furnished care to that same patient, including possibly our affiliated physicians, may also share in the full liability which may be substantial.\nWe currently maintain malpractice liability insurance coverage to cover professional liability and other claims for certain hospitalists and clinic physicians. All of our physicians are required to carry first dollar coverage with limits of coverage equal to $1,000,000 for all claims based on occurrence up to an aggregate of $3,000,000 per year. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us, our affiliated professional organizations or our affiliated physicians, and we cannot provide assurance that any future liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our professional liability insurance coverage generally must be renewed annually and may not continue to be available to us in future years at acceptable costs and on favorable terms.\nWe have established reserves for potential medical liabilities losses which are subject to inherent uncertainties and a deficiency in the established reserves may lead to a reduction in our net income.\nThe Company establishes reserves for estimates of incurred but not reported claims (\u201cIBNR\u201d) due to contracted physicians, hospitals, and other professional providers and risk-pool liabilities. IBNR estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables, including the utilization of health care services, historical payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, changes in membership, and other factors. Many of the medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services. Such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation. The inherent difficult in interpreting contracts and the estimated level of necessary reserves could result in significant fluctuations in our estimates from period to period. It is possible that actual losses and related expenses may differ, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If subsequent claims exceed our estimated reserves, we may be required to increase reserves, which would lead to a reduction in our future net income.\nLitigation expenses may be material.\nIn recent periods, we have incurred increased expenses for legal fees, in particular fees related to the defense of the lawsuits by certain competitors that are described under \u201cLEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\u201d While we maintain the insurance coverage described above, such insurance may not cover these lawsuits or some other types of commercial disputes. The defense of litigation, including fees of external legal counsel, expert witnesses and related costs, is expensive and may be difficult to project accurately. In general, such costs are unrecoverable even if we ultimately prevail in litigation, and could represent a significant portion of our limited capital resources. To defend lawsuits, we also find it necessary to divert officers and other employees from their normal business functions to gather evidence, give testimony and otherwise support litigation efforts. We expect to experience higher than normal litigation costs until the lawsuits by our competitor are decided.\nIf we lose any material litigation, including the litigation described under \u201cLEGAL PROCEEDINGS,\u201d we could face material judgments or awards. The outcome of such actions and proceedings, however, cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in a future period.\nWe may also in the future find it necessary to file lawsuits to recover damages or protect our interests. The cost of such litigation could also be significant and unrecoverable, which may also deter us from aggressively pursuing even legitimate claims.\nWe may be subject to litigation related to the agreements that our IPAs enter into with primary care physicians.\nIt is common in the medical services industry for primary care physicians to be affiliated with multiple IPAs. Our IPAs often enter into agreements with physicians who are also affiliated with our competitors. However, some of our competitors at times enter into agreements with physicians that require the physician to provide services exclusively to that competitor. Our IPAs often have no knowledge, and no way of knowing, whether a physician seeking to affiliate with us is subject to an exclusivity agreement unless the physician informs us of that agreement. Our IPAs rely on the physicians seeking to affiliate with us to determine whether they are able to enter into the proposed agreement. As described in \u201cLEGAL PROCEEDINGS,\u201d competitors have initiated lawsuits against us based in part on interference with such exclusivity agreements, and may do so in the future.\nChanges in the rates or methods of Medicare reimbursements may adversely affect our operations.\nIn order to participate in the Medicare program, we must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements. These programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue by increasing the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicare reimbursement for various services. Our business may be significantly and adversely affected by any such changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicare, TRICARE and other government healthcare programs.\nOur business also could be adversely affected by reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under these government programs, reductions in funding of these programs or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under these programs.\nOverall payments made by Medicare for hospice services are subject to cap amounts. Total Medicare payments to us for hospice services are compared to the cap amount for the hospice cap period, which runs from November 1 of one year through October 31 of the next year. CMS generally announces the cap amount in the month of July or August in the cap period and not at the beginning of the cap period. We must estimate the cap amount for the cap period before CMS announces the cap amount. If our estimate exceeds the later announced cap amount, we may suffer losses. CMS can also make retroactive adjustments to cap amounts announced for prior cap periods. Payments to us in excess of the cap amount must be returned to Medicare. A second hospice cap amount limits the number of days of inpatient care to not more than 20 percent of total patient care days within the cap period.\nAs part of its review of the Medicare hospice benefit, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommended to Congress in its \u201cReport to Congress: Medicare Payment Policy-March 2009\u201d (the \u201c2009 MedPAC Report\u201d) that Congress direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to change the Medicare payment system for hospice to:\n\u00b7 have relatively higher payments per day at the beginning of a patient\u2019s hospice care and relatively lower payments per day as the length of the duration of the hospice patient\u2019s stay increases; and\n\u00b7 include relatively higher payments for the costs associated with patient death at the end of the hospice patient\u2019s stay.\nIn addition, the Health Care Reform Act includes several provisions that could adversely impact hospice providers, including a provision to reduce the annual market basket update for hospice providers by a productivity adjustment. We cannot predict if the 2009 MedPAC Report recommendation will be enacted, whether any additional healthcare reform initiatives will be implemented, or whether the Health Care Reform Act or other changes in the administration of governmental healthcare programs or interpretations of governmental policies or other changes affecting the healthcare system will adversely affect our revenues. Further, due to budgetary concerns, several states have considered or are considering reducing or eliminating the Medicaid hospice benefit. Reductions or changes in Medicare or Medicaid funding could significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and our profitability.\nIf we inadvertently employ or contract with an excluded person, we may face government sanctions.\nIndividuals and entities can be excluded from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violating certain laws and regulations, or for other reasons such as the loss of a license in any state, even if the individual retains other licensure. This means that they (and all others) are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, and if the excluded individual is a physician, all services ordered (not just provided) by such physician are also non-covered and non-payable. Entities which employ or contract with excluded individuals are prohibited from billing the Medicare or Medicaid programs for the excluded individual\u2019s services, and are subject to civil monetary penalties if they do. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) maintains a list of excluded individuals and entities. Although we have instituted policies and procedures through our compliance program to minimize the risks, there can be no assurance that we will not inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or that any of our current employees or contracts will not become excluded in the future without our knowledge. If this occurs, we may be subject to substantial repayments and civil penalties and the hospitals at which we furnish services also may be subject to repayments and sanctions, for which they may seek recovery from us.\nWe may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.\nDue to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors or the uninsured may result in a reduction in our rates of reimbursement or an increase in our uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in our net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs or the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain with private insurance, changes in those programs could increase patient responsibility amounts, resulting in a greater risk for us of uncollectible receivables. Further, our hospice related business could become subject to \u201cquality star ratings,\u201d and, if sufficient quality is not achieved, reimbursement could be negatively impacted. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state laws may limit our effectiveness at collecting monies owed to us from patients.\nWe utilize third parties, whom we do not and cannot control, to collect from patients any co-payments and other payments for services that our physicians provide to patients. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act restricts the methods that third-party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. State laws vary with respect to debt collection practices, although most state requirements are similar to those under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If our collection practices or those of our collection agencies are inconsistent with these standards, we may be subject to actual damages and penalties. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, including changes to laws and regulations regarding or affecting healthcare reform or the healthcare industry, our business may be harmed.\nDue to the importance of the healthcare industry in the lives of all Americans, federal, state, and local legislative bodies frequently pass legislation and promulgate regulations relating to healthcare reform or that affect healthcare business. It is reasonable to believe that there may be increased federal oversight and regulation of the healthcare industry in the future. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on our business. It is possible that future legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures could adversely affect our business or could change the operating environment of the hospitals and other facilities where our physicians provide services. It is possible that the changes to the Medicare or other governmental healthcare program reimbursements may serve as precedent to possible changes in other payors\u2019 reimbursement policies in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursements could lead to adverse changes in Medicare and other governmental healthcare programs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, certain regulations not specifically targeting the health care industry also could have material effects on our operations. For example, the California Finance Lenders Law, Division 9, Sections 22000-22780 of the California Financial Code, could arguably apply to the Company as a result of its various affiliate and subsidiary loans and similar arrangements. If a regulator were to take the position that such loans were covered by the California Finance Lenders Law, we could be subject to regulatory action which could impair our ability to continue to operate and may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and business.\nWe may incur significant costs to adopt certain provisions under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act.\nHITECH was enacted into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among the many provisions of HITECH are those relating to the implementation and use of certified Electronic Health Records (\u201cEHR\u201d). Our patient medical records are maintained and under the custodianship of the healthcare facilities in which we operate. However, to adopt the use of EHRs utilized by these healthcare facilities, determine to adopt certain EHRs, or comply with any related provisions of HITECH, we may incur significant costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Other factors include:\n\u00b7 variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates by analysts;\n\u00b7 developments in the hospitalists markets;\n\u00b7 announcements of acquisitions dispositions and other corporate level transactions;\n\u00b7 announcements of financings and other capital raising transactions;\n\u00b7 sales of stock by our larger stockholders; and\n\u00b7 general stock market conditions.\nSome of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. We have been conditionally approved to uplist on Nasdaq Capital Market and, if we are successful in uplisting, we may be covered by more analysts. Our failure to meet their expectations and the projections in their reports could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. There is no assurance that the market price of our shares of common stock will not fall in the future.\nIf any of our historical offerings or sales of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 or affiliates\u2019 unregistered securities were found to be in violation of the Securities Act or state law, then the securities holders who purchased or received such securities may be able to sue to recover the consideration paid for their securities (or the equivalent value if such shares were issued for services) or for damages.\nHistorically, we have generally offered and sold our securities and the securities of our subsidiaries and affiliates in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or other available federal exemptions for offering securities. Similar reliance has been placed on exemptions under state laws from securities registration or qualification requirements. Our historical offerings or sales may not have qualified or met the requirements of any of such federal or state law exemptions due to, among other things, the sophistication of the investors, the adequacy of disclosure, the manner of distribution, or the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future. If rescission claims were successful, securities holders may be entitled to recover the consideration paid for the securities they purchased with interest thereon (or, to the extent securities were offered for services, the value thereof), or for damages. Furthermore, we could be forced to expend significant time and resources defending actions under these laws, even if we are ultimately successful in any defense.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWe have issued some of our directors, employees, consultants, lenders and other third parties securities that such parties may exercise or convert into shares of our common stock, which exercise would result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. For example, NNA has the right to exercise upon certain conditions being satisfied the warrants or the convertible note it acquired in connection with the credit and investment agreements we entered into with NNA on March 28, 2014. If NNA exercises such right, we will have to issue additional shares of common stock to NNA, which will dilute the ownership interests of our other stockholders. We will have to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with any conversion of the 9% convertible notes we previously issued.\nAdditionally, we may in the future issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in further dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. For example, we will have to issue additional shares of common stock to NNA if we fail to comply with NNA\u2019s registration rights.\nThe future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are currently traded at such time.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of certain anti-dilution rights afforded NNA.\nThe exercise price under the Warrants (defined below in \u201cOur Business - NNA Financing Arrangements\u201d) and the conversion price under the Convertible Note (defined below in \u201cOur Business - NNA Financing Arrangements\u201d) and the number of shares underlying such securities would be adjusted under certain circumstances, resulting in our issuance of additional securities. This adjustment would be triggered by the issuance of our common stock (or securities issuable into our common stock) at a price per share less than $9.00 per share. The anti-dilution protections described above do not apply to certain exempt issuances, including the sale of our common stock in a bona fide, firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the 1933 Act and with a purchase price per share of at least $20.00. In addition, these adjustments would terminate on the earlier of March 28, 2016 and the Company\u2019s closing of an equity financing yielding gross cash proceeds of at least $2,000,000.\nAdditionally, we may in the future issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, which may also trigger NNA\u2019s anti-dilution protections, and result in further dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nThere has been a limited trading market for our common stock to date.\nThere is limited trading volume in our common stock, which is quoted on the OTCQB under the trading symbol \u201cAMEH.\u201d It is anticipated that there will continue to be a limited trading market for our common stock on the OTCQB, and it is often difficult to obtain accurate price quotes for our stock on the OTCQB. A lack of an active market may impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell shares at the time they wish to sell shares or at a price that our stockholders consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies by using common stock as consideration.\nOur Credit Agreement with NNA prohibits payments of dividends without their prior consent and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nOur Credit Agreement with NNA prohibits payment of dividends without their prior consent and we do not expect to pay dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon obtaining the consent of NNA, our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nDelaware law and our Certificate of Incorporation could discourage a change in control, or an acquisition of us by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to you, and thereby adversely affect existing stockholders.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our Company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders. Delaware law imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d These provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation empowers the Board of Directors to establish and issue a class of preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of the preferred stock. These provisions give the Board of Directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock.\nAlthough we have been conditionally approved, we may elect not to uplist to the Nasdaq Capital Market or we not successfully obtain a listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market for our common stock. If we elect to uplist and obtain a listing, we may not be able to comply with continued listing standards.\nWe have been conditionally approved, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and meeting all of the Nasdaq Capital Market listing standards on the date we uplist, to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We currently do not meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s minimum initial listing standards, which generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders\u2019 equity, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at any point in the future. Even if we meet those listing standards, we may elect not to uplist. If the Nasdaq Capital Market does not list our common stock for trading on its exchange, either because we elect not to uplist or because we do not meet the listing standards, the consequences may include:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d If we list on the Nasdaq Capital Market, such securities will be covered securities However, we do not currently meet the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and may elect not to uplist even if we meet such standards in the future. As a result, our securities are not be covered securities and are subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market (if our application to uplist is unconditionally approved, and we elect to uplist) or the OTCQB could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nEven if our application to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market is approved, we meet the initial listing standards and we elect to uplist, thereafter if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the Nasdaq Capital Market may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we anticipate that we would take actions to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, stabilize our market price, improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s listing requirements.\nCompanies trading on the OTCQB, such as us, must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must be current in their reports under Section 13, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTCQB. If we fail to remain current in our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCQB. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nOur common stock may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC, and trading in our securities is very limited, which makes transactions in our common stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 3a51-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 requires:\n\u00b7 a broker or dealer to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u00b7 a broker or dealer receives a written agreement for the transaction from the investor, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u00b7 obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u00b7 make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, among other things:\n\u00b7 sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7 that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nWe engaged in a reverse stock split, which may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock.\nWe effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock in April 2015. The liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by the reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding following the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split may increase the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty affecting such sales.", "PERMNO": 17133, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "AMEH"}
