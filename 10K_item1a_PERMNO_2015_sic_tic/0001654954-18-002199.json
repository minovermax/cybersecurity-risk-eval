{"cik": "1702924", "company": "WRAP TECHNOLOGIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our company. You should consider these matters in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect additional losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect additional losses as we introduce BolaWrap 100 to the law enforcement market and until we achieve revenues and resulting margins to offset our operating costs. Our net loss for the period from inception (March 2, 2016) to December 31, 2016 was $234,356 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $833,545. Our ability to achieve future profitability is dependent on a variety of factors, many outside our control. Failure to achieve profitability or sustain profitability, if achieved, may require us to continue to raise additional financing which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our common stock.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan, and raising additional capital, if possible, by issuing additional equity securities may cause dilution to existing shareholders. In addition, raising additional capital by issuing additional debt financing may restrict our operations.\nWe may need additional capital to pay operating costs and support planned growth. While we may be able to generate some funds from product sales, existing working capital may not be sufficient. Principal factors affecting the availability of internally generated funds include:\n\u25cf\nfailure of product sales to meet planned projections;\n\u25cf\nworking capital requirements to support business growth;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control spending; and\n\u25cf\nacceptance of our product in planned markets.\nIn the event we are required to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders could be diluted significantly, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. In addition, the issuance of any equity securities could be at a discount to the market price.\nIf we incur debt financing, the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness may limit funds available for our business activities, and we could be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business and make distributions to our shareholders. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem stock or make investments. There is no assurance that any equity or debt financing transaction will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are a development stage technology company with no current revenues and limited experience developing security technology for law enforcement or other security personnel, as well as other areas required for the successful development and commercialization of BolaWrap 100, our first product, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a development stage technology company. We currently have no revenues, and we have not yet fully demonstrated an ability to overcome many of the fundamental risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by development stage companies in new and rapidly evolving fields of technology. To execute our business plan successfully, we will need to accomplish the following fundamental objectives, either on our own or with strategic collaborators:\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully commercialize BolaWrap 100, and develop future products for commercialization;\n\u25cf\ndevelop, obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for commercialization of products we produce;\n\u25cf\nestablish an intellectual property portfolio for BolaWrap 100 and other future products;\n\u25cf\nestablish and maintain sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, and/or enter into strategic partnering arrangements to access such capabilities;\n\u25cf\ngain market acceptance for BolaWrap 100 and/or other future products; and\n\u25cf\nobtain adequate capital resources and manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to research, production, development, regulatory approval and commercialization of BolaWrap 100 and/or other future products.\nOur principal product has not yet been produced in commercial quantities. We may incur significant and unpredictable warranty costs as our products are introduced and produced.\nOur principal product, BolaWrap 100, is just being introduced for testing into the marketplace. No assurance can be provided that we can successfully produce commercial quantities of our principal product or that additional development will be required for a commercially viable product. We generally expect to warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of up to one year from the date of purchase. We may incur substantial and unpredictable warranty costs from post-production product or component failures. Future warranty costs could further adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and business prospects.\nWe are materially dependent on the acceptance of our product by the law enforcement market. If law enforcement agencies do not purchase our product, our revenues will be adversely affected and we may not be able to expand into other markets, or otherwise continue as a going concern.\nA substantial number of law enforcement agencies may not purchase our remote restraint product. In addition, if our product is not widely accepted by the law enforcement market, we may not be able to expand sales of our product into other markets. Law enforcement agencies may be influenced by claims or perceptions that our product is not effective or may be used in an abusive manner. Sales of our product to these agencies may be delayed or limited by such claims or perceptions.\nWe will be dependent on sales of the BolaWrap 100 product, and if this product is not widely accepted, our growth prospects will be diminished.\nWe expect to depend on sales of the BolaWrap 100 and related cartridges for the foreseeable future. A lack of demand for this product, or its failure to achieve broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to manage our projected growth, our growth prospects may be limited and our future profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to expand our sales and marketing programs and our manufacturing capability. Rapid expansion may strain our managerial, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our systems, procedures, controls and management resources also may not be adequate to support our future operations. We will need to continually improve our operational, financial and other internal systems to manage our growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and profitability.\nWe may face personal injury and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nOur product is intended to be used in confrontations that could result in injury to those involved, whether or not involving our product. Our product may cause or be associated with such injuries. A person injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our product may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including personal injury, wrongful death, negligent design, dangerous product or inadequate warning. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our product. If successful, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Although we carry product liability insurance, significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, negative publicity and an award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through direct sales or distributors, and our inability to grow our sales force or recruit new distributors would negatively affect our sales.\nOur distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on direct sales and, in the future, independent distributors. Our inability to recruit and retain sales personnel and police equipment distributors who can successfully sell our products could adversely affect our sales. If we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of any future distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of any distribution arrangements, such distributors may fail to aggressively market our product or may terminate their relationships with us. These developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. Should we employ distributors our reliance on the sales of our products by others also makes it more difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.\nWe expect to expend significant resources to generate sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, and such efforts may not result in sales or revenue.\nGenerally, law enforcement agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase a product, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our product in addition to, or in place of other use of force products, product reliability and budget constraints. The length of our sales cycle may range from 30 days to a year or more. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our product by potential customers before they place an order. If these potential customers do not purchase our product, we will have expended significant resources without corresponding revenue.\nMost of our intended end-users are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.\nMost of our intended end-user customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore have little control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. As a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our product, it may be unable to purchase due to budgetary or political constraints. Some government agency orders may also be canceled or substantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies.\nGovernment regulation of our products may adversely affect sales.\nOur device is classified as a firearm regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms involving substantial regulatory compliance. Our device may also face state restrictions especially regarding sales to security agencies. Our product sales may be significantly affected by federal, state and local regulation. Failure to comply with regulations could also result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other actions that could adversely impact our financial position, cash flows and operating results.\nOur product is also be controlled by the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d) for exports directly from the United States. Consequently, we need to maintain our export license from the DOC for the export of our product from the United States other than to Canada. Compliance with or changes in U.S. export regulations could significantly and adversely affect any future international sales.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions may restrict the sale of our device limiting our international sales opportunities.\nOur products, including BolaWrap 100, have no issued patents or other intellectual property protection. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. None of our products, including BolaWrap 100, have any issued patented or other intellectual property protection. Our protective measures taken thus far, including pending patents, trademarks and trade secret laws, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance we will be granted any patent rights from pending patents. The scope of any possible patent rights may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. The validity and breadth of claims covered in any possible patents involve complex legal and factual questions, and the resolution of such claims may be highly uncertain, lengthy, and expensive. In addition, any patents, if granted, may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents.\nOur competitive position will be seriously damaged if our products are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOther companies and our competitors may currently own or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that might prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Any intellectual property infringement claims against us, with or without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. An adverse result from intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\ncease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nobtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u25cf\nredesign products or services that incorporate the disputed technology.\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, we could face substantial costs and shipment delays and our business could be seriously harmed. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nIn addition, it is possible that our customers may seek indemnity from us in the event that our products are found or alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claim for indemnity could result in substantial expenses to us that could harm our operating results.\nWe have no experience developing law enforcement products. Our lack of experience and competition in the law enforcement market could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nThe law enforcement market is highly competitive and our management team has no experience developing law enforcement products. We face competition from numerous larger, better capitalized, more experienced and more widely known companies that make restraint devices, less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement products. Increased competition could result in greater pricing pressure, lower gross margins and reduced sales, and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nWe cannot predict our future operating results. Our quarterly and annual results will likely be subject to fluctuations caused by many factors, any of which could result in our failure to achieve our expectations.\nWe currently expect our BolaWrap 100 product will be the source of all of any future revenues. Revenues, if any, are expected to vary significantly due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Any one or more of these factors, including those listed below, could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue expectations. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nour ability to develop and supply product to customers;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of, and changes in demand for, our products;\n\u25cf\ngains or losses of significant customers, distributors or strategic relationships;\n\u25cf\nunpredictable volume and timing of customer orders;\n\u25cf\nthe availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for our products;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs;\n\u25cf\ntiming of new technological advances, product announcements or introductions by us and by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nunpredictable warranty costs associated with our product;\n\u25cf\nbudgetary cycles and order delays by customers or production delays by us or our suppliers;\n\u25cf\nregulatory changes affecting the marketability of our products;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral political conditions in this country and in various other parts of the world that could affect spending for the products that we intend to offer.\nSome or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products and, therefore, adversely affect our future operating results. As a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the near term and accordingly you should not rely upon our performance in a particular period as indicative of our performance in any future period.\nOur expenses may vary from period to period, which could affect quarterly results and our stock price.\nIf we incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue, our results of operations will be adversely affected and we may incur larger losses than anticipated for that quarter. Factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include:\n\u25cf\nthe timing and extent of our research and development efforts;\n\u25cf\ninvestments and costs of maintaining or protecting our intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of marketing and sales efforts to promote our products and technologies; and\n\u25cf\nthe timing of personnel and consultant hiring.\nOur dependence on third-party suppliers for key components of our product could delay shipment of our products and reduce our sales.\nWe depend on certain domestic and foreign suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our product. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or subassemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and subassemblies. Specifically, we will depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, and other miscellaneous custom parts for our product. We do not have any long-term supply agreements with any planned suppliers. Any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nForeign currency fluctuations may reduce our competitiveness and sales in foreign markets.\nThe relative change in currency values creates fluctuations in product pricing for future potential international customers. These changes in foreign end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets. These changes may also negatively affect the financial condition of some foreign customers and reduce or eliminate their future orders of our products.\nLoss of key management and other personnel could impact our business.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our officers and other key personnel. The loss of an officer or any key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, competition for skilled and non-skilled employees among companies like ours is intense, and the future loss of skilled or non-skilled employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional skilled and non-skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully, develop new products, attract customers and meet customer shipments.\nInadequate internal controls and accounting practices could lead to errors, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur small size and limited personnel make maintaining internal controls and management oversight systems more challenging than for more established and larger entities. We have identified a material weakness in our accounting and financial functions due to a lack of segregation of duties primarily resulting from our limited staffing. We will need to establish and improve internal controls and management oversight systems. We may not be able to prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial statements due to system errors, the potential for human error, unauthorized actions of employees or contractors, inadequacy of controls, temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight resource contracts and other factors. In addition, due to their inherent limitations, such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under SEC rules, which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business. Controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances. It will be necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time. If we are unable to implement these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to capture and process financial transactions and support our customers as required may be materially adversely impacted, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock\nCurrently, there is no established public market for our common stock, and there can be no assurances that any established public market will ever develop or that our common stock will be quoted for trading, and even if quoted, it is likely to be subject to significant price fluctuations.\nThere has not yet been any established trading market for our common stock, and there is currently no established public market for our securities. A market maker has filed an application with FINRA on our behalf so as to be able to quote the price of our common stock on the OTC Markets commencing upon the effectiveness of certain requirements. There can be no assurance that the market maker\u2019s application will be accepted by FINRA nor can we estimate as to the time period that the application will require. We were not permitted to file such application on our own behalf. If the application is accepted, there can be no assurances as to whether:\n\u25cf\nthe prices at which our common stock will trade; or\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders for investors.\nIn addition, our common stock is unlikely to be followed by any market analysts, and there may be few institutions acting as market makers for our common stock. Either of these factors could adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of our common stock. Until an orderly market develops in our common stock, if ever, the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate significantly. Prices for our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock, developments affecting our business, including the impact of the factors referred to elsewhere in these Risk Factors, investor perception of BolaWrap 100 and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for the shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock will be subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules.\nWe expect that our common stock will be defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d are subject to Rules 15g-2 through 15g-7 and Rule 15g-9, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. Among other things, for transactions covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, these rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market. To the extent our common stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for our shares will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict the price range or volatility of our common stock, and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, the market price and volume of shares traded of companies in the industry in which we operate experience periods of significant volatility. Company-specific issues and developments generally affecting our industries or the economy may cause this volatility. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, market and political conditions;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in results of operations or results of operations that are below public market analyst and investor expectations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\noperating and market price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;\n\u25cf\npress releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our markets; and\n\u25cf\nsales of common stock or other securities by insiders.\nIn addition, broad market and industry fluctuations, investor perception and the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nSales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Many of the shares of our common stock, other than the shares held by executive officers and directors, will be eligible for immediate resale in the public market. Substantial selling of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you as to the price at which our common stock will trade following initial quotation, if any. Until our common stock is fully distributed and an orderly market develops in our common stock, the price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be lower or higher than the price that would be expected for a fully distributed issue.\nOur directors and executive officers are among our largest shareholders, and may have certain personal interests that may affect the Company.\nOur directors and executive officers owned 70.6% of our common stock at March 1, 2018. As a result, they, acting individually or as a group, have the potential ability to exert influence on the outcome of issues requiring approval by the Company\u2019s shareholders. This concentration of ownership may have effects such as delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other shareholders or preventing transactions in which shareholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nWe may issue additional common stock in the future. The issuance of additional common stock may reduce the value of your common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock without further action by our shareholders. Moreover, the economic and voting interests of each stockholder will be diluted as a result of such issuances. Although the number of shares of common stock that shareholders presently own will not decrease, such shares will represent a smaller percentage of the total shares that will be outstanding after the issuance of additional shares. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of common stock issuable on the exercise of any future options or warrants may lower the price of our common stock.\nWe adopted a stock option plan on March 31, 2017, which will authorize the grant of options or restricted stock awards to purchase up to 2.0 million shares of our common stock to our employees, directors and consultants. The issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion of options could cause substantial dilution to existing holders of common stock, and the sale of those shares in the market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The potential dilution from the issuance of these shares could negatively affect the terms on which we are able to obtain equity financing.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of your common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our shareholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Preferred stock terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.\nThe payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nThe declaration and amount of future dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors our Board deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 18322, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "WRTC"}
