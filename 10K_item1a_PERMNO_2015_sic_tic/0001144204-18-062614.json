{"cik": "1540159", "company": "Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in our common shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of net losses and limited cash flow to sustain our operations.\nWe currently have limited revenue from product sales of Stellar KLH, and anticipate our planned total operating expenses will be greater than our revenues for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $5.0 million in fiscal 2018 and $5.0 million in fiscal 2017. As of September 30, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $50.4 million since inception. To date, we have not paid dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. We have historically relied upon the sale of common shares to help fund our operations and meet our obligations. Any future additional equity financing would cause dilution to current shareholders. If we do not have sufficient capital for our operations, management would be forced to reduce or discontinue our activities, which would have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe depend heavily on the success and market acceptance of Stellar KLH and we may never recoup our investment into its research and development.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources into the development of Stellar KLH. We anticipate that in the near term our ability to generate revenues will depend solely on the commercial success of Stellar KLH, which depends upon its market acceptance by purchasers in the pharmaceutical market and the future market demand and medical need for products and research utilizing KLH. The degree of market acceptance of Stellar KLH depends on a number of factors including: the advantages and disadvantages of Stellar KLH as compared to other KLH sources and carrier molecules; our ability to educate the industry about the high quality, sustainable and traceable qualities of Stellar KLH; product efficacy; customer service; and the price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness of Stellar KLH as compared to our competitors.\nOur customers face uncertainties related to regulatory approval, which could reduce the market for our products.\nA primary market for our Stellar KLH products is its use as a component of active immunotherapies, which are currently under development. The pharmaceutical industry is subject to significant government regulation, which varies from country to country. None of the products being developed by our customers that utilize our Stellar KLH are approved for commercial sale or have been submitted in a marketing application where our KLH DMF would be reviewed by a regulatory authority. Before regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any drug is granted, it must be demonstrated through preclinical research and clinical trials to be safe and effective for its intended use in humans. The process to determine safety and efficacy, including clinical trials, is expensive, prolonged and uncertain. The time necessary to complete these processes and clinical trials, and to submit applications for regulatory approvals, is difficult to predict and is subject to numerous factors outside of our customers\u2019 control. Such clinical trials may not be successful. Larger or later stage clinical trials may not produce the same results as earlier trials. Successful results in clinical trials may not result in regulatory approval, due to certain factors including unacceptable side effects or safety issues. If our KLH is referenced in a pending marketing application or regulatory approval is granted for any drug or product that utilizes Stellar KLH, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, which include registration, manufacturing, labeling, advertising and promotion, packaging, distribution, record keeping and reporting, and storage. Because Stellar\u2019s KLH has not been part of a marketing application where our DMF was reviewed, no regulatory authority has inspected Stellar or its manufacturing operations. Manufacturing facilities, both those operated by us and by our contractors, would be subject to continual review and inspection, and failure to meet these regulatory requirements can interrupt, delay, or shut down these facilities. Previously unknown problems may result in regulatory restrictions on such products, including withdrawal from the marketplace. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for products developed by our customers that use Stellar KLH, or failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals altogether, would have a negative effect on market demand for our Stellar KLH products, and have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is geographically concentrated and if a catastrophic event, such as a hurricane, an earthquake or coastal flooding, were to impact our facilities, our business may be disrupted which could result in serious harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur aquaculture operations, research and manufacturing facilities, laboratory space, and executive offices are all located in Port Hueneme, California, a coastal city located along the Pacific Ocean. To date, we have conducted all of our aquaculture operations, research and manufacturing at these facilities and we currently have no active backup facilities or second sites. While we are investigating the establishment of additional aquaculture capabilities in Baja California, Mexico, there can be no assurance that these expansion plans will result in successful development of additional sites of research and manufacturing and KLH production outside of our Port Hueneme location. If a hurricane, an earthquake or other natural disaster, including coastal flooding, or a disease affecting our limpet colony, were to impact our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture our KLH products, which would have a serious disruptive impact on our business and a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. While we carry personal property insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses from any damage or interruption of our business operations resulting from a hurricane, an earthquake, coastal flooding or other catastrophic event.\nGovernment and geopolitical changes may impede the implementation of our strategy outside the United States.\nChanges in geopolitical policies of the United States, such as changes in U.S. support for existing treaty and trade relationships with other countries, may adversely impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with Stellar (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets (including The Nasdaq Capital Market on which our common shares are traded), and (iv) general global economic conditions. These factors are outside of our control, but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets.\nOur joint venture with Neovacs involves numerous risks that could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn May 2016, we entered into a strategic relationship with Neovacs S.A. to manufacture and sell conjugated therapeutic vaccines through a newly-formed joint venture entity in France called Neostell S.A.S. This relationship is subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. These risks include the following:\n\u00b7 our interests could diverge from those of Neovacs or we may not be able to agree on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in Neostell;\n\u00b7 we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to Neostell;\n\u00b7 we may experience difficulties and delays in manufacturing and production at Neostell;\n\u00b7 as a minority partner, our control over the operations of Neostell is limited;\n\u00b7 Neovacs may be unable to meet its commitments to us or to Neostell, which may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;\n\u00b7 due to differing business models or long-term business goals, we and Neovacs may not participate to the same extent on funding capital investments in Neostell;\n\u00b7 our working capital or cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements in Neostell;\n\u00b7 we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from Neostell and/or Neovacs due to multinational financial regulations or geopolitical forces beyond our control; and\n\u00b7 shifts in the geopolitical landscape may result in tax, legal, or regulatory changes in the United States, France and/or the European Union, thereby necessitating amendments to the agreements with Neovacs and/or the structure of the joint venture.\nIf our joint venture with Neovacs is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur expansion plans include the design and development of aquaculture infrastructure and KLH production in Mexico which presents substantial risks to our business and personnel. We may never recoup our investment into this location.\nWe are investigating the establishment of additional aquaculture capabilities in Baja California, Mexico, including research collaborations with local organizations and companies, site suitability studies, raw material sourcing and the development of regional marine resources, in anticipation of the increased demand for our KLH products, among other considerations. There are certain administrative, legal, governmental and societal risks to operating in Mexico that could adversely impact our ability to expand our operations there. Any one or more of the risks that could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our expansion and therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 geopolitical factors could adversely impact the ongoing relationship between the United States and Mexico and/or the continuity of current or future trade agreements;\n\u00b7 regional political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 ability to hire and maintain a significant work force;\n\u00b7 burdensome and evolving government regulations;\n\u00b7 cooperation of various departments of the Mexican government in issuing permits, and inspecting our operations on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 providing adequate security for our employees; and\n\u00b7 change in the value of the Mexican peso.\nIn addition, our international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the U.S. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. While we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws, our international operations create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations, significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation.\nOur sales in international markets subject us to foreign currency exchange and other risks and costs, which could harm our business.\nSubstantial portions of our revenues are derived from outside the United States; primarily from Europe and Asia. We anticipate that revenues from international customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. All our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars. However, if the effective price of our products were to increase as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, demand for our products could decline and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete with other companies in KLH production and manufacturing that may have greater resources than we do.\nThe immunotherapy industry is rapidly evolving and new competitors with competing technologies and products are regularly entering the market. Our Stellar KLH products are similar to KLH-based products produced by other companies. While we believe we are the only company that offers GMP grade KLH supported by fully traceable production methods, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We compete directly with Biosyn Corporation, a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company which manufactures KLH starting material and offers clinical and research grade KLH products. We also compete directly with SAFC, a division of Sigma-Aldrich that has historically offered clinical and research grade KLH products. Some of our competitors, both public and private, have greater financial and personnel resources than us, greater experience than us at producing products under GMP conditions suitable for later stage clinical studies, and have greater sales and marketing experience in the industry than us. If they are able to produce and sell comparable KLH products for less than us, it will have a negative effect on our operations and financial position. In addition to competition from current suppliers of KLH, we also face indirect competition from developers of other carrier molecules, adjuvants or therapeutic vaccine platforms. We are unable to predict what effect evolution of the KLH and immunotherapy industries and potential new entrants may have on price, selling strategies, intellectual property or our competitive position.\nWe may not be able to meet demand for KLH from either internally raised or ocean harvest sources.\nWe are dependent upon a supply of Giant Keyhole Limpets (Megathura crenulata) for KLH production. The range of the Giant Keyhole Limpet in the wild is limited, and due to the lack of a regulated harvest, the wild stocks of Giant Keyhole Limpets are believed to be declining. If the wild stocks are depleted, and our hatchery and aquaculture operations are unable to produce sufficient supplies of captive Giant Keyhole Limpets to meet demand, it would have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to manufacture our products in commercial quantities and currently depend on third parties for certain steps in our manufacturing operations, which could prevent us from marketing our products.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical starting materials like KLH requires significant expertise, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls that are GMP compliant. We may encounter difficulties in production or meeting GMP standards, particularly in scaling up production or transferring production to a contract manufacturing organization. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations.\nWe are currently dependent upon a small number of contractors and locations for certain steps in our manufacturing operations, and may be unable to establish and maintain relationships with qualified vendors in order to produce sufficient supplies of our finished products. We do not currently have backup manufacturing capacity for some of our key products. If we are unable to retain our current contractors, or are unable to obtain new contractors to provide manufacturing or testing services in a timely manner and on similar terms, it will have a negative effect on our operations. Further, these contract manufacturers and testing organizations provide services to many biotechnology and research companies, and such third party contractors may not provide acceptable quality, quantity or costs required by us. In addition, they may not be able to provide the services required on a schedule acceptable to us. These issues may result in us being unable to manufacture our products in the required quantities or at an acceptable cost, which would have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be in the future, significantly dependent on collaboration and supply agreements for the development and sales of Stellar KLH.\nIn conducting our research and development and commercialization activities, have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on collaboration and supply agreements with third parties, such as commercial partners, contract manufacturing organizations, contract research and testing organizations, universities, governmental agencies and not-for-profit organizations, for strategic, technological, and financial resources. The inability to secure agreements on acceptable terms, the termination of these relationships, changes in our strategy or development plans or those of third parties, or failure to perform by us or third parties who are subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks, under their respective agreements or arrangements with us, would substantially disrupt or delay our research and development and commercialization activities, including future commercial sales. Any such loss would likely increase our expenses and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe have limited marketing, sales and distribution experience and capabilities. We will need to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products.\nWe currently have limited experience in the marketing, sales and distribution of KLH products. Depending on market acceptance of our Stellar KLH products, we may need to expand our capabilities. We may not be able to establish such additional capabilities in-house, and then will need to enter into agreements with third parties to successfully perform these tasks. If we contract or make arrangements with third parties for the sales and marketing of our products, our revenues will be dependent on the efforts of these third parties, whose efforts may not be successful. If we market any of our products directly, we must either internally develop or acquire a marketing and sales force, which would require substantial resources and management attention.\nWe rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our senior management team, and we will need to hire and retain other highly skilled personnel to maintain and grow our business.\nOur ability to be successful in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical, sales and other personnel. Our performance is substantially dependent on the research and development and business development expertise of our executive officers and senior staff. We do not have employment agreements currently in effect with our executive officers, and they are free to leave their employment with us at any time.\nThere is little possibility that this dependence will decrease in the near term. The loss of the services of our executive officer, or the increased demands placed on our key executives and personnel, could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to execute our strategies. Our continued success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We may not be able to attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business.\nIn addition, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial and research personnel in all areas within our organization. We plan to grow our business and will need to hire additional personnel to support this growth. We believe that there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions, and we compete for key personnel with other biotechnology companies, as well as universities and research institutions. It is often difficult to hire and retain these persons, and we may be unable to timely replace key persons if they leave or be unable to fill new positions, as they become available, requiring key persons with appropriate experience. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to maintain and grow our business could suffer significantly.\nWe are subject to the risk of product liability claims, for which we may not have, or be able to obtain, adequate insurance coverage.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to product liability claims in the event of adverse effects, even in respect to products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale. Such claims might be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers or by pharmaceutical companies, or others selling or utilizing our Stellar KLH products. Although we currently maintain liability insurance for our products, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient and affordable insurance coverage for all claims that may occur. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, our potential inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur activities are subject to regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations, including our aquaculture and harvesting activities, are subject to regulation at the local, state and federal levels in the United States by a number of regulatory agencies including, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and similar foreign agencies. In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations related to research, manufacturing, and the commercial sales and distribution of our products, to the extent we choose to manufacture, sell or distribute any products outside of the United States. If we are unable to comply with laws and regulations in the United States and elsewhere, our operations could be restricted, or sanctions could be imposed on us, if we are found to not be in compliance with any such regulation.\nWe may face environmental risks related to handling regulated substances and hazardous materials.\nOur research and clinical development activities, as well as the manufacture of materials and products, are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and clinical development, both now and in the future, may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. In addition, in the event of an accident, applicable authorities may curtail our use of hazardous materials and interrupt our business operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property rights could result in competitive harm to our Company.\nOur success and ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, including by obtaining patent protection in the United States and other countries, or through protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information. When appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and other countries. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, whether by obtaining patents or through trade secret protection, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may not have adequate remedies for any infringement or funds to take action against those infringing any of our intellectual property rights, or if our trade secrets otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. There can be no assurance that any current or future patents held, licensed by or applied for by us will be upheld, if challenged, or that the protections afforded will not be circumvented by others. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which often involve licensing agreements, are frequently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and licensed rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. If we enter litigation in regards to our business or to protect or enforce our patents, it may involve substantial expenditures and require significant management attention, even if we ultimately prevail.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited.\nIn addition, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent application and we rely instead on confidentiality agreements and trade secret law to protect such intellectual property rights. We require all of our employees and consultants to sign confidentiality agreements. The agreements also oblige our employees, and to the extent practicable, our consultants, and advisors, to assign to us ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us. We cannot be sure that these agreements will maintain confidentiality, will prevent disclosure, or will protect our proprietary information or intellectual property, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties. This is generally referred to as having the \u201cfreedom to operate.\u201d The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings, both in the United States and internationally, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are lengthy, costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. We may become involved in protracted and expensive litigation in order to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others.\nPatent applications in the United States are, in most cases, maintained in secrecy until approximately 18 months after the patent application is filed. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patent applications relating to a product or method similar to ours may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application covering our products, methods or other claims, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding, such as an interference or derivation proceeding in the USPTO or similar proceedings in other countries, to determine the priority of invention. In the event an infringement claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay substantial legal fees and other expenses to defend such a claim and, if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim, we may be subject to injunctions or damage awards.\nIn the future, the USPTO or a foreign patent office may grant patent rights to our claims to third parties. Subject to the issuance of these future patents, the claims of which will be unknown until issued, we may need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to have the appropriate freedom to further use, develop or commercialize such products or methods. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent and do not have the freedom to operate, we could be subject to injunctions, and compelled to pay significant damages, including punitive damages, which could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nCertain of our employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, we may lose our rights to such information, in addition to paying monetary damages. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related Ownership of Our Securities\nThe price of our common shares may be subject to substantial volatility.\nAlthough our common shares are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market in the United States, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common shares will be maintained on Nasdaq, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell our common shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our shares is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common shares is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common shares.\nFurthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common shares has been in the past, and may continue in the future to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including:\n\u00b7 our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u00b7 our cash and cash equivalents position;\n\u00b7 changes in our earnings estimates;\n\u00b7 investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u00b7 our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u00b7 announcements or the expectation of raising additional financing;\n\u00b7 sales of our common shares by us, our insiders or other shareholders;\n\u00b7 the status of our listing on the Nasdaq;\n\u00b7 changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u00b7 announcements of legislative or regulatory changes in the United States and in other countries where we transact business.\nThe stock markets in general, and the small-cap biotech market, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nIf we cannot meet Nasdaq\u2019s continuing listing requirements and Nasdaq rules, Nasdaq may delist our securities, which could negatively affect our Company and the price of our securities.\nAlthough our shares are currently listed on Nasdaq, in the future, we may not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, which require, among other things, a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for common shares listed on the exchange. If we are unable to satisfy the Nasdaq criteria for maintaining our listing, our securities could be subject to delisting. Without a Nasdaq listing, shareholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our shares, the sale or purchase of our shares would likely be made more difficult, and the trading volume and liquidity of our shares could decline. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity and could make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. If our common shares are delisted by Nasdaq, our common shares may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common shares. We cannot assure you that our common shares, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the-counter quotation system.\nWe may require additional financing or financings, which would result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nWhile the Company plans to finance company operations for at least the next twelve months with cash on hand and product sales, management expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital to pursue our business plan. In addition, we may decide to expand operations, undertake strategic acquisitions or determine some other business need. Financing could include debt and/or equity financings, including transactions with strategic customers and partners that may include debt and/or equity arrangements. Such sources of financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain such financing may cause us to curtail or cease operations and/or result in delay or indefinite postponement of research and development of our Stellar KLH, expansion initiatives, capital expenditures and other operational priorities. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued common shares, or securities convertible into common shares, could result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective holders of common shares and may be on terms less favorable to us.\nWe could be deemed a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d in the future, which could have negative consequences for U.S. investors.\nWe would be designated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d, or a PFIC, under the meaning of Section 1297 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if (a) 75% or more of our gross income is \u201cpassive income\u201d (generally, dividends, interest, rents, royalties and gains from the disposition of assets producing passive income) in any taxable year, or (b) at least 50% of the average value of our assets produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. If we are designated a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. shareholder holds our common shares, it would likely result in materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for such U.S. shareholder, including, but not limited to, any gain from the sale of our common shares would be taxed as ordinary income, as opposed to capital gain, and such gain and certain distributions on our common shares would be subject to an interest charge, except in certain circumstances. In addition, U.S. shareholders should be aware that there can be no assurances that we would be able to satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a PFIC, or that we would supply U.S. shareholders with the information that such U.S. shareholders require to make certain elections available under the Code that are intended to mitigate the adverse tax consequences of the PFIC rules. The PFIC rules are extremely complex. A U.S. shareholder of our common shares is encouraged to consult a tax advisor regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common shares.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware.\nThe material differences between the British Columbia Business Corporations Act (BCBCA) as compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) which may be of most interest to shareholders include the following: (i) for material corporate transactions (such as amalgamations, other extraordinary corporate transactions, amendments to the notice of articles and amendments to the Articles), the BCBCA generally requires a two-thirds majority vote by shareholders (and, in addition, especially where the holders of a class of shares are being affected differently from others, approval will be required by holders of two-thirds of the shares of such class voting in a meeting called for that purpose), whereas the DGCL generally only requires a majority vote of shareholders for similar material corporate transactions; (ii) quorum for shareholders meetings is not prescribed under the BCBCA and is 33-1/3% under our Articles (to assure compliance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements); whereas, under the DGCL, quorum requires the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote to be present; and (iii) our Articles require a two-thirds majority vote of shareholders to pass a resolution for one or more directors to be removed, whereas the DGCL requires only the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders. Accordingly, certain provisions of our corporate governance under the laws of British Columbia may be disadvantageous to our shareholders.\nRisks Related to an Emerging Growth and Smaller Reporting Company\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (EGC) as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act), and as a result, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We will remain an EGC until the expiration of this status as provided by the JOBS Act or we meet other criteria. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. As EGC we are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley requirements that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, certain executive compensation and discussion reporting requirements and certain other reduced disclosure obligations with respect to our SEC filings. We have elected not to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nIf we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in future filings, the information that we provide our security holders may be different than information such security holders might receive from other public companies in which they hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we cannot be certain if such reduced disclosure will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act, and are thus allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations with respect to our SEC filings. We will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day our recently completed second fiscal quarter is over $250 million or we have over $100 million in annual revenues. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 15854, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EDSA"}
