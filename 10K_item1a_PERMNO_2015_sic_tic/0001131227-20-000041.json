{"cik": "1131227", "company": "HORNBECK OFFSHORE SERVICES INC /LA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information we have provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. You should also consider the factors contained in our \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d disclaimer found on page ii of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nContinued Risk Upon Plan Confirmation and Effectiveness.\nDespite the confirmation of our Plan by the Bankruptcy Court on June 19, 2020, there is no guarantee that any chapter 11 plan of reorganization, including the Plan, will achieve our stated goals. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced global demand for oil. Moreover oil supply increased temporarily as a result of the inability of Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach agreement on production cuts. The consequence was a sharp drop in oil prices, which adversely affected the demand for our services. There is significant uncertainty surrounding when and by how much oil prices will recover, and whether that recovery will result in increased demand for our services. Thus, even if our debts are reduced and/or discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our businesses after the completion of the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nFurthermore, even after the Plan is confirmed and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy protection.\nWe Will Be Subject to the Risks and Uncertainties Associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, our ability to operate, develop, and execute a business plan, and continue as a going concern, will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include the following: (a) ability to consummate the restructuring transactions specified in the Plan; (b) ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time; (c) ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, vendors, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties; (d) ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations; and (e) ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our businesses and operations in various ways. For example, negative events associated with the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we will need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that occur during the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nOperating in Bankruptcy for a Long Period of Time May Harm Our Businesses.\nDespite the Bankruptcy Court having confirmed our Plan, our emergence is dependent upon certain governmental regulatory approvals over which we have little control as to the timing or outcome. Until these conditions are met, or waived our emergence will be delayed. Delay in emergence could itself have an adverse effect on our businesses. The longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that customers, employees and suppliers may lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and could seek to establish alternative commercial relationships. A lengthy bankruptcy proceeding also would involve additional expenses and divert the attention of management from the operation of our businesses.\nSo long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, we may be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases. If the chapter 11 proceedings last longer than anticipated, we will require additional debtor-in-possession financing to fund our operations. If we are unable obtain such financing in those circumstances, the chances of successfully reorganizing our businesses may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we will instead be required to liquidate or sell our assets may be increased, and, as a result, creditor recoveries under the Plan may be significantly impaired.\nA Default Under the DIP Loan Could Adversely Impact the Confirmed Plan.\nThe DIP Loan contains various covenants and other obligations with which we must comply during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases. If we were to default under the DIP Loans, we would be deemed to be in default of the Plan, which could adversely impact our ability to proceed with the Plan.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses.\nWe May Not Be Able to Generate Sufficient Cash to Service All of Our Indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or refinance our debt obligations, including the DIP financing and the Exit Facilities depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry, and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest and/or fees on our indebtedness, including, without limitation, anticipated borrowings under the Exit Facilities upon emergence.\nFinancial Results May Be Volatile and May Not Reflect Historical Trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect that our financial results will continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and/or claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance likely will not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance after the Petition Date.\nIn addition, if we emerge from chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt \u201cfresh start\u201d accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 852 (\u201cReorganizations\u201d) in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical margin trends.\nOur Substantial Liquidity Needs May Impact Revenue.\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry. Our liquidity, including the ability to meet ongoing operational obligations, will be dependent upon, among other things: (a) our ability to comply with the terms and condition of the DIP Loan and the Exit Financings; (b) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand; (c) our ability to generate cash flow from operations; (d) our ability to consummate the Plan; and (e) the cost, duration, and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity depends, in part, upon industry conditions and general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. In the event that cash on hand and cash flow from operations are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may be required to seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered to us on acceptable terms. Our access to financing in addition to the Exit Financings is, and for the foreseeable future likely will continue to be, extremely limited if it is available at all. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nWe Derive Substantial Revenues from Companies in the Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production Industry, A Historically Cyclical Industry with Levels of Activity That Are Directly Affected by the Levels and Volatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices.\nThe demand for our services from companies in various energy-related industries, particularly the oil and gas exploration and production industry, has traditionally been cyclical, depending primarily on the capital expenditures of oil and gas exploration and production companies. These capital expenditures are influenced by such factors as:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, including the economic impacts of the COVID-19 virus;\n\u2022\nthe action of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls, including the anticipated increases in supply from Russia and OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia;\n\u2022\nprevailing oil and natural gas prices, particularly with respect to prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering hydrocarbons;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of available offshore leases;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate, size and location of new hydrocarbon reserves, including in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nthe rate of decline of existing hydrocarbon reserves due to production;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change;\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources and end-user conservation trends;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances, including technology related to the exploitation of shale oil; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil & gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures.\nPrices for oil and natural gas have historically been, and we anticipate it will continue to be, extremely volatile and reactive to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas (including changes resulting from the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to establish and maintain production quotas), domestic and worldwide economic conditions and political instability in oil producing countries. Material declines in oil and natural gas prices have affected, and will likely continue to affect, the demand for and pricing of our services. In response to currently prevailing industry conditions, many oil and gas exploration and production companies and other energy companies have made significant reductions in their capital expenditure budgets over the past three years. In particular, some of our customers have reduced their spending on exploration, development and production programs, and have decreased their rig counts in the geographic areas in which we operate. Low oil prices have adversely affected demand for our services and further decreases, over a sustained period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations and operating cash flows depend on our obtaining significant contracts, primarily from companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. The timing of or failure to obtain contracts, delays in awards of contracts, cancellations of contracts, delays in completion of contracts, or failure to obtain timely payments from our customers, could result in significant periodic fluctuations in our results of operations and operating cash flows. If customers do not proceed with the completion of significant projects or if significant defaults on customer payment obligations to us arises, or if we encounter disputes with customers involving such payment obligations, we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us, including for costs we previously incurred.\nImpairment of Our Long-Term Assets May Adversely Impact Our Financial Position and Results of Operations.\nWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, and intangible assets. In performing these assessments, we project future cash flows on an undiscounted basis for long-lived assets and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our property and equipment and intangibles whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. In such event, if we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results are materially different from what we have predicted, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe Waiver or Repeal of the Jones Act Could Adversely Impact our Business.\nSubstantial portions of our operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and thus subject to the provisions of the Jones Act which, subject to limited exceptions, restricts maritime transportation between points in the United States (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels that are: (a) built in the United States; (b) registered under the U.S. flag; (c) manned by predominantly U.S. crews; and (d) owned and operated by U.S. Citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. For years, there have been attempts to repeal or amend such provisions, and such attempts are expected to continue in the future. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may waive the requirement for using U.S.-flag vessels with coastwise endorsements in the U.S. coastwise trade in the interest of national defense. Furthermore, the Jones Act restrictions on the maritime cabotage services are subject to certain exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the North American Free Trade Agreement. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag, foreign-built vessels or foreign-owned vessels. Repeal, substantial amendment or waiver of provisions of the Jones Act could significantly adversely affect us by, among other things, resulting in additional competition from competitors with lower operating costs, because of their ability to use vessels built in lower-cost foreign shipyards, owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than U.S. Citizens. Because foreign vessels may have lower construction costs and operate at significantly lower costs than companies operating in the U.S. coastwise trade, such a change could significantly increase competition in the U.S. coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe Must Continue to Comply With the Jones Act\u2019s Citizenship Requirements.\nBecause we own and operate U.S.-flagged vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade, the Jones Act requires that at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of the capital stock of the Company must be owned and controlled by U.S. Citizens. We are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our equity securities and subsidiaries to ensure compliance with the citizenship requirements of the Jones Act. After the Effective Date, if we do not continue to comply with such requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our U.S.-flagged vessels in U.S. coastwise trade and may incur severe penalties, such as fines and/or forfeiture of such vessels and/or permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges for such vessels.\nThe Plan contemplates the holders of the first-lien term loans, second-lien term loans, the 2020 Senior Notes and the 2021 Senior Notes receiving equity in consideration of amounts due, as well as the purchase by certain of such holders of new common stock in the Rights Offering. Because certain holders of the first-lien term loans, second-lien term loans, 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes and such purchasers are not U.S. Citizens, the Company is requesting authorization from the United States Coast Guard and the U.S. Maritime Administration for approval prior to the Effective Date to issue Jones Act Warrants in lieu of common stock to the extent foreign ownership would otherwise exceed 24% of the Company\u2019s new common stock in order to ensure compliance with the Jones Act citizenship requirement. New Jones Act Warrants may only be exercised by (i) U.S. Citizens, and (ii) Non-U.S. Citizens to the extent such exercise would not cause more than 24% foreign ownership of our new common stock. The New Jones Act Warrant Agreement will not grant the holder of a New Jones Act Warrant any voting or control rights or dividend rights, or contain any negative covenants\nrestricting the operation of our business. While the United States Coast Guard and the U.S. Maritime Administration have authorized similar arrangements previously, there is no guarantee that our proposal will be approved or that subsequently the ownership structure is deemed invalid. In addition, there is a risk that new common stock held could be sold to a non-U.S. Citizen inadvertently resulting in the 25% foreign ownership limitation being violated, which could jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to continue to engage in U.S. coastwise trade.\nOur Operations May Be Impacted By Changing Macroeconomic Conditions and the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 could have a significant impact on our business by reducing demand for offshore support services. Sustained reductions in worldwide economic growth and economic activity could ultimately lead to a global recession. In a global recession, it is likely that the demand for oil and natural gas would decline and the number of planned offshore drilling projects would decrease. Such a scenario would negatively impact the demand for offshore support services, and in turn, our financial performance. In addition, mandatory quarantines or drill site shutdowns enacted by the government or self-imposed by our customers could limit or reduce offshore drilling production. Significant contractions in offshore drilling production could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur Business is Subject to Complex Laws and Regulations That Can Adversely Affect the Cost, Manner, or Feasibility of Doing Business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including complex environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with such regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or accidental spills or releases of oil and hazardous substances may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. In the event of environmental violations or accidental spills or releases, we may be charged with the costs of remediation and land owners may file claims for alternative water supplies, property damage, or bodily injury. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may, in some circumstances, result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault. In addition, pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. These liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we operate our vessels in a number of international markets and are subject to various international treaties and the local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and/or are registered. These conventions, laws and regulations govern matters of environmental protection, worker health and safety, vessel and port security, and the manning, construction, ownership and operation of vessels, including cabotage requirements similar to the Jones Act. Changes in such international treaties and such local laws and regulations can be unpredictable and may adversely affect our ability to carry out operations overseas.\nWe Operate in a Highly Competitive Industry.\nThe offshore drilling support industry is both highly competitive and capital-intensive, and requires substantial resources and investment to satisfy customers and maintain profitability. Our customers award contracts based on price, industry reputation, service quality, vessel offerings and capabilities, transit costs, and other similar factors. Though we operate a best-in-class fleet of OSVs and MPSVs and have a proven track record, increased competition for deepwater drilling contracts could depress day rates and utilization rates, adversely affecting our profitability. A sustained inability to win contracts in our key markets would put pressure on our ability to service our debt.\nThe Loss of Key Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Relationship with the Military.\nThe ongoing viability and potential growth of our contractual relationship with the Military is dependent on our continued employment of certain key personnel. Any action taken by the Military in response to the loss of key personnel, or potential loss of key personnel, from our operations could adversely affect our current and future business with the military and, in turn, adversely affect our financials, as applicable.\nWe May Be Adversely Affected by Potential Litigation, Including Litigation Arising Out of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIn the future, we may become parties to litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their Claims under the Plan. It is not possible to predict the potential litigation that we may become party to nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on our businesses and financial stability, however, could be material.\nCertain Claims Will Not Be Discharged and Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all Claims that arise prior to the filing of our Petitions or before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (a) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and/or (b) would be discharged in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization. In order to achieve its objective of a swift confirmation of the Plan, the Company determined to leave many classes of claims as unimpaired and thus such claims are not discharged under the Plan. Holders of such claims can still assert the claims against the reorganized entity and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Loss of Key Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the efforts and continued employment of our executive officers and key management personnel. Our recent liquidity issues and the Chapter 11 Cases have created distractions and uncertainty for key management personnel and employees. Given the prolonged down-turn that has affected the offshore oil services sector, coupled with industry management turnover resulting from restructurings and other corporate changes, seasoned managers are in demand. The loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or key management personnel could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnstacking of Vessels Could Adversely Impact the Market for OSVs.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had stacked 35 U.S.-flagged OSVs and nine foreign-flagged OSVs. To the extent that we unstack any vessels in response to improvement or perceived improvement in market conditions faster than the market can absorb such additional vessels, the market for OSVs could become oversaturated and would adversely affect dayrates and utilization for our vessels.\nAs a Result of the Declines in Oil Prices that Began in Late 2014, Our Customers Have Reduced and May Further Reduce Spending on Exploration and Production Projects, Resulting in a Decrease in Demand for Our Services.\nOil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly impact the level of worldwide drilling and production services activities. Reduced demand for oil and natural gas or periods of surplus oil and natural gas generally result in lower prices for these commodities and often impact the economics of planned drilling projects and ongoing production projects, resulting in the curtailment, reduction, delay or postponement of such projects for an indeterminate period of time. When drilling and production activity and related spending declines, both vessel dayrates and utilization for our vessels historically decline as well. This has been the case, beginning in October 2014 and continuing into 2020.\nOil prices worldwide dropped significantly commencing in 2014. While prices have partially recovered, we cannot predict whether current prices are sustainable. Further we do not know whether current prices will result in increased offshore and/or deepwater capital spending by our customers.\nA continuation of the prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect us by negatively impacting:\n\u2022\nour revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022\nthe fair market value of our vessels;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain capital to refinance our existing debt or expand our business through newbuilds, acquisitions, or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe collectability of our receivables; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain or rehire skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.\nIf any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in the Supply of Vessels Could Decrease Dayrates.\nBoth us, through our fifth OSV newbuild program, and certain of our competitors have announced plans to construct and deploy new vessels. An influx of U.S.-flagged vessels currently operating in other regions or in non-oilfield applications into the GoM would result in an increase in vessel capacity in the GoM, one of our core markets. Similarly, vessel capacity in foreign markets, including Mexico and Brazil (our other core markets), may also be impacted by U.S.-flagged or other vessels migrating to such foreign locations. Further, any modification to the Jones Act that would permit foreign-flagged, foreign-built, foreign-owned, foreign-controlled or foreign-operated vessels to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade would also increase vessel capacity in our core markets. Any increase in the supply of OSVs or MPSVs, whether through new construction, refurbishment, or conversion of vessels from other uses, remobilization, or changes in law or its application could increase competition for charters, lower utilization, or lower dayrates, any of which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Such an increase in vessel capacity could also exacerbate the impact of the current oil downturn, or any future downturn in the oil and gas industry, which would have an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, because the Jones Act does not cover certain services provided by MPSVs, foreign competitors may deploy additional MPSVs to the GoM or build additional MPSVs that will compete with us in the GoM.\nThe Early Termination of Contracts for our Vessels Could Have an Adverse Effect on our Operations.\nCertain contracts for our vessels, including contracts with the United States government, allow for early termination at the customer\u2019s option. Many of our contracts that contain early termination provisions contain remedies or other provisions designed to discourage customers from exercising such options. Customers may choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or provisions. Until we replace the terminated contracts with new contracts, our business could be temporarily disrupted or adversely affected. Further, we may not be able to replace the terminated contracts on economically equivalent terms due to market or industry conditions.\nAdditionally, in economic downturns, customers have requested that we adjust the terms of their contracts to be more customer-friendly, including by assuming greater risks. While we are not required to give such concessions, commercial considerations may dictate that we do so, given the relatively few deepwater customers operating in the GoM.\nWe May Not Be Able to Complete the Construction of Our Remaining Newbuild Program and May Experience Delays or Cost Overruns Related to the Newbuild Program if Construction is Resumed.\nWe previously began constructing the last two MPSVs under our pending newbuild program. These vessels are large and complex. We estimate that the cost to complete these vessels could exceed the $57.5 million budgeted for their completion. We are engaged in litigation with sureties regarding performance and payments bonds that, if honored, are expected to cover the full cost to completion. Additionally, ongoing litigation with the shipyard contracted to build the vessels and with the surety has halted construction and, to the extent we resume construction, unforeseen events could result in significant cost overruns for which, under certain circumstances, we might be responsible.\nFailure to Successfully Complete Repairs, Maintenance and Routine Drydockings On-time and On-budget Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Operations.\nWe routinely engage shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance, repair, and maintenance. Equipment shortages, insufficient shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering issues, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals, material shortages, labor issues, and other similar factors could lead to extended delays or additional costs. Significant delays could\nadversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, and significant cost overruns could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nFuture Acquisitions by Us May Create Additional Risks.\nWe regularly consider possible acquisitions of single vessels, vessel fleets, and businesses. Acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and attention from existing business and other business opportunities;\n\u2022\ndelays in closing the acquisition due to third-party consents, regulatory approvals, or other reasons;\n\u2022\nadverse effects from disclosed or undisclosed matters pertaining to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nloss or termination of employees and the costs associated with the termination or replacement of such employees;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of debt, litigation, or other liabilities of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional debt related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\ncosts, expenses, and working capital requirements associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nregulatory costs associated with, among others, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n\u2022\naccounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense.\nEven if we consummate an acquisition, the process of integrating the new acquisition into our operations may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and additional costs, and may adversely affect the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. Newly acquired vessels may need to be immediately stacked due to market conditions, resulting in additional stacking and un-stacking costs that could act as a barrier to their deployment if our liquidity position deteriorates. The foregoing risks, and other similar risks, of an acquisition could affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of utilization, profitability, or other benefits from the acquisitions. An inability to acquire additional vessels or businesses may adversely affect our growth.\nOur Contracts with the United States Government Could Be Adversely Affected by Budget Cuts or Government \u201cShutdowns.\u201d\nOur contracts with the United States Government depend upon annual funding commitments authorized by Congress. In a period of government budget cuts or other political events, such as a prolonged government shutdown, such contracts might not be re-authorized or might be temporarily suspended, adversely affecting our financials.\nOur Business Involves a Number of Operational Risks That May Disrupt Our Business, Adversely Affect Our Financials, and Insurance May Be Unavailable or Inadequate to Protect Against Such Risks.\nOur vessels are subject to operating risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncatastrophic marine disaster;\n\u2022\nadverse weather and sea conditions;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure;\n\u2022\ncollisions or allisions;\n\u2022\noil or other hazardous substance spills;\n\u2022\nnavigational errors;\n\u2022\nacts of God; and\n\u2022\nwar or terrorism.\nThe occurrence of any of the enumerated events, or other similar events, may result in vessel damage, vessel loss, personnel injury or death, or environmental contamination. The occurrence of any such event could expose us to liability or costs that we would be required to pay before seeking repayment from our insurers.\nAffected vessels may also be removed from service and thus be unavailable for income-generating activity. While we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate and insures against risks that are customary in the industry, we may\nbe unable to renew such coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Moreover, existing or future coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may arise and we do not maintain insurance for loss of income resulting from a marine casualty.\nOur Operations in International Markets and Shipyard Activities in Foreign Shipyards Subjects us to Risks Inherent in Conducting Business Internationally.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from foreign sources. In addition, certain of our shipyard repair and procurement activities are being conducted with foreign vendors. We therefore face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, such as legal and governmental regulatory requirements, potential vessel detentions, seizures or nationalization of assets, import-export quotas or other trade barriers, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, political and economic instability, kidnapping of or assault on personnel, piracy, adverse tax consequences, difficulties and costs of staffing international operations and language and cultural differences. We do not hedge against foreign currency risk. While we endeavor to contract in U.S. Dollars when operating internationally, some contracts may be denominated in a foreign currency, which would result in a foreign currency exposure risk. All of these risks are beyond our control and difficult to insure against. We cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. If such an event should occur, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe May Be Unable To Attract And Retain Qualified, Skilled Employees Necessary To Operate Our Business.\nMuch of our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Our inability to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain, and grow our business.\nIn crewing our vessels, we require skilled employees who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the recent volatility in the oil and gas industry, we have significantly reduced our crew headcount. Additionally, as a result of such volatility, vessel employees and potential employees may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with those we offer. In normal market conditions, we face strong competition within the broader oilfield industry for employees and potential employees, including competition from drilling rig operators for fleet personnel. We may have difficulty hiring employees or finding suitable replacements as needed and, once normal market conditions return, should a reduced pool of workers arise, it is possible that we would have to raise wage rates or increase benefits offered to attract workers and to retain current employees. In such circumstances, if we are unable to increase our service rates to customers to compensate for wage increases or recruit qualified personnel to operate vessels at full utilization, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur Employees Are Covered by Federal Laws That May Subject Us to Job-related Claims in Addition to Those Provided by State Laws.\nProvisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and general maritime law cover certain of our employees. These laws preempt state workers\u2019 compensation laws and permit employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job-related tort claims in federal courts. Because we are generally not protected by the damage limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes for these types of claims, we may be exposed to higher damage awards for these types of claims.\nWe Are Susceptible to Unexpected Increases in Operating Expenses such as Crew Wages, Materials and Supplies, Maintenance and Repairs, and Insurance Costs.\nMany of our operating costs, such as crew wages, materials and supplies, maintenance and repairs, and insurance costs are unpredictable and vary based on events beyond our control. Our profitability will vary based on fluctuations in operating costs. If our operating costs increase, we may not be able to recover such costs from customers. Such an increase in operating costs could adversely affect our financials.\nStacked Vessels May Introduce Additional Operational Issues.\nDue to difficult market conditions, we elected to stack certain vessels in our fleet at various points in the last several years. We also reduced the number of crew and personnel that operate and maintain such vessels. Though vessel stacking reduces the costs of operating a vessel, it reduces the number of available vessels we can deploy to service our customers and limits potential revenues. If market conditions do not improve, we may be required to stack additional vessels.\nWhen we elect to unstack the stacked vessels, we will incur regulatory recertification and remobilization costs and may incur additional costs to hire and train personnel to operate the vessels. Such costs could have an adverse effect on our financials and operations.\nWe May Be Unable to Collect Amounts Owed to Us by Customers.\nWe typically grant customers credit on a short-term basis. Because we do not typically collect collateralized receivables from customers, we are subject to credit risk on the credit we extend. We estimate uncollectible accounts in our financial statements based on historical losses, current economic conditions, and individual customer evaluations. However, our estimates may not be accurate and the receivables due from customers as reflected in our financial statements may not be collectible. In addition, the continued adverse effect of the combination of COVID-19 and the ongoing oil price war initiated by Russia and Saudi Arabia on the macro supply-demand equation for commodity prices is expected to result in a greater than usual number of oil and gas and oilfield service companies being at risk of bankruptcy, which could exacerbate our revenue collection efforts.\nThe Plan Will Result in the Cancellation of Our Common Stock and Satisfaction of Our Other Publicly Traded Securities.\nUnder the Plan, all of our existing equity interest will be extinguished and our other publicly traded securities will be satisfied. Amounts invested by the holders of our common stock will not be recoverable and our common stock will have no value.", "PERMNO": 90067, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "HOSSQ"}
