{"cik": "1425565", "company": "Real Goods Solar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nWe wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives. These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware. Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results. Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Industry\nThe reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.\nU.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning. The federal government currently offers a 30% investment tax credit under Section 48(a)(3) and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Federal ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until\nDecember 31, 2016. This credit is due to decline to 10% for business income taxpayers and to expire for personal income tax payers in 2017. In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives. The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.\nWe prepare and submit paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing partners to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentives. The failure to complete this paperwork accurately or submit it on a timely basis may reduce our revenue and profit on projects and expose us to liquidated damages and other penalties\nWe typically prepare and submit the necessary paperwork on behalf of our customers and financing companies to obtain payment for solar energy systems that we sell and applicable incentive payments. The processing of such paperwork is generally subject to rigid and formal compliance procedures. In addition, such processing may be time consuming and add significant cost and administrative burden. We may price our products assuming that we will obtain payments that depend on the timely and accurate processing of such paperwork. There can be no assurance that we will be able to process necessary paperwork in a timely and accurate manner and successfully obtain all payments available to us or to our customers. If we are unsuccessful in doing so, our revenue and profit margin will be negatively impacted and we may have to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages.\nOur business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.\nThe solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development. The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain. If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets. In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate. Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:\n\u2022\navailability of government and utility company subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar energy industry;\n\u2022\ngovernment and utility policies regarding the interconnection of solar energy systems to the utility grid;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as changes in the price of natural gas and other fossil fuels;\n\u2022\ncost-effectiveness (including the cost of solar panels), performance and reliability of solar energy systems compared with conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u2022\nsuccess of other renewable energy generation technologies, such as hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, solar thermal, concentrated solar and biomass;\n\u2022\navailability of financing with economically attractive terms;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in expenditures by purchasers of solar energy systems, which tend to decrease in slower economic environments and periods of rising interest rates and tighter credit; and\n\u2022\nderegulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.\nA drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.\nThe demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nExisting rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.\nThe market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering, which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility\u2019s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site. In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed. Metering caps currently exist in certain jurisdictions, which limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the electric grid. Some utilities also restrict the amount of consumer-owned electricity generation that can be placed on a circuit and the may require special studies or equipment before such generation can be connected to the utility grid. These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems, deter purchases of solar energy systems and require investment in the research and development of solar energy technology. For example, in 2013 and 2014, Hawaiian Electric, the electric utility on Oahu, imposed new rules and procedures for the interconnection of solar systems on circuits with a high penetration of customer-owned electricity generation. These new rules and procedures have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of on-site solar energy systems being sold or interconnected in Oahu in 2014. Similar actions by utilities in other markets could have a similar effect. In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed. Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require solar energy systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity. Such changes are under consideration in markets in which we operate, such as California.\nExisting regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.\nThe installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations. We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards. Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems. In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.\nFor projects where we recognize revenue on system installations on a percentage-of-completion basis or payments are due upon the achievement of contractual milestones, any delay or cancellation of a project could adversely affect our business.\nFor projects where we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis and, as a result, our revenue from these installations is driven by the performance of our contractual obligations. The time it takes to execute our contractual obligations may impact the amount of revenue recognized in a particular period. Timelines can be adversely impacted by weather, governmental agencies, utilities and customer requirements. In addition, certain customer contracts may include payment milestones due at specified points during a project. Although we generally build payment terms that provide for positive cash flow, delays in project execution or customer payments can adversely affect our business and cash flows.\nOur sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.\nOur sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems. We experience spikes in orders in the Spring and Summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the Summer and Fall. Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and the tax appetite of customers. Our ability to construct systems outdoors can be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year. As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year. If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and cash flow.\nOur inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.\nThe solar energy industry is subject to technological change. If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share. In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.\nWe derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, Hawaii and California.\nWe currently derive the vast majority of our revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states, California and Hawaii. This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified. The growth of our business will require us to expand our operations in existing markets and to commence operations in other states. Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.\nWe have identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting\nOur independent auditor audited our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the first time, in connection with the year ended December 31, 2014 and identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. This could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny, additional costs to remediate and potentially an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, if we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial results or prevent fraud from occurring.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability. If our revenue levels decrease or if we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $146.7 million as of December 31, 2014. If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.\nWe may require significant additional funds, the amount of which will depend upon our working capital and general corporate needs, and be unable to obtain necessary funding.\nOur operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to operate or expand our business and adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us. If our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our offering of units of our Class A common stock and warrants in February 2015, the \u201c2015 offering\u201d, are insufficient to meet our obligations, we could be required to sell additional equity securities or refinance our obligations and may be unable to do so.\nCompetitors with superior access to capital may have a significant advantage over us if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain adequate and timely financing for expansion and acquisitions.\nThe solar installation industry is highly fragmented and continues to move toward consolidation. We compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have greater capital resources than we have. If we do not have available capital, for example, as a result of our inability to produce cash flow or obtain financing on acceptable terms, when acquisition opportunities arise, may preclude us from competing for available acquisition opportunities.\nOur present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing; and we may experience adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations\nThere can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, future financings or other sources to meet our debt service obligations, cash requirements to fund operations or other liquidity needs. Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing without restructuring the covenants in our existing indebtedness to permit the incurrence of such financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be used for payments on the debt and related interest, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to respond to changing business, industry and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates or in the event of refinancing existing debt at higher interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make investments, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the general economy and restricting us from making improvements or acquisitions or exploring business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt or greater resources; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.\nOur future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our failure to meet our debt service obligations or pay our indebtedness when it comes due may cause us to become insolvent, which would cast doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.\nOur indebtedness imposes various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries. The restrictions that are imposed under these debt instruments include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nchange our business, management or ownership;\n\u2022\nengage in any merger, acquisition or consolidation transactions;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake dividends or distributions and repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake payments on or amend any subordinated obligations\nOur ability to comply with the covenants imposed by the terms of our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with such covenants, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.\nOur failure to realize cost savings from restructuring and optimization could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn an attempt to realize efficiencies and cost savings, we are in the process of restructuring and optimizing our business. We may be unable to effectively complete such restructuring and optimization efforts. Furthermore, we may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives. Our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expenses, and our efforts may lead to additional unintended consequences. As a result, our restructuring and optimization efforts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel. The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.\nOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us. We do not carry key man life insurance on our executives. If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior executive and management personnel or attract additional qualified senior executive and management personnel.\nThe loss of or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.\nThe expansion of our business could place a significant strain on our managerial, financial and personnel resources. To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems. While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel. The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Litigation claims have also been made against us by investors in our July 2014 private placement. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nWe rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers and vendors, to some of which we owe significant past due balances, and if these suppliers and vendors become unwilling to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our solar energy systems. We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications. The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results. There have been times in our history when we have had significant outstanding balances and have been in arrears with many of our suppliers and vendors. When these circumstances existed, many of these suppliers and vendors were no longer willing to provide products or services to us, and placed us on \u201ccredit hold\u201d, or were requiring payment in advance. If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply. We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply. If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.\nAlthough currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted companies such as us. Shortages in the supply of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.\nShortages of silicon, inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules we use in our solar energy systems. Manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic modules. The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, primarily because of demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry. Shortages of silicon cause the prices for solar photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain. While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future. Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.\nA substantial portion of the solar photovoltaic modules used in the United States are sourced from foreign suppliers and rules and conditions affecting international trade can have an adverse effect on the supply of solar photovoltaic modules and their cost.\nA significant percentage of PV modules used in the United States are imported from China or utilize solar cells made in Taiwan. In 2014 the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs on these products. Although most of the solar photovoltaic modules we used in 2014 were sourced from domestic manufacturers, we experienced price increases and occasional problems with availability as a result of these tariffs. Other international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.\nWe install solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.\nThese factors include:\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor;\n\u2022\nunforeseen installation scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems;\n\u2022\nissues at the job site that were not apparent during site inspection; natural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, fires, earthquakes or other casualty losses or delays;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining or inability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses or permits;\n\u2022\nchanges to plans or specifications;\n\u2022\nperformance by subcontractors;\n\u2022\ndisputes with subcontractors; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.\nOur installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects. For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.\nBecause the solar energy system installation market is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.\nThe solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry. We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers. Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital, but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe availability of proprietary solar financing solutions;\n\u2022\nthe price at which competitors offer comparable products;\n\u2022\nmarketing efforts undertaken by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe extent of our competitors\u2019 responsiveness to customer needs;\n\u2022\naccess to financing for solar energy systems;\n\u2022\naccess to proprietary materials or systems.\nCompetition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry. Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel. Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.\nSolar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous. Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects. Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and also maintains insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.\nAvailability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.\nMany of our customers depend on loan or lease financing to fund the purchase price our solar energy systems. The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions. Third-party financing sources also charge significant fees for their financing products. If our financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, our customers\u2019 cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue. In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease and we will experience lower profit margins. In 2014 we introduced our own financing option in selective markets. However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance the majority of our sales of solar energy systems.\nOur failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers\u2019 homes and businesses could give rise to claims against us.\nOur failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us. In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.\nAs a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries. Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.\nWe may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.\nAs a result of the length of the warranty periods we provide both in workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system. Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defects in material and workmanship. In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance. Although we maintain a warranty reserve for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our reserve could adversely affect our operating results. Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.\nAn increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.\nSome of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans, or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system. Third-party financing sources specifically for solar energy systems are currently limited. The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or more costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.\nWe must meet The NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing requirements or we risk delisting, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our shareholders to trade our stock.\nOur Class A common stock is currently listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market. We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements or risk delisting of our securities. Delisting would have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock and likely also on our business. As previously disclosed, on December 15, 2014, we received notice from NASDAQ that we were not in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid-price rule. We have 180 calendar days, or until June 15, 2015, to regain compliance. If we have not regained compliance by that date, and if certain conditions are met, we may be eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period. Further, on February 13, 2015, we publicly disclosed that, due to an impairment charge for the fourth quarter of 2014, as reported we have negative shareholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2014, which would also constitute a violation of the NASDAQ continuing listing requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements, or that our Class A common stock will not be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market in the future. If our Class A common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, it may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market. In such case, our shareholders\u2019 ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of, shares of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities.\nWe expect to hold a special meeting of our shareholders on May 12, 2015 to consider and seek approval of a reverse stock split which if approved we expect will (i) cause our stock price to meet the NASDAQ minimum bid price continued listing requirement and (ii) cause us to have a sufficient number of shares of Class A common stock available for future warrant exercises. There can be no assurance our shareholders will approve the reverse stock split.\nIn the event the make-up of our board of directors or audit committee were not, or are not in the future, in compliance with the SEC and NASDAQ independence requirements, we face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our shareholders and our business.\nThe SEC rules and the NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s continued listing requirements require, among other things, that a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent and that our audit committee consists entirely of independent directors. In the event that we do not remain in compliance with these requirements, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without the requisite independent review and approval. This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our shareholders generally and our executive officers, shareholders, or directors.\nFurther, our failure to comply with these requirements may limit the quality of the decisions that are made by our board of directors and audit committee, increasing the risk of material misstatements or omissions caused by errors or fraud with respect to our financial statements or other disclosures that may occur and not be detected in a timely manner or at all, or the payment of inappropriate levels of\ncompensation to our executive officers. In the event that there are deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may misreport our financial results or lose significant amounts due to misstatements caused by errors or fraud. Finally, if the composition of our board of directors or audit committee fails to meet NASDAQ\u2019s independence requirements in the future, our Class A common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Securities\nThe market price of the Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of the Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating results;\n\u2022\nregulatory, legislative or other developments affecting us or the solar energy industry generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations relating to our services and products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions and trends within the solar energy industry;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022\nintroductions of new technological innovations, services, products or pricing policies by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nvolume and timing of customer orders;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor perception;\n\u2022\nthe level and quality of any research analyst coverage of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022\nthe financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or its failure to meet such guidance;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of the Class A common stock or the sale of such stock by Riverside Renewable Energy Investments LLC (\u201cRiverside\u201d) or its management team or directors;\n\u2022\nour issuance of additional shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock; and\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and industries. These fluctuations may include a so-called \u201cbubble market\u201d in which investors temporarily raise the price of the stocks of companies in certain industries, such as the renewable energy industry, to unsustainable levels. These market fluctuations may significantly affect the market price of the Class A common stock.\nFuture issuances of our stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of the Class A common stock.\nOwnership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities. Our recently completed 2015 Offering includes warrants to purchase more than 30 million shares of our Class A common stock based on our current expectations. The number of shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants increases when the price of our Class A common stock declines.\nThe Warrants issued in the 2015 Offering require us to send instructions to our transfer agent within one trading day of receipt of an exercise notice, and require us to deliver the number of shares of our Class A common stock requested within three trading days of receipt of the exercise notice, provided that we have received the exercise price for such shares. The exercise price of the warrant shares may be significantly less than the market price of our Class A common stock at the time of exercise. If we are unable to deliver the shares of Class A common stock within the timeframe required, we may be obligated to reimburse the holder for the cost of purchasing the shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or pay them the profit they would have realized upon the exercise and sale of such shares. We are also obligated to pay the holder in cash if we do not have sufficient shares of our Class A common stock available to fulfill an exercise notice.\nIn addition, as of March 23 , 2015, there were an aggregate of approximately 55.1 million shares of Class A common stock that may be issued upon exercise or conversion of other outstanding options to purchase our Class A common stock under our 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan and warrants or other agreements.\nWe also have two effective shelf registration statements, one covering approximately $5.0 million aggregate offering price of securities, and another covering approximately $182.8 million aggregate offering price of securities, under which we may issue additional securities in the future (in each case, all of which could be issued as shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of Class A common stock). Derivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount. For example, the warrants we issued in the June 3, 2013 private placement provide that among other things, if we issue or sell, or are deemed to have issued and sold, shares of Class A common stock for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced and the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be increased, based on the formula and on the terms set forth in the warrants. The warrants issued in our 2015 Offering also contains anti-dilution protection reducing the exercise price but not directly increasing the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. However, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B warrants issued in our 2015 Offering is calculated by dividing a stated dollar value by an exercise price. As a result, if the exercise price is reduced, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series B warrants increases.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nSecurities analysts may not continue to cover our Class A common stock, and this may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our stock is downgraded by a securities analyst, our stock price would likely decline. If the analyst ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors in our securities would have to sell some or all of their stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Any determination to pay dividends in the future on the Class A common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nOur business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources.\nBecause our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in our management that our shareholders may believe advantageous. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may consist of any number of directors, which may be fixed from time to time by our board of directors. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in our authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by an election at an annual meeting or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancies on its board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining board of directors, even if less than a quorum is remaining in office.\n\u2022\nA shareholder must provide advance notice of any proposal to be brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, including any nomination for election of directors by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting.\n\u2022\nNo shareholder proposal may be considered at a meeting of our shareholders unless the proposal relates to a matter on which a shareholder vote is required by our articles of incorporation, bylaws or by applicable law.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors has the power to issue preferred stock with designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights determined by our board of directors without any vote or action by shareholders. The issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire our company.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may amend, supplement or repeal our bylaws or adopt new bylaws, subject to repeal or change by action of our shareholders.\nRisk Factors Related to our Relationship with Gaiam and Riverside\nRiverside has influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other shareholders.\nRiverside holds approximately 15% of the currently outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. Riverside\u2019s ownership may increase, stay the same or decrease depending on the amount of shares of Class A common stock we issue in the future. Further, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Riverside currently has the right to designate two individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors. Because of Riverside\u2019s voting rights and its ability to designate individuals for appointment or nomination to our board of directors, Riverside will be able to exert influence over our company and matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, financing activities, a merger or sale of our assets and the number of shares authorized for issuance under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nAccordingly, shares of our Class A common stock may be worth less than they would be if Riverside did not maintain voting significance over us. Riverside is not prohibited from selling a significant interest in our company to a third party and may do so without shareholder approval and without providing for a purchase of other shares of our Class A common stock.\nOur historical financial information as a business conducted by Gaiam may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.\nOur historical financial information for periods when Gaiam controlled us does not reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the historical periods presented. The historical costs and expenses reflected in our consolidated financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Gaiam, including costs of fulfillment, systems, finance and other administrative services, and income taxes. These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Gaiam considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us. The historical financial information in our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, or what they will be in the future. We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that occurred in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Gaiam, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as audit fees, directors and officers insurance costs and compliance costs.\nPossible future sales of shares by Riverside could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, even if our business is doing well.\nRiverside may sell any or all of the shares of Class A common stock owned by it from time to time for any reason. Under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement between Riverside and us, entered into in connection with the closing of the Alteris merger, Riverside has the right to require us to register the shares of Class A common stock that it owns to facilitate the possible sale of such shares. Although we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of Class A common stock by Riverside would have on the market price prevailing from time to time, sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock or the availability of such shares for sale could adversely affect prevailing market prices.", "PERMNO": 92687, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "RGSEQ"}
