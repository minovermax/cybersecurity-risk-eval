RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in analyzing an investment in our common stock. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties not known to us currently, or that may appear immaterial, also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements, whether made in this annual report or future quarterly reports to stockholders, press releases, or oral statements, whether in presentations, responses to questions, or otherwise.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have substantial outstanding indebtedness, and our outstanding indebtedness could adversely impact our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing, our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial debt and, as a result, we have significant debt service obligations. On May 31, 2015, we entered into a $950.0 million Term Loan, a $150.0 million U.S. ABL, and a $150.0 million Asia ABL. We drew $80.0 million of the U.S. ABL at the closing of the acquisition of Viasystems. In addition, we and a number of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have various credit, letters of credit and guarantee facilities. The agreements governing these facilities have certain provisions that require us to repay borrowings in scheduled quarterly installments, which began on October 1, 2015. We may also be required to make an additional principal payment on an annual basis, based on certain parameters defined these agreements. For 2015, we are required to make an additional annual payment of $61.1 million, which is required to be paid in March 2016. Such agreements also contain certain financial covenants which require us to maintain a specified consolidated leverage ratio and under the occurrence of certain events, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to us and our shareholders because in certain circumstances we may need to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing such indebtedness and dedicate funds to service our outstanding debt. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments or general corporate purposes, which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\ndiminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business, the industry in which we operate or the economy generally and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or the general economy;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including movements in interest rates, which could result in increased borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt as it could limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures or adverse changes.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some or all of which may be secured by a lien on our assets. If new debt or other liabilities or obligations are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain regulatory, competitive, financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments or to sell assets, seek additional capital (which could include obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive) or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our operating results and available cash may in the future be insufficient to meet our debt service obligations. We could face substantial liquidity challenges and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or, if consummated, the proceeds of such dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nWe have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of other businesses and may encounter risks associated with these activities, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOn May 31, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of Viasystems. This transaction and any other acquisitions we may pursue in the future involve numerous risks. As part of our business strategy, we expect that we will continue to grow by pursuing acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets, or product lines that complement or expand our business. Risks related to an acquisition may include:\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale, or other expected value;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our existing business to focus on integration of the newly acquired business;\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses associated with the integration of the newly acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing production and coordinating operations at new sites;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to retain existing customers of acquired companies when we desire to do so;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential decrease in overall gross margins associated with acquiring a business with a different product mix;\n\u2022\nthe inability to identify certain unrecorded liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to restructure, modify, or terminate customer relationships of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nan increased concentration of business from existing or new customers; and\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to identify assets best suited to our business plan.\nAcquisitions may cause us to:\n\u2022\nenter lines of business and/or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022\nissue debt and be required to abide by stringent loan covenants;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities; record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nbecome subject to litigation and environmental issues, which include product material content certifications related to conflict minerals;\n\u2022\nincur unanticipated costs;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs; and\n\u2022\nincur substantial transaction-related costs, whether or not a proposed acquisition is consummated.\nAcquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions will be successful. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion. In addition, unforeseen issues might arise with respect to such products after any such acquisition.\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the economy and financial markets could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nUncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could lead to a significant decline in demand for the end products manufactured by our customers, which, in turn, could result in a decline in the demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. As a result of the recent global economic downturn, many businesses appear to be experiencing weaker demand for their products and services and, as a result, are taking a more conservative stance in ordering component inventory. Any decrease in demand for our products could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the cost and decrease the availability of potential sources of financing and increase our exposure to losses from bad debts, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our restructuring efforts.\nIn our Form 8-K filed on September 29, 2015, we announced restructuring plans that are designed to align capacity, overhead costs and operating expenses with market demand. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring efforts within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions, and may vary materially based on factors such as market conditions and the effect of our restructuring efforts on our work force. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our current or future restructuring efforts. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve the cost savings expected from such restructurings, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the acquisition of Viasystems or may incur additional costs because of integration difficulties and other challenges, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn May 31, 2015, we closed our acquisition of Viasystems. The success of the acquisition of Viasystems will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate Viasystems\u2019 business with our existing business and achieve efficiencies and cost savings, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so. For example, costs\nassociated with Viasystems\u2019 legal proceedings and other loss contingencies may be greater than expected. In addition, in order to obtain the benefits of the acquisition of Viasystems, we must integrate Viasystems\u2019 operations. Such integration may be complex, and the failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect earnings. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Viasystems\u2019 business include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain customers;\n\u2022\noperating, competitive and market risks inherent in Viasystems\u2019 business and our business;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the acquisition of Viasystems on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nAlthough we expect to realize strategic, operational, and financial benefits as a result of the acquisition of Viasystems, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, such benefits will be achieved in the future. We may not accomplish the integration of Viasystems\u2019 business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated cost range or timeframe. The diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our current operations to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of Viasystems and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have identified $55 million in annual cost savings, which are expected to be implemented within the first 12 months following the consummation of the acquisition of Viasystems. While our management believes these cost savings are achievable, our ability to achieve such estimated cost savings in the timeframe described is subject to various assumptions by management, which may or may not be realized. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize all of these cost savings within the time frame expected or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost savings.\nWe are subject to risks of currency fluctuations.\nA portion of our cash and other current assets is held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of December 28, 2015, we had an aggregate of approximately $217.4 million in current assets denominated in Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD). Changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the value of these assets as translated to U.S. dollars on our balance sheet. To the extent that we ultimately decide to repatriate some portion of these funds to the United States, the actual value transferred could be impacted by movements in exchange rates. Any such type of movement could negatively impact the amount of cash available to fund operations or to repay debt. To the extent that we may have outstanding indebtedness denominated in the U.S. dollar or in the HKD, the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar or the HKD may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations (including the cost of servicing, and the value on our balance sheet of, the U.S. dollar and HKD-denominated indebtedness). Additionally, we have revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the RMB). Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the RMB could result in increases or decreases in our costs or revenues which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Significant inflation or disproportionate changes in foreign exchange rates could occur as a result of general economic conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, or changes in local interest rates. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the RMB and the U.S. dollar and the HKD cannot be predicted. Further, China\u2019s government imposes controls over the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies, which subjects us to further currency exchange risk.\nProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us.\nWe manufacture products to our customers\u2019 specifications, which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures, despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a design, manufacturing, or materials failure or error, may result in delayed shipments, customer dissatisfaction, a reduction or cancellation of purchase orders, or liability claims against us. If these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may be impaired. Since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers\u2019 businesses, errors, defects, or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers beyond the cost of the PCB, for which we may be liable. Although our invoices and sales arrangements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability and related claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions. See \u201c- We depend upon a relatively small number of OEM customers for a large portion of our sales, and a decline in sales to major customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d\nIn addition, we manufacture products for a range of automotive customers. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of such products. As suppliers become more integral to the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. In addition, vehicle manufacturers, which have traditionally borne the costs associated with warranty programs offered on their vehicles, are increasingly requiring suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and may seek to hold us responsible for some or all of the costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied by us to the vehicle manufacturer.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the worldwide electronics industry, which is characterized by economic cycles and fluctuations in product demand. A downturn in the electronics industry or prolonged global economic crisis could result in decreased demand for our manufacturing services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from the electronics industry, which is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. The industry is subject to economic cycles and recessionary periods. Due to the uncertainty in the end markets served by most of our customers, we have a low level of visibility with respect to future financial results. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings, and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings, and cash flows.\nWe depend upon a relatively small number of OEM customers for a large portion of our sales, and a decline in sales to major customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion of our sales. Our five largest OEM customers accounted for approximately 37%, 44% and 41% of our net sales for the years ended December 28, 2015, December 29, 2014 and December 30, 2013, respectively, and one customer represented 20% of our sales for the year ended December 28, 2015. Sales attributed to OEMs include both direct sales as well as sales that the OEMs place through EMS providers. Our customer concentration could fluctuate, depending on future customer requirements, which will depend in large part on market conditions in the electronics industry segments in which our customers participate. The loss of one or more significant customers or a decline in sales to our significant customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, during industry downturns, we may need to reduce prices to limit the level of order losses, and we may be unable to collect payments from our customers. There can be no assurance that key customers would\nnot cancel orders, that they would continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as experienced by us in prior periods, that they would be able to meet their payment obligations, or that the end-products that use our products would be successful. This concentration of customer base may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations due to the loss or cancellation of business from any of these key customers, significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers, or decreases in the prices of the products sold to any of these customers.\nIf we are unable to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization rates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nGiven the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance gross margins will continue to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory capacity utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization will depend on the demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements at competitive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands, our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve expected gross margins. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long-lived assets change in the future, significant impairment charges could result that would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we generally schedule our quick turnaround production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities and lay off some of our employees. Closures or lay-offs could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance, other exit costs, and asset impairments, as well as potentially causing disruptions in our ability to supply customers.\nOur results of operations are often subject to demand fluctuations and seasonality. With a high level of fixed operating costs, even small revenue shortfalls would decrease our gross margins.\nOur results of operations fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of orders from and shipments to major customers;\n\u2022\nthe levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nprice competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in our mix of revenues generated from quick-turn versus standard delivery time services;\n\u2022\nexpenditures, charges or write-offs, including those related to acquisitions, facility restructurings, or asset impairments; and\n\u2022\nexpenses relating to expanding existing manufacturing facilities.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our gross margins. In addition, we have experienced sales fluctuations due to seasonal patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles, as well as inventory management practices of our customers and the end markets we serve. In particular, the seasonality of the cellular phone and tablet industries and quick-turn ordering patterns affect the overall PCB industry. These seasonal trends have caused fluctuations in our operating results in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nWe rely on the telecommunications industry for a significant portion of sales. Accordingly, the economic volatility in this industry has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to forecast demand and production and to meet desired sales levels.\nA large percentage of our business is conducted with customers who are in the telecommunications industry. This industry is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. This industry is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of those markets. If the volatility in this industry continues, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results can be adversely affected by rising labor costs.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to rising labor costs, particularly within China, where we have most of our manufacturing facilities. In recent periods there have been regular and significant increases in the minimum wage payable in various provinces of China. In addition, we have experienced very high employee turnover in our manufacturing facilities in China, generally after the Chinese New Year, and we are experiencing ongoing difficulty in recruiting employees for these facilities. Furthermore, labor disputes and strikes based partly on wages have in the past slowed or stopped production by certain manufacturers in China. In some cases, employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants. Any increase in labor costs due to minimum wage laws or customer requirements about scheduling and overtime that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the high turnover rate and our difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and the other labor trends we are noting in China could result in a potential for defects in our products, production disruptions or delays, or the inability to ramp production to meet increased customer orders, resulting in order cancellation or imposition of customer penalties if we are unable to deliver products in a timely manner.\nTo respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, we may further expand internationally in lower-cost locations. If we pursue such expansions, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures. In addition, the cost structure in certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop or as such countries join multinational economic communities or organizations, causing local wages to rise. As a result, we may need to continue to seek new locations with lower costs and the employee and infrastructure base to support PCB manufacturing. We cannot assure investors that we will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of our international operations or that our international operations will contribute positively to our operating results.\nIn our North America operations, rising health care costs pose a significant labor-related risk. We work with our insurance brokers and carriers to control the cost of health care for our employees. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will succeed, especially given recent and pending changes in government oversight of health care.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be materially adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries and states with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, as well as other factors. Our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities, and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our net earnings do not remain at or above recent levels, or we are not able to predict with a reasonable degree of probability that they will continue, we may have to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets.\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries have deferred income tax assets. Based on our forecast for future taxable earnings for these foreign subsidiaries, we believe we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods. However, if our estimates of future earnings decline, we may have to increase our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, resulting in a higher income tax provision, which would reduce our cash flows.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Viasystems, our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have increased. If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we would be required to record a material, non-cash charge to earnings, which would also reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs of December 28, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $497.9 million of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred, such that the potential for reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with further decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization may indicate that the remaining balance of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that assets are impaired, we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, which could harm our results during the periods in which such a reduction is recognized.\nWe will perform our fiscal year 2016 annual impairment test during our fourth fiscal quarter. Given the recent volatility of our market capitalization, it is reasonably possible that we could record an impairment charge by fiscal year end when we conduct our annual impairment test.\nEmployee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of engineering and manufacturing personnel. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees, primarily in China, may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages. Any of these events could be disruptive to our operations and could result in negative publicity, loss of contracts, and a decrease in revenues. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees or segments of our workforce become unionized, including any of our employees in the United States. We have not experienced any labor problems resulting in a work stoppage, except for a brief work stoppage associated with the announcement of the closure of our Suzhou, China facility in September 2013.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets.\nMost of our sales are on an \u201copen credit\u201d basis, with standard industry payment terms. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. During periods of economic downturn in the electronics industry and the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, such programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks.\nOur five largest OEM customers accounted for approximately 37%, 44% and 41% of our net sales for the years ended December 28, 2015, December 29, 2014 and December 30, 2013, respectively. Additionally, our OEM customers often direct a significant portion of their purchases through a relatively limited number of EMS companies. Sales to EMS companies represented approximately 35%, 39% and 38% of our net sales for the years ended December 28, 2015, December 29, 2014 and December 30, 2013, respectively. Our contractual relationship is often with the EMS companies, who are obligated to pay us for our products. Because we expect\nour OEM customers to continue to direct our sales to EMS companies, we expect to continue to be subject to this credit risk with a limited number of EMS customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on suppliers for the timely delivery of raw materials and components used in manufacturing our PCBs and E-M Solutions. If a raw material supplier fails to satisfy our product quality standards, it could harm our customer relationships.\nAlthough we have preferred suppliers for most of our raw materials, the materials we use are generally readily available in the open market, and other potential suppliers exist. The components for backplane assemblies in some cases have limited or sole sources of supply. Consolidations and restructuring in our supplier base may result in adverse materials pricing due to reduction in competition among our suppliers. Furthermore, if a raw material or component supplier fails to satisfy our product quality standards, including standards relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (See \u201c- We are subject to risks for the use of certain metals from \u201cconflict minerals\u201d originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u201d), it could harm our customer relationships. Suppliers may from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors, which could harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.\nWe serve customers and have manufacturing facilities outside the United States and are subject to the risks characteristic of international operations.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations in Asia and sales offices located in Asia and Europe, and we continue to consider additional opportunities to make foreign investments and construct new foreign facilities.\nFor the year ended December 28, 2015, we generated 71% of our net sales from non-U.S. operations, and a significant portion of our manufacturing material was provided by international suppliers during this period. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to significant international operations, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmanaging international operations;\n\u2022\nimposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\nunstable regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ncompliance with employment laws;\n\u2022\nimplementation of disclosure controls, internal controls, financial reporting systems, and governance standards to comply with U.S. accounting and securities laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on imports or exports of our product offerings;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of local currencies;\n\u2022\ninflation or changes in political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest, rising wages, difficulties in staffing, and geographical labor shortages;\n\u2022\ngovernment or political unrest;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nlanguage and communication barriers, as well as time zone differences;\n\u2022\ncultural differences;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties and taxation levied on our products;\n\u2022\nother potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ntravel restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of private enterprises; and\n\u2022\nthe potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment and trade.\nOur operations in China subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of China.\nUnder its current leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization. No assurance can be given, however, that the government of China will continue to pursue such policies, that such policies will be successful if pursued, or that such policies will not be significantly altered from time to time. Despite progress in developing its legal system, China does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws, particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade. Enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and implementation and interpretation thereof may be inconsistent. As the Chinese legal system develops, the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws, and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. Further, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. In addition, though changes in government policies and rules are timely published or communicated, there is usually no indication of the duration of any grace period before which full implementation and compliance will be required. As a result, we may operate our business in violation of new rules and policies before full compliance can be achieved. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us.\nWe depend on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business, which involves unique risks. Changes in government defense spending or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from products and services ultimately sold to the U.S. government by our OEM and EMS customers and is therefore affected by, among other things, the federal budget process. We are a supplier, primarily as a subcontractor, to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. The contracts between our direct customers and the government end user are subject to political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the government\u2019s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks, such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.\nFor the year ended December 28, 2015, aerospace and defense sales accounted for approximately 14% of our total net sales. The substantial majority of these sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. While we do not sell any significant volume of products directly to the U.S. government, we are a supplier to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. Consequently, our sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments and may be affected by federal budget sequestration measures.\nThe domestic and international threat of terrorist activity, emerging nuclear states, and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense products and services and homeland security solutions in the recent past. The U.S. government, however, is facing unprecedented budgeting constraints. The termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture changes to the Munitions List could reduce or eliminate restrictions that currently apply to some of the products we produce. If these regulations or others are changed in a manner that reduces restrictions on products being manufactured overseas, we would likely face an increase in the number of competitors and increased price competition from overseas manufacturers, who are restricted by the current export laws from manufacturing products for U.S. defense systems.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. government.\nA facility security clearance is required in order to be awarded and perform on classified contracts for the DoD and certain other agencies of the U.S. government. As a cleared entity, we must comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations. Further, due to the fact that a significant portion of our voting equity is owned by a non-U.S. entity, we are required to be governed by and operate in accordance with the terms and requirements of the Special Security Agreement (the SSA). The terms of the SSA have been previously disclosed in our SEC filings.\nIf we were to violate the terms and requirements of the SSA, the NISPOM, or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations (which may apply to us under the terms of classified contracts), we could lose our security clearance. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform on classified contracts and would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe participate in the competitive automotive industry, which has strict quality control standards.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Viasystems, a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry. If there was a destabilization of the automotive industry or a market shift away from our automotive customers, it may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, for safety reasons, automotive customers have strict quality standards that generally exceed the quality requirements of other customers. If such products do not meet these quality standards, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These automotive customers may require long periods of time to evaluate whether our manufacturing processes and facilities meet their quality standards. If we were to lose automotive customers due to quality control issues, we might not be able to regain those customers or gain new automotive customers for long periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, we may be required under our contracts with automotive industry customers to indemnify them for the cost of warranties and recalls relating to our products.\nCompetition in the PCB market is intense, and we could lose market share if we are unable to maintain our current competitive position in end markets using our quick-turn, high technology, and high-mix manufacturing services.\nThe PCB industry is intensely competitive, highly fragmented, and rapidly changing. We expect competition to continue, which could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include AT & S Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik AG, Chin Poon Industrial Co., LTD., Compeq Manufacturing Co., Ltd., IBIDEN Co., Ltd., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Multek Corporation, Sanmina Corporation, Tripod Technology Corp., Unimicron Technology Corp., and Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd. Our principal E-M Solutions competitors include Amphenol Corp, Flex, Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Sanmina Corporation. In addition, we increasingly compete on an international basis, and new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our markets.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and manufacturing resources that can be devoted to the development, production, and sale of their products;\n\u2022\nmore established and broader sales and marketing channels;\n\u2022\nmore manufacturing facilities worldwide, some of which are closer in proximity to OEMs;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing facilities that are located in countries with lower production costs;\n\u2022\nlower capacity utilization, which in peak market conditions can result in shorter lead times to customers;\n\u2022\nability to add additional capacity faster or more efficiently;\n\u2022\npreferred vendor status with existing and potential customers;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition; and\n\u2022\nlarger customer bases.\nIn addition, these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements than we do. We must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers\u2019 needs for complex products, and our manufacturing process technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. During recessionary periods in the electronics industry, our strategy of providing quick-turn services, an integrated manufacturing solution, and responsive customer service may take on reduced importance to our customers. As a result, we may need to compete more on the basis of price, which would cause our gross margins to decline.\nIf we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to manufacture products that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. We expect that the investment necessary to maintain our technological position will increase as customers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis. For example, in 2016 we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our HDI and other advanced manufacturing capabilities. We may not be able to obtain access to additional sources of funds in order to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors.\nIn addition, the PCB industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete. We may not respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market. If we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive, the development, acquisition, and implementation of those technologies and equipment will require us to make significant capital investments.\nAn increase in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and reduce our gross margins.\nTo manufacture PCBs, we use raw materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass, copper foil, chemical solutions, gold, and other commodity products, which we order from our suppliers. In the case of backplane assemblies, components include connectors, sheet metal, capacitors, resistors and diodes, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers\u2019 approved vendors. If raw material and component prices increase, it may reduce our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to provide our customers with high-end technology, high-quality products, and responsive service, or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain our existing customer base and obtain business from new customers, we must demonstrate our ability to produce our products at the level of technology, quality, responsiveness of service, timeliness of delivery, and cost that our customers require. If our products are of substandard quality, if they are not delivered on time, if we are not responsive to our customers\u2019 demands, or if we cannot meet our customers\u2019 technological requirements, our reputation as a reliable supplier of our products would likely be damaged. If we are unable to meet anticipated product and service standards, we may be unable to obtain new contracts or keep our existing customers, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks for the use of certain metals from \u201cconflict minerals\u201d originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nDuring the third quarter of 2012, the SEC adopted rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). These rules impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries as required by Dodd-Frank. While these new rules continue to be the subject of ongoing litigation and, as a result, uncertainty, we submitted a conflict minerals report on Form SD with the SEC on June 2, 2014 and May 14, 2015. Compliance with these rules is likely to result in additional costs and expenses, including costs and expenses incurred for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the costs and expenses of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification efforts. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our PCBs, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may, at a minimum, face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.\nDamage to our manufacturing facilities due to fire, natural disaster, or other events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe destruction or closure of any of our facilities for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, blizzard, act of war or terrorism, flood, tornado, earthquake, lightning, other natural disasters, an outbreak of epidemics such as Ebola or severe acute respiratory syndrome, required maintenance, or other events could harm us financially, increasing our costs of doing business and limiting our ability to deliver our manufacturing services on a timely basis.\nOur insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers\u2019 products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.\nIn the event one or more of our facilities is closed on a temporary or permanent basis as a result of a natural disaster, required maintenance or other event, or in the event that an outbreak of a serious epidemic results in quarantines, temporary closures of offices or manufacturing facilities, travel restrictions or the temporary or permanent loss of key personnel, our operations could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production or repair, rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities. This time frame could be lengthy and result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. While we have disaster recovery plans in place, there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every natural or man-made disaster, pandemic, required repair or other extraordinary event. Any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation as a reliable supplier.\nWe face constant pricing pressure from our customers and competitors, which may decrease our profit margins.\nCompetition in the PCB market is intense, and we expect that competition will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. We and some of our competitors have reduced average selling prices in the past. In addition, competitors may reduce their average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs, which can also accelerate the rate of decline of our selling prices. When prices decline, we may also be required to write down the value of our inventory.\nThe effects of such pricing pressures on our business may be exacerbated by inflationary pressures that affect our costs of supply. When we are unable to extract comparable concessions from our suppliers on prices they charge us, this in turn reduces gross profit if we are unable to raise prices. Further, uncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could also lead to a significant decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. As a result of the recent global economic downturn, many businesses have taken a more conservative stance in ordering inventory. Any decrease in demand for our products, coupled with pressure from the market and our customers to decrease our prices, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe pricing pressure we face on our products requires us to introduce new and more advanced technology products to maintain average selling prices or reduce any declines in average selling prices. As we shift production to more advanced, higher-density PCBs, we tend to make significant investments in plants and other capital equipment and incur higher costs of production, which may not be recovered.\nThe prominence of EMS companies as our customers could reduce our gross margins, potential sales, and customers.\nSales to EMS companies represented approximately 35%, 39% and 38% of our net sales for the years ended December 28, 2015, December 29, 2014 and December 30, 2013, respectively. Sales to EMS providers include sales directed by OEMs as well as orders placed with us at the EMS providers\u2019 discretion. EMS providers source on a global basis to a greater extent than OEMs. The growth of EMS providers increases the purchasing power of such providers and has in the past, and could in the future, result in increased price competition or the loss of existing OEM customers. In addition, some EMS providers, including some of our customers, have the ability to directly manufacture PCBs and create backplane assemblies. If a significant number of our other EMS customers were to acquire these abilities, our customer base might shrink, and our sales might decline substantially. Moreover, if any of our OEM customers outsource the production of PCBs and creation of backplane assemblies to these EMS providers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in the scope and complexity of our operations. This growth may strain our managerial, financial, manufacturing, and other resources. In order to manage our growth, we may be required to continue to implement additional operating and financial controls and hire and train additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations. In addition, growth in our capacity could result in reduced capacity utilization and a corresponding decrease in gross margins.\nOur international sales are subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt practices, trade, and export controls and economic sanctions. Any non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate on a global basis and are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to government officials or any other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate and sell our products in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We also, from time to time, undertake business ventures with state-owned companies or enterprises.\nOur global business operations must also comply with all applicable domestic and foreign export control laws, including International Traffic In Arms Regulations (ITAR), and Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Some items we manufacture are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security under EAR.\nWe train our employees concerning anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and compliance with international regulations regarding trades and exports, and we have policies in place that prohibit employees from making improper payments. We cannot provide assurances that our internal controls and procedures will guarantee compliance by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-kickback laws in international jurisdictions or for violations of ITAR, EAR, or other similar regulations regarding trades and exports, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the inadvertence of others, we could suffer criminal or civil fines or penalties or other repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur global business operations also must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations, such as laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Department of Commerce. We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including criminal or civil fines or penalties, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business.\nIn certain countries, we may engage third-party agents or intermediaries, such as customs agents, to act on our behalf, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in criminal or civil fines or penalties or other sanctions being assessed against us. We take certain measures designed to ensure our compliance with U.S. export and economic sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws and regulations, and export control laws. However, it is possible that some of our products were sold or will be sold to distributors or other parties, without our knowledge or consent, in violation of applicable law. There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance in the future. Any such violation could result in significant criminal or civil fines, penalties, or other sanctions and repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in litigation, fines, revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes, or debarment from our participation in federal government contracts.\nOur operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, as well as analogous state, local, and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because our manufacturing processes use and generate materials classified as hazardous. Because we use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing processes, we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of our own sites, or sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated. Even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination, we may still be liable. The wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal and cupric etching solutions, metal stripping solutions, waste acid solutions, waste alkaline cleaners, waste oil, and waste waters that contain heavy metals such as copper, tin, lead, nickel, gold, silver, cyanide, and fluoride, and both filter cake and spent ion exchange resins from equipment used for on-site waste treatment.\nEnvironmental law violations, including the failure to maintain required environmental permits, could subject us to fines, penalties, and other sanctions, including the revocation of our effluent discharge permits. This could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail, environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend.\nEnvironmental laws have generally become more stringent and this trend may continue over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations, and we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation to another global location where prohibitive regulations do not exist. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly required to certify compliance with various material content restrictions in our products based on laws of various jurisdictions or territories such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directives in the European Union and China\u2019s RoHS legislation. Similar laws have been adopted in other jurisdictions and may become increasingly prevalent. In addition, we must also certify as to the non-applicability of the EU\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive for certain products that we manufacture. The REACH directive requires the identification of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) periodically. We must survey our supply chain and certify to the non-presence or presence of SVHCs to our customers. As with other types of product certifications that we routinely provide, we may incur liability and pay damages if our products do not conform to our certifications.\nWe are also subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in China, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The manufacturing of our products generates gaseous chemical wastes, liquid wastes, waste water, and other industrial wastes from various stages of the manufacturing process. Production sites in China are subject to regulation and periodic monitoring by the relevant environmental protection authorities. Environmental claims or the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production, or cessation of operations.\nThe process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to city, county, state, federal, and foreign environmental regulations regarding the storage, use, handling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes, and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards and chemical use reporting. In China, governmental authorities have adopted new rules and regulations governing environmental issues. An update to Chinese environmental waste water law was issued in late 2012, allowing for an interim period in which plants subject to such law may install equipment that meets the new regulatory regime. Our plants in China are not yet in full compliance with the newly adopted environmental regulations. There can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future.\nEmployee theft or fraud could result in loss.\nCertain of our employees have access to, or signature authority with respect to, bank accounts or other company assets, which could expose us to fraud or theft. In addition, certain employees have access to certain precious metals used in connection with our manufacturing and key information technology (IT) infrastructure and to customer and other information that is commercially valuable. Should any employee, for any reason, steal any such precious metals (which has occurred from time to time), compromise our IT systems, or misappropriate customer or other information, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers against us, and the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged. Additionally, in the case of our defense business, we could be debarred from future participation in government programs. Any such losses may not be fully covered by insurance.\nBecause we sell on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our customers that could decrease revenues and harm our operating results.\nAlthough we have long-term contracts with many customers, those contracts generally do not contain volume commitments. We generally sell to customers on a purchase order basis. Our quick-turn orders are subject to particularly short lead times. Consequently, our sales are subject to short-term variability in demand by our customers. Customers submitting purchase orders may cancel, reduce, or delay their orders for a variety of reasons, subject to negotiations. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers may vary due to:\n\u2022\ncustomer attempts to manage inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 manufacturing strategies, such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of PCB manufacturers or backplane assembly service providers used or to manufacture or assemble its own products internally;\n\u2022\nvariation in demand for our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nchanges in new product introductions.\nWe have periodically experienced terminations, reductions, and delays in our customers\u2019 orders. Further terminations, reductions, or delays in our customers\u2019 orders could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them that have restrictive terms and conditions. These agreements typically include provisions that increase our financial exposure, which could result in significant costs to us.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them. These agreements typically do not include volume commitments, but do include provisions that generally serve to increase our exposure for product liability and limited sales returns, which could result in higher costs to us as a result of such claims. In addition, these agreements typically contain provisions that seek to limit our operational and pricing flexibility and extend payment terms, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their PCB manufacturing and backplane assembly needs to us. If OEMs choose to provide these services in-house or select other providers, our business could suffer.\nOur future revenue growth partially depends on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers. They also evaluate the potential benefits of manufacturing their products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other providers, our financial results and future growth could be materially adversely affected.\nConsolidation among our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRecently, some of our large customers have consolidated, and further consolidation of customers may occur. Depending on which organization becomes the controller of the supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred or approved supplier. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently support. While there is potential for increasing our position with the combined customer, there does exist the potential for decreased revenue if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. We also face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to fund investments in our operations, refinance our indebtedness, and to maintain and grow our business, and such capital may not be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur business is capital-intensive, and our ability to increase revenue, profit, and cash flow depends upon continued capital spending. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations are insufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings. If we are unable to fund our operations and make capital expenditures as currently planned or if we do not have sufficient liquidity to service the interest and principal payments on our debt, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we do not achieve our expected operating results, we would need to reallocate our sources and uses of operating cash flows. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business. Looking ahead at long-term needs, we may need to raise additional funds for a number of purposes, including the following:\n\u2022\nto fund capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity, upgrade and expand our technological capabilities and replace aging equipment or introduce new products;\n\u2022\nto refinance our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nto fund our operations beyond 2016;\n\u2022\nto fund working capital requirements for future growth that we may experience;\n\u2022\nto enhance or expand the range of services we offer;\n\u2022\nto increase our sales and marketing activities; or\n\u2022\nto respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition, and international expansion activities.\nShould we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our current debt instruments. There can be no assurance that additional capital, including any future equity or debt financing, would be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. If such funds are not available to us when required or on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations could be materially adversely affected by a shortage of utilities or a discontinuation of priority supply status offered for such utilities.\nThe manufacturing of PCBs requires significant quantities of electricity and water. Our Asia Pacific operations have historically purchased substantially all of the electrical power for their manufacturing plants in China from local power plants. Because China\u2019s economy has recently been in a state of growth, the strain on the nation\u2019s power plants is increasing, which has led to continuing power outages in various parts of the country. There may be times when our operations in China may be unable to obtain adequate sources of electricity to meet production requirements. Various regions in China have in the past experienced shortages of both electricity and water and unexpected interruptions of power supply. From time to time, the Chinese government rations electrical power, which can lead to unscheduled production interruptions at our manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, certain of the areas in which our North America operations have manufacturing facilities, particularly in California, have experienced power and resource shortages from time to time, including mandatory periods without electrical power, changes to water availability, and significant increases in utility and resource costs. California has also recently experienced drought conditions, prompting the Governor of California to proclaim a Drought State of Emergency. Due to the severe drought conditions, some local and regional water districts and the state government are implementing policies or regulations that restrict water usage and increase the cost of water.\nWe do not generally maintain any back-up power generation facilities or reserves of water for our operations, so if we were to lose supplies of power or water at any of our facilities, we would be required to cease\noperations until such supply was restored. Any resulting cessation of operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, thus potentially resulting in a loss of business, along with increased costs of manufacturing, and under-utilization of capacity. In addition, the sudden cessation of our power or water supply could damage our equipment, resulting in the need for costly repairs or maintenance, as well as damage to products in production, resulting in an increase in scrapped products.\nFor example, in the third quarter of 2014, one of our principal plants was affected by a five day unexpected power outage, which increased our manufacturing costs and caused delivery delays. There can be no assurance that our required utilities would not in the future experience material interruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutages, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events could disrupt our operations, and breaches of our security systems may cause us to incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing, and email communications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions. If we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, our operations could be disrupted. If unauthorized parties gain access to our information systems or such information is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost, or stolen during transmission, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties, and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel, and the loss of any of our key executive officers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated, and qualified managerial and professional personnel. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future. We can make no assurances that future changes in executive management will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our business also depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified employees, particularly engineering and sales and marketing personnel. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these employees could harm our business. Further, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies depends in part on our ability to retain key management and existing employees at the time of the acquisition.\nIn addition, key employees may depart for a variety of reasons, including because of issues relating to the difficulty of integration or accelerated retirement in connection with our acquisition of Viasystems. If key employees depart, the integration process may be more difficult and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying and hiring replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to our businesses, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Viasystems may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees or that the loss of any key executive officers would not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on the collective industry experience of our employees. If a significant number of these employees were to leave us, it could limit our ability to compete effectively and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes. We rely on the collective experience of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry. Although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees, if a significant number of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment, and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience, our manufacturing processes might suffer as we might be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry. As a result, we may lose our ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, we have experienced a significant amount of employee attrition in our China operations each year, which has negatively impacted our yield, costs of production, and service times.\nWe may be exposed to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties that could be costly to defend, could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and if successful, could result in liability.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these measures afford only limited protection. These measures may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology. We may not have the controls and procedures in place that are needed to adequately protect proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. As is the case with many other companies in the PCB industry, we from time to time receive communications from third parties asserting patent rights to our products and enter into discussions with such third parties. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur costs in either defending or settling any intellectual property disputes alleging infringement. If any claims are brought against the customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defending such claims. In the event we are subject to any infringement claims, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or in obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all, which could disrupt the production processes, damage our reputation, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change initiatives.\nOur manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties, which results in the generation of greenhouse gases, either directly on-site or indirectly at electric utilities. Both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy sources and supply choices, as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials that are derived from sources that generate greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition of Viasystems.\nParties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with our acquisition of Viasystems, including current or future business relationships with the combined company. Our business\nrelationships may be subject to disruption, as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the combined company. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the combined company, including a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Viasystems.\nFailure to maintain good relations with the noncontrolling interest holder of a majority-owned subsidiary of TTM in China could materially adversely affect our ability to manage that operation.\nA noncontrolling interest holder owns a 5% interest in a subsidiary of TTM that operates the Huiyang, China facility that became a part of our operations through the acquisition of Viasystems. The noncontrolling interest holder is affiliated with the Chinese government and has close ties to local economic development and other Chinese government agencies. The noncontrolling interest holder has certain rights to be consulted and to consent to certain operating and investment matters concerning the Huiyang facility and the board of directors of our subsidiary that operates the Huiyang facility. Failure to maintain good relations with the noncontrolling interest holder could materially adversely affect our ability to manage the operations of the plant.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our networks, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 88648, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "TTMI"}
