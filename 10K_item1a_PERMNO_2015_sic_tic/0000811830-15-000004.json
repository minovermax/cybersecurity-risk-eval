{"cik": "811830", "company": "Santander Holdings USA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks potentially impacting its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in transactions and are present in the business decisions made by the Company. Accordingly, the Company encounters risk as part of the normal course of its business, and risk management processes are designed to help manage these risks.\nRisk management is an important part of the Company's business model. The success of the business is dependent on management's ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by business activities so that management can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.\nThe following are the most significant risk factors that affect the Company. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, which are described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.\nMacro-Economic and Political Risks\nGiven our loan portfolios are concentrated in the United States; adverse changes affecting the economy of the United States could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur loan portfolios are concentrated in the United States. Accordingly, the recoverability of our loan portfolios and our ability to increase the amount of loans outstanding and our results of operations and financial condition in general are dependent to a significant extent on the level of economic activity in the United States. A return to recessionary conditions in the United States economy would likely have a significant adverse impact on our loan portfolios and, as a result, on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets.\nIn the past seven years, financial systems worldwide have experienced difficult credit and liquidity conditions and disruptions leading to less liquidity, greater volatility, general widening of spreads and, in some cases, lack of price transparency on interbank lending rates. Global economic conditions deteriorated significantly between 2007 and 2009, and the United States fell into recession. Although the United States has begun to recover, this recovery may not be sustainable. Many major financial institutions, including some of the country's largest commercial banks, investment banks, mortgage lenders, mortgage guarantors and insurance companies experienced, and some continue to experience, significant difficulties. Numerous institutions have sought additional capital or have received government assistance, and many lenders and institutional investors have reduced providing funding to borrowers (including to other financial institutions).\nIn particular, we face, among others, the following risks related to the economic downturn:\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation has increased and will increase our costs and may affect the pricing for our products and services and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u2022\nReduced demand for our products and services.\n\u2022\nInability of our borrowers to timely or fully comply with their existing obligations.\n\u2022\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The degree of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process and the sufficiency of our loan loss allowances.\n\u2022\nThe value and liquidity of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nAny worsening of economic conditions may delay the recovery of the financial industry and impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nMacroeconomic shocks may impact the household income of our retail customers negatively and adversely affect the recoverability of our retail loans, resulting in increased loan losses.\nDespite recent improvements in certain segments of the economy, some uncertainty remains concerning the future economic environment. There can be no assurance that economic conditions in these segments will continue to improve or that the United States' economic condition as a whole will improve significantly. Such economic uncertainty could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Investors remain cautious. A slowing or failing of the economic recovery would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on us and on others in the financial services industry.\nIncreased disruption and volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable to us, if at all. If capital markets financing ceases to become available, or becomes excessively expensive, we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits to attract more customers and become unable to maintain certain liability maturities. Any such increase in capital markets funding availability or costs or in deposit rates could have a material adverse effect on our interest margins and liquidity.\nIf some or all of the foregoing risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may suffer adverse effects as a result of economic and sovereign debt tensions.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally, which, although improving recently, continue to show signs of fragility and volatility. We have direct and indirect exposure to financial and economic conditions throughout the United States. A deterioration of the economic and financial environment could have a material adverse impact on the whole financial sector, creating new challenges in corporate lending and resulting in significant disruptions in financial activities at both the market and retail levels. This could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial position and prospects.\nOur growth, asset quality and profitability may be adversely affected by volatile macroeconomic and political conditions.\nThe United States economy has experienced volatility recently, characterized by slow or regressive growth. This volatility resulted in fluctuations in the levels of deposits and in the relative economic strength of various segments of the economy to which we lend.\nNegative and fluctuating economic conditions, such as a changing interest rate environment, impact our profitability by causing lending margins to decrease and leading to decreased demand for higher margin products and services. Negative and fluctuating economic conditions could also result in government defaults on public debt. This could affect us in two ways: directly, through portfolio losses, and indirectly, through instabilities that a default in public debt could cause to the banking system as a whole, particularly since commercial banks' exposure to government debt is high in certain Latin American and European regions or countries.\nIn addition, our revenues are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, social instability, and changes in governmental policies, international ownership legislation, interest-rate caps and tax policies.\nGrowth, asset quality and profitability may be affected by volatile macroeconomic and political conditions.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to substantial regulation which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, which materially affects our businesses. The statutes, regulations, and policies to which the Company is subject may be changed at any time. In addition, the interpretation and application by regulators of the laws and regulations to which the Company is subject may change from time to time. Extensive legislation affecting the financial services industry has recently been adopted in the United States, and regulations are in the process of being implemented. The manner in which those laws and related regulations are applied to the operations of financial institutions is still evolving. Any legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business operations resulting from such legislation and regulations could result in significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging and provide certain products and services, affect the value of assets we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance and other costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or in their interpretation or application will not affect us adversely.\nRegulation of the Company as a BHC includes limitations on the permissible activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve could exercise its authority to restrict the Company and its subsidiaries from paying dividends if, in the Federal Reserve's view, any such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Moreover, as described below, the Company and the Bank are required to perform stress tests and submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve and the OCC on an annual basis, and receive a notice of non-objection to the plans from the Federal Reserve and the OCC before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties and enforcement actions for violations we may commit, and has the authority to disallow acquisitions we or our subsidiaries may contemplate, which may limit our future growth plans. Such constraints currently applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries and/or regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOther regulations which significantly affect the Company, or which could significantly affect the Company in the future, relate to capital requirements, liquidity and funding, taxation of the financial sector, and development of regulatory reforms in the United States, and are discussed in further detail below.\nSignificant Global Regulation\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on comprehensive changes to the capital adequacy framework, known as Basel III. A revised version of Basel III was published in June 2011. Basel III is intended to raise the resilience of the banking sector by increasing both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and enhancing the risk coverage of the capital framework. The changes in Basel III are intended to be phased in gradually between January 2015 and January 2019.\nThere can be no assurance that the implementation of these new standards will not adversely affect the Company's or its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or require it to issue additional securities that qualify as regulatory capital, liquidate assets, curtail business or take any other actions, any of which may have adverse effects on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations. Furthermore, increased capital requirements may negatively affect the Company's return on equity and other financial performance indicators.\nEffective management of our capital position is important to our ability to operate our business, continue to grow organically, and pursue our business strategy. However, in response to the global financial crisis, a number of changes to the regulatory capital framework have been adopted or continue to be considered. As these and other changes are implemented or future changes are considered or adopted that limit our ability to manage our balance sheet and capital resources effectively or access funding on commercially acceptable terms, we may experience a material adverse effect on our financial condition and regulatory capital position.\nIn addition to the changes to the capital adequacy framework described above, the Basel Committee also published its global quantitative liquidity framework, comprising the LCR and NSFR metrics, with objectives to (1) promote the short-term resilience of banks\u2019 liquidity risk profiles by ensuring they have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant stress scenario; and (2) promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating incentives for banks to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. The LCR was subsequently revised by the Basel Committee in January 2013 and includes a revised timetable for phase-in of the standard from 2015 to 2019, as well as some technical changes to some of the stress scenario assumptions. In January 2014, the Basel Committee published amendments to the leverage ratio and technical revisions to the NSFR, confirming that it remains its intention that the latter ratio, including any future revisions, will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. In addition, in January 2014, the Basel Committee proposed uniform disclosure standards related to the LCR and issued a new modification to the ratio, which should be adopted by banks beginning at January 1, 2015.\nSignificant United States Regulation\nThe DFA, which was adopted in 2010, will continue to result in significant structural reforms affecting the financial services industry. This legislation provided for, among other things, the establishment of the CFPB with broad authority to regulate the credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services that we offer, the creation of a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies, more comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, prohibitions on engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, restrictions on ownership of, investment in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, restrictions on interchange fees earned through debit card transactions, and a requirement that bank regulators phase out the treatment of trust preferred capital instruments as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes.\nWith respect to OTC derivatives, the DFA provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory clearing, exchange trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives. Entities that are swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants or major security-based swap participants are required to register with the SEC or the CFTC, or both, and are or will be subject to new capital, margin, business conduct, record-keeping, clearing, execution, reporting and other requirements. We may register as a swap dealer with the CFTC. Although many significant regulations applicable to swap dealers are already in effect, some of the most important requirements, such as margin requirements for uncleared swaps, have not yet been implemented, and we continue to assess how compliance with these new rules will affect our business.\nIn July 2013, United States bank regulators issued the United States Basel III final rules implementing the Basel III capital framework for United States banks and BHCs. Certain aspects of the United States Basel III final rules, such as new minimum capital ratios and a revised methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets, became effective on January 1, 2015. Other aspects of the United States Basel III final rules, such as the capital conservation buffer and the new regulatory deductions from and adjustments to capital, will be phased in over several years beginning on January 1, 2015.\nIn addition, in October 2014, the Federal Reserve and other United States regulators issued a final rule introducing a quantitative liquidity coverage ratio requirement on certain large banks and BHCs. The liquidity coverage ratio is broadly consistent with the Basel Committee\u2019s revised Basel III liquidity rules, but is more stringent in several important respects. The Federal Reserve has stated that it intends, through future rule-makings, to apply the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio and NSFR to the United States operations of some or all large FBOs.\nOn February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the Final Rule to enhance its supervision and regulation of certain FBOs. Among other things, this rule requires FBOs with over $50 billion of United States non-branch assets to establish or designate a United States IHC and to transfer its entire ownership interest in substantially all of its United States subsidiaries to that IHC by July 1, 2016. United States branches and agencies are not required to be transferred to the IHC. The IHC will be subject to an enhanced supervision framework, including enhanced risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity requirements, risk/management requirements, and stress-testing requirements. A phased-in approach is being used for the standards and requirements. Certain enhanced prudential standards are effective on January 1, 2015, with other standards and requirements are phased in between July 1, 2016 and January 1, 2018. The final rule also required Santander, as an FBO with United States total consolidated assets of more than $50 billion as of June 30, 2014, to submit an IHC implementation plan to the Federal Reserve by January 1, 2015. We submitted our IHC Implementation Plan on December 31, 2014. Compliance with this plan may cause Santander to invest significant management attention and resources.\nWithin the DFA, the Volcker Rule prohibits \u201cbanking entities\u201d from engaging in certain forms of proprietary trading or from sponsoring or investing in covered funds, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also limits the ability of banking entities and their affiliates to enter into certain transactions with such funds with which they or their affiliates have certain relationships. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 and, on December 10, 2013; United States regulators issued final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. The final rules contain exclusions and certain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, and trading in United States government and agency obligations as well as certain foreign government obligations, trading solely outside the United States, and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued an order extending the period for all banking entities to conform to the Volcker Rule and implement a compliance program until July 21, 2016, and additional extensions are possible. Banking entities must bring their activities and investments into compliance with the requirements of the Volcker Rule by the end of the conformance period. We are assessing how the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule will affect our businesses, and are developing and implementing plans to bring affected businesses into compliance.\nFurthermore, Title I of the DFA and the implementing regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC require each BHC with assets of $50 billion or more, including Santander, to prepare and submit a plan annually for the orderly resolution of our subsidiaries and operations domiciled in the United States in the event of future material financial distress or failure. The plan must include information on resolution strategy, major counterparties, and interdependencies, among other things, and requires substantial effort, time, and cost to prepare. Santander submitted its United States resolution plan in December 2014. The United States resolution plan is subject to review by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.\n.\nEach of these aspects of the DFA, as well as other changes in United States banking regulations, may directly and indirectly impact various aspects of our business. The full spectrum of risks that the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule, poses to us is not yet known. However, such risks could be material and could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings.\nAs noted above, we face risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings, including tax proceedings that could subject us to monetary judgments, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties. The current regulatory environment reflects an increased supervisory focus on enforcement, combined with uncertainty about the evolution of the regulatory regime, and may lead to material operational and compliance costs.\nWe are subject to certain claims and parties to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business from time to time, including in connection with lending activities, relationships with our employees and other commercial or tax matters. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly when the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or when the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in the early stages of discovery, we cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be. We believe that we have established adequate reserves related to the costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with these various claims and legal proceedings. However, the amount of these provisions is substantially less than the total amount of the claims asserted against us and in light of the uncertainties involved in such claims and proceedings; there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have currently accrued. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and our level of income for that period.\nIn addition, from time to time, the Company is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The Company is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the relevant government agencies to which we report have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on us. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes.\nWhile we review our relevant counterparties\u2019 internal policies and procedures with respect to such matters, we, to a large degree, rely on our relevant counterparties to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate anti-money laundering procedures. Such measures, procedures and compliance may not be completely effective in preventing third parties from using our (and our relevant counterparties\u2019) services as a conduits for money laundering (including illegal cash operations) without our (and our relevant counterparties\u2019) knowledge. If we are associated with, or even accused of being associated with, or become a party to, money laundering, our reputation could suffer and/or we could become subject to fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement (including being added to any \u201cblacklists\u201d that would prohibit certain parties from engaging in transactions with us), any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nAn incorrect interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely affect us.\nThe preparation of our tax returns requires the use of estimates and interpretations of complex tax laws and regulations, and is subject to review by taxing authorities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States and certain foreign countries. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and relevant governmental taxing authorities, which are sometimes subject to prolonged evaluation periods until a final resolution, is reached. In establishing a provision for income tax expense and filing returns, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. If the judgments, estimates, and assumptions we use in preparing our tax returns are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in taxes and other assessments may adversely affect us.\nThe legislatures and tax authorities in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate regularly enact reforms to the tax and other assessment regimes to which we and our customers are subject. Such reforms include changes in the rate of assessments and, occasionally, enactment of temporary taxes, the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes. The effects of these changes and any other changes that result from enactment of additional tax reforms cannot be quantified and there can be no assurance that any such reforms would not have an adverse effect upon our business.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and relevant governmental taxing authorities, which are sometimes subject to prolonged evaluation periods until a final resolution, is reached. In establishing a provision for income tax expense and filing returns, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. If the judgments, estimates and assumptions the Company uses in preparing its tax returns are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations.\nLiquidity and Financing Risks\nLiquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we either do not have available sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or can secure them only at excessive cost. This risk is inherent in any retail and commercial banking business and can be heightened by a number of enterprise-specific factors, including over-reliance on a particular source of funding, changes in credit ratings or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation. While we implement liquidity management processes to seek to mitigate and control these risks, unforeseen systemic market factors in particular make it difficult to eliminate these risks completely. Adverse and continued constraints in the supply of liquidity, including inter-bank lending, may materially and adversely affect the cost of funding our business, and extreme liquidity constraints may affect our current operations as well as limit growth possibilities.\nDisruption and volatility in the global financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable to us.\nOur cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and to our credit spreads. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of our funding. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven, and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile.\nIf wholesale markets financing ceases to become available, or becomes excessively expensive, we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits, with a view to attracting more customers, and/or to sell assets, potentially at depressed prices. The persistence or worsening of these adverse market conditions or an increase in base interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access liquidity and cost of funding (whether directly or indirectly).\nWe rely, and will continue to rely, primarily on commercial deposits to fund lending activities. The ongoing availability of this type of funding is sensitive to a variety of factors outside our control, such as general economic conditions and the confidence of commercial depositors in the economy, in general, and the financial services industry in particular, as well as competition between banks for commercial deposits. Any of these factors could significantly increase the amount of commercial deposit withdrawals in a short period of time, thereby reducing our ability to access commercial deposit funding in the future on appropriate terms, or at all. If these circumstances were to arise, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe anticipate that our customers will continue to make short-term deposits (particularly demand deposits and short-term time deposits) in the near future and we intend to maintain our emphasis on the use of banking deposits as a source of funds. The short-term nature of this funding source could cause liquidity problems for us in the future if deposits are not made in the volumes we expect or are not renewed. If a substantial number of our depositors withdraw their demand deposits or do not roll over their time deposits upon maturity, we may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system, we will be able to maintain levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments or the liquidation of certain assets. If this were to happen, we could be materially adversely affected.\nCredit, market and liquidity risk may have an adverse effect on our credit ratings and our cost of funds. Any downgrading in our credit rating would likely increase our cost of funding, require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts and adversely affect our interest margins and results of operations.\nCredit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.\nAny downgrade in our debt credit ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs and require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts, and could limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our commercial business. For example, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our products, engage in certain longer-term and derivatives transactions and retain our customers, particularly customers who need a minimum rating threshold in order to invest. In addition, under the terms of certain of our derivative contracts, we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or terminate the contracts. Any of these results of a ratings downgrade, in turn, could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on us, including our operating results and financial condition.\nWe conduct a significant number of our material derivative activities through Santander and Santander UK. We estimate that as of December 31, 2014, if all the rating agencies were to downgrade Santander\u2019s or Santander UK\u2019s long-term senior debt ratings we would be required to post additional collateral pursuant to derivative and other financial contracts. Refer to further discussion in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhile certain potential impacts of these downgrades are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain, as they depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including market conditions at the time of any downgrade, whether any downgrade of a firm\u2019s long-term credit rating precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit rating, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. Actual outflows could be higher or lower than this hypothetical example, depending upon certain factors including which credit rating agency downgrades our credit rating, any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce cash outflows and the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding (such as from money market funds) or loss of secured funding capacity. Although, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in our stress testing scenarios and a portion of our total liquid assets is held against these risks, it is still the case that a credit rating downgrade could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Bank, or SCUSA.\nIn addition, if we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace such contracts, our market risk profile could be altered.\nIn light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that the rating agencies will maintain their current ratings or outlooks. Failure to maintain favorable ratings and outlooks could increase the cost of funding and adversely affect interest margins, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCredit Risks\nIf we are unable to effectively control the level of non-performing or poor credit quality loans in the future, or if our loan loss reserves are insufficient to cover future loan losses, this could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of our businesses. Non-performing or low credit quality loans have in the past negatively impacted and can continue to negatively impact our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively control the level of impaired loans in our loan portfolio. In particular, the amount of our reported non-performing loans may increase in the future as a result of growth in our total loan portfolio, including as a result of loan portfolios that we may acquire in the future, or factors beyond our control, such as adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in economic conditions in the United States, the impact of political events, events affecting certain industries or events affecting financial markets.\nOur current loan loss reserves may not be adequate to cover any increase in the amount of non-performing loans or any future deterioration in the overall credit quality of our total loan portfolio. Our loan loss reserves are based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio. These factors include, among other things, our borrowers\u2019 financial condition, repayment abilities and repayment intentions, the realizable value of any collateral, the prospects for support from any guarantor, government macroeconomic policies, interest rates and the legal and regulatory environment. As the recent global financial crisis has demonstrated, many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result, there is no precise method for predicting loan and credit losses, and we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. If our assessment of and expectations concerning the above-mentioned factors differ from actual developments, if the quality of our total loan portfolio deteriorates for any reason, including an increase in lending to individuals and small and medium enterprises, a volume increase in the credit card portfolio and the introduction of new products, or if future actual losses exceed our estimates of incurred losses, we may be required to increase our loan loss reserves, which may adversely affect us. If we were unable to control or reduce the level of our non-performing or poor credit quality loans, this also could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMortgage loans are one of our principal assets, comprising 8.9% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we have exposure to a number of large real estate developers. As a result, we are exposed to developments in housing markets. From 2002 to 2007, demand for housing and mortgage financing increased significantly driven by, among other things, economic growth, declining unemployment rates, demographic and social trends and historically low interest rates. During late 2007, the housing market began to adjust as a result of excess supply and higher interest rates. Since 2008, persistent housing oversupply, decreased housing demand, rising unemployment, subdued earnings growth, greater pressure on disposable income, a decline in the availability of mortgage financing and the continued effect of market volatility have caused home prices to decline, while mortgage delinquencies increased. These trends, especially higher unemployment rates coupled with declining real estate prices, could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage payment delinquency rates, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan and investment portfolios are subject to risk of prepayment, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur fixed rate loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a borrower or issuer to pay a debt obligation prior to maturity. Generally, in a declining interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, this reduces the weighted average lives of our earning assets and could have a material adverse effect on us. We would also be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on credit card and collateralized mortgage loans, since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these assets, which may result in a mismatch in our funding obligations and reinvestment at lower yields. Prepayment risk is inherent in our commercial activity and an increase in prepayments could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe value of the collateral securing our loans may not be sufficient, and we may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio.\nThe value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond our control, including macroeconomic factors affecting the United States. The value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may be adversely affected by force majeure events such as natural disasters, particularly in locations in which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is composed of real estate loans. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods may cause widespread damage, which could impair the asset quality of our loan portfolio and have an adverse impact on the economy of the affected region. We also may not have sufficiently recent information on the value of collateral, which may result in an inaccurate assessment for impairment losses of our loans secured by such collateral. If any of the above were to occur, we may need to make additional provisions to cover actual impairment losses of our loans, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk in our banking business.\nWe are exposed to counterparty risk in addition to credit risks associated with lending activities. Counterparty risk may arise from, for example, investing in securities of third parties, entering into derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us or executing securities, futures, currency or commodity trades from proprietary trading activities that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries.\nWe routinely transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional clients. Defaults by, and even rumors or questions about the solvency of, certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions. Many of the routine transactions we enter into expose us to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of our significant counterparties.\nMarket Risks\nWe are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and other market risks, which may materially and adversely affect us.\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in our net interest income or in the market value of our assets and liabilities due to volatility of interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. Changes in interest rates affect the following areas, among others, of our business:\n\u2022\nnet interest income;\n\u2022\nthe volume of loans originated;\n\u2022\nthe market value of our securities holdings;\n\u2022\ngains from sales of loans and securities; and\n\u2022\ngains and losses from derivatives.\nVariations in short-term interest rates could affect our net interest income, which comprises the majority of our revenue, reducing our growth rate and potentially resulting in losses. When interest rates rise, we may be required to pay higher interest on our floating-rate borrowings while interest earned on our fixed-rate assets does not rise as quickly, which could cause profits to grow at a reduced rate or decline in some parts of our portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including increased regulation of the financial sector, monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce the volume of loans we originate. Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. Increases in interest rates may also reduce the propensity of our customers to prepay or refinance fixed-rate loans. Increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our financial assets and may reduce gains or require us to record losses on sales of our loans or securities.\nIf interest rates decrease, although this would be likely to reduce our funding costs, it also would be likely to compress our net interest margins, as well as, adversely impact the income we receive arising from our investments in securities and loans with similar maturities, which could have a negative effect on us. In addition, we may experience increased delinquencies in a low interest rate environment when such an environment is accompanied by high unemployment and recessionary conditions.\nThe market value of a security with a fixed interest rate generally decreases when prevailing interest rates rise, which may have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. In addition, we may incur costs (which, in turn, will impact our results) as we implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure. The market value of an obligation with a floating interest rate can be adversely affected when interest rates increase, due to a lag in the implementation of repricing terms or an inability to refinance at lower rates.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies may negatively affect our earnings and value of our assets and securities.\nWe are also exposed to equity price risk in connection with our trading investments in equity securities. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of our investment and trading portfolios. The volatility of world equity markets due to the continued economic uncertainty and sovereign debt crisis has had a particularly strong impact on the financial sector. Continued volatility may affect the value of our investments in entities in this sector and, depending on their fair value and future recovery expectations could become a permanent impairment which would be subject to write-offs against our results. To the extent any of these risks materialize, our net interest income or the market value of our assets and liabilities could be materially adversely affected.\nMarket conditions have resulted, and could result, in material changes to the estimated fair values of our financial assets. Negative fair value adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn the past seven years, financial markets have been subject to significant stress resulting in steep falls in perceived or actual financial asset values, particularly due to volatility in financial markets and the resulting widening of credit spreads. We have material exposures to securities and other investments that are recorded at fair value and are therefore exposed to potential negative fair value adjustments. Asset valuations in future periods, reflecting then-prevailing market conditions, may result in negative changes in the fair values of our financial assets and these also may translate into increased impairments. In addition, the value we ultimately realize on disposal of the asset may be lower than its current fair value. Any of these factors could require us to record negative fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, to the extent that fair values are determined using financial valuation models, such values may be inaccurate or subject to change, as the data used by such models may not be available or may become unavailable due to changes in market conditions, particularly for illiquid assets and in times of economic instability. In such circumstances, our valuation methodologies require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates in order to establish fair value, and reliable assumptions are difficult to make, are inherently uncertain and valuation models are complex, making them inherently imperfect predictors of actual results. Any resulting impairments or write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to market, operational and other related risks associated with our derivative transactions that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes as well as for hedging purposes. We are subject to market, credit and operational risks associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or default risk (the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder, including providing sufficient collateral).\nThe execution and performance of derivative transactions depend on our ability to maintain adequate control and administration systems and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, our ability to adequately monitor, analyze and report derivative transactions continues to depend, to a great extent, on our information technology systems. These factors further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisk Management\nFailure to successfully implement and continue to improve our risk management policies, procedures and methods, including our credit risk management system, could materially and adversely affect us, and we may be exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nThe management of risk is an integral part of our activities. We seek to monitor and manage our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, market, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. Although we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate.\nSome of our qualitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. We apply statistical and other tools to these observations to arrive at quantifications of our risk exposures. These qualitative tools and metrics may fail to predict future risk exposures. These risk exposures could, for example, arise from factors we did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in our statistical models. This would limit our ability to manage our risks. Our losses thus could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, our quantified modeling does not take all risks into account. Our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses. If existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate, they could take their business elsewhere. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nAs a commercial bank, one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk. For example, an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit rating system to assess the particular risk profile of a customer. Since this process involves detailed analyses of the customer, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors, it is subject to human error. In exercising their judgment, our employees may not always assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk, which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system.\nWe have been trying to refine our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers. However, we may not be able to timely detect these risks before they occur, or due to limited tools available to us, our employees may not be able to implement them effectively, which may increase our credit risk. Failure to effectively implement, consistently follow or continuously refine our credit risk management system may result in an increase in the level of non-performing loans and a higher risk exposure for us, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGeneral Business and Industry Risks\nThe financial problems faced by our customers could adversely affect us.\nMarket turmoil and economic recession could materially and adversely affect the liquidity, businesses and/or financial conditions of our borrowers, which could in turn increase our NPL ratios, impair our loan and other financial assets and result in decreased demand for borrowings in general. In addition, our customers may further decrease their risk tolerance to non-deposit investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds significantly, which would adversely affect our fee and commission income. Any of the conditions described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our pension liabilities and obligations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe provide retirement benefits for many of our former and current employees through a number of employee benefit plans. We calculate the amount of our defined benefit obligations using actuarial techniques and assumptions, including mortality rates, the rate of increase of salaries, discount rates, inflation, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and other assumptions. In light of the nature of these obligations, changes in the assumptions that support valuations, including market conditions, can result in actuarial losses, which would in turn impact the financial condition of our pension funds. Since pension and other employee benefit plan obligations are generally long-term obligations, fluctuations in interest rates have a material impact on the projected costs of our defined benefit obligations and therefore on the amount of employee benefit plan expense we accrue.\nAny increase in the current size of the deficit in our defined benefit pension plan, due to reduction in the value of the pension fund assets (depending on the performance of financial markets) or an increase in pension fund liabilities due to changes in mortality assumptions, the rate of increase of salaries, discount rate assumptions, inflation, the expected rate of return on plan assets, or other factors, could result in our having to make increased contributions to reduce or satisfy the deficits which would divert resources from use in other areas of our business and reduce our capital resources. While we can control a number of the above factors, there are some over which we have no or limited control. Increases in our pension liabilities and obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend in part upon dividends and other funds from subsidiaries.\nSome of our operations are conducted through our financial services subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay dividends, to the extent we decide to do so, depends in part on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and pay dividends to us. Payment of dividends, distributions and advances by our subsidiaries will be contingent on our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations, and are limited by legal, regulatory, and contractual restrictions. Additionally, our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries as an equity holder of such subsidiaries, upon their liquidation or reorganization, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors.\nIncreased competition and industry consolidation may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition in all parts of our business, including in originating loans and attracting deposits. Our competition in originating loans comes principally from other domestic and foreign banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other lenders and purchasers of loans.\nIn addition, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the banking industry, which has created larger and stronger banks with which we must now compete. There can be no assurance that this increased competition will not adversely affect our growth prospects, and therefore our operations. We also face competition from non-bank competitors, such as brokerage companies, department stores (for some credit products), leasing and factoring companies, mutual fund and pension fund management companies and insurance companies.\nIncreasing competition could require that we increase our rates offered on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans, which could also have a material adverse effect on us, including our profitability. It may also negatively affect our business results and prospects by, among other things, limiting our ability to increase our customer base and expand our operations and increasing competition for investment opportunities.\nIn addition, if our customer service levels were perceived by the market to be materially below those of our competitors, we could lose existing and potential business. If we are not successful in retaining and strengthening customer relationships, we may lose market share, incur losses on some or all of our activities or fail to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends, in part, on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties, and we may not be able to manage various risks we face as we expand our range of products and services that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our operations and our profitability depends, in part, on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that our new products and services will be responsive to client demands or successful once they are offered to our clients, or that they will be successful in the future. In addition, our clients\u2019 needs or desires may change over time, and such changes may render our products and services obsolete, outdated or unattractive and we may not be able to develop new products that meet our clients\u2019 changing needs. If we cannot respond in a timely fashion to the changing needs of our clients, we may lose clients, which could in turn materially and adversely affect us.\nAs we expand the range of our products and services, some of which may be at an early stage of development in the markets of certain regions in which we operate, we will be exposed to new and potentially increasingly complex risks and development expenses. Our employees and risk management systems as well as our experience and that of our partners may not be adequate to enable us to handle or manage such risks properly. In addition, the cost of developing products that are not launched is likely to affect our results of operations. Any or all of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFurther, our customers may issue complaints and seek redress if they consider that they have suffered loss from our products and services, for example, as a result of any alleged mis-selling or incorrect application of the terms or conditions of a particular product. This could in turn subject us to risks of potential legal action by our customers and intervention by our regulators. For further detail on our legal and regulatory risk exposures, please see the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe are exposed to risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings.\nIf we are unable to manage the growth of our operations, this could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe allocate management and planning resources to develop strategic plans for organic growth, and to identify possible acquisitions and disposals and areas for restructuring our businesses. From time to time, we evaluate acquisition and partnership opportunities that we believe offer additional value to our shareholder and are consistent with our business strategy. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or partnership candidates, and our ability to benefit from any such acquisitions or partnerships will depend in part on our successful integration of those businesses. Any such integration entails significant risks such as unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems and unexpected liabilities or contingencies relating to the acquired businesses, including legal claims. We can give no assurances that our expectations with regard to integration and synergies will materialize. We also cannot provide assurance that we will, in all cases, be able to manage our growth effectively or deliver our strategic growth objectives. Challenges that may result from our strategic growth decisions include our ability to:\n\u2022\nmanage efficiently the operations and employees of expanding businesses;\n\u2022\nmaintain or grow our existing customer base;\n\u2022\nassess the value, strengths and weaknesses of investment or acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nfinance strategic investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nfully integrate strategic investments, or newly-established entities or acquisitions in line with our strategy;\n\u2022\nalign our current information technology systems adequately with those of an enlarged group;\n\u2022\napply our risk management policy effectively to an enlarged group; and\n\u2022\nmanage a growing number of entities without over-committing management or losing key personnel.\nAny failure to manage growth effectively, including relating to any or all of the above challenges associated with our growth plans, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nGoodwill impairments may be required in relation to acquired businesses.\nWe have made business acquisitions where it is possible that the goodwill which has been attributed to those businesses may have to be written down if our valuation assumptions are required to be reassessed as a result of any deterioration in the business\u2019 underlying profitability, asset quality or other relevant matters. Impairment testing with respect to goodwill is performed annually, more frequently if impairment indicators are present, and includes a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment exists and a second step to measure the amount of impairment, if any, must be performed. This second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination upon acquisition. . While no impairment of goodwill was recognized in 2013 or 2014, there can be no assurance that we will not have to write down the value attributed to goodwill in the future, which does not affect our regulatory capital, but would adversely affect our results of operations and net assets.\nWe rely on recruiting, retaining and developing appropriate senior management and skilled personnel.\nOur continued success depends in part on the continued service of key members of our management team. The ability to continue to attract, train, motivate and retain highly qualified professionals is a key element of our strategy. The successful implementation of our growth strategy depends on the availability of skilled management, both at our head office and at each of our business units. If we or one of our business units or other functions fails to staff its operations appropriately or loses one or more of its key senior executives and fails to replace them in a satisfactory and timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations, including control and operational risks, may be adversely affected.\nThe financial industry in the United States has and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees. In addition, due to our relationship with Santander, we also are subject to indirect regulation by the European Central Bank, which has recently imposed compensation restrictions that may apply to certain of our executive officers and other employees under the Capital Requirements Directive IV prudential rules. These restrictions may impact our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail or are unable to attract and train, motivate and retain qualified professionals appropriately, our business may also be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties for important products and services.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as loan and deposit servicing systems, internet connections and network access. Third parties can be sources of operational risk to us, including with respect to security breaches affecting such parties. We may be required to take steps to protect the integrity of our operational systems, thereby increasing our operational costs and potentially decreasing customer satisfaction. In addition, any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason, their performing their services poorly, or employee misconduct could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise to conduct business. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delays and expense.\nDamage to our reputation could cause harm to our business prospects.\nMaintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities of customers and counterparties. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may result in harm to our prospects.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of, or individuals in, the industry can also affect our reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis and the seeming shift toward increasing regulatory supervision and enforcement has caused public perception of us and others in the financial services industry to decline.\nWe could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions against us. Therefore, there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.\nThe Bank engages in transactions with its subsidiaries or affiliates that others may not consider to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe Bank and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of services agreements pursuant to which we render services, such as administrative, accounting, finance, treasury, legal services and others.\nUnited States law applicable to public companies and financial groups and institutions provide for several procedures designed to ensure that the transactions entered into with or among our financial subsidiaries and/or affiliates do not deviate from prevailing market conditions for those types of transactions.\nThe Bank is likely to continue to engage in transactions with our affiliates. Future conflicts of interests between us and any of affiliates, or among our affiliates, may arise, which conflicts are not required to be and may not be resolved in our favor.\nTechnology Risks\nAny failure to effectively improve or upgrade our information technology infrastructure and management information systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to upgrade our information technology on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must continually make significant investments and improvements in our information technology infrastructure in order to remain competitive. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to maintain the level of capital expenditures necessary to support the improvement or upgrading of our information technology infrastructure. Any failure to improve or upgrade our information technology infrastructure and management information systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks relating to data collection, processing and storage systems are inherent in our business.\nOur businesses depend on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately, and on our ability to rely on our digital technologies, computer and e-mail services, spreadsheets, software and networks, as well as on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. The proper functioning of financial controls, accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively. Losses can result from inadequate personnel, inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems, or external events that interrupt normal business operations. We also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures proves to be inadequate or is circumvented. Although we work with our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and prevent against cyber-attacks, we routinely exchange personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means, and we may be the target of attempted cyber-attacks. If we cannot maintain an effective data collection, management and processing system, we may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe take protective measures and continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, but our systems, software and networks nevertheless may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses from operational risk in the future, including relating to cyber-attacks or other such security breaches. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may incur significant costs in its attempt to modify or enhance our protective measures or investigate or remediate any vulnerability.\nFailure to protect personal information could adversely affect us.\nWe manage and hold confidential personal information of customers in the conduct of our banking operations. Although we have procedures and controls to safeguard personal information in our possession, unauthorized disclosures could subject us to legal actions and administrative sanctions as well as damages that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and prospects.\nFinancial Reporting and Control Risks\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe accounting standard setters and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if inaccurate, could cause material misstatement of the results of our operations and financial position.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. The accounting policies deemed critical to our results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgments and estimates, include impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, valuation of financial instruments, impairment of available-for-sale financial assets, deferred tax assets and provisions for liabilities.\nThe ACL is a significant critical estimate. Due to the inherent nature of this estimate, we cannot provide assurance that the Company will not significantly increase the ACL or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance.\nThe valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value can be subjective, in particular when models are used which include unobservable inputs. Given the uncertainty and subjectivity associated with valuing such instruments it is possible that the results of our operations and financial position could be materially misstated if the estimates and assumptions used prove inaccurate.\nIf the judgments, estimates and assumptions we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations and a corresponding effect on our funding requirements and capital ratios.\nDisclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nDisclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nThese disclosure controls and procedures have inherent limitations, which include the possibilities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by any unauthorized override of the controls. Consequently, our businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct or negligence and fraud, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of \u2018rogue traders\u2019 or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nRisks Associated with our Majority-Owned Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe financial results of SCUSA could have a negative impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nSCUSA historically has provided a significant source of funding to the Company through earnings. Our investment in SCUSA involves risk, including the possibility that poor operating results of SCUSA could negatively affect the operating results of SHUSA.\nFactors that affect the financial results of SCUSA in addition to those which have been previously addressed include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nPeriods of economic slowdown may result in decreased demand for automobiles as well as declining values of automobiles and other consumer products used as collateral to secure outstanding accounts. Higher gasoline prices, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors which impact consumer confidence could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown, servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in finance charge income. Changes in the economy may impact the collateral value of repossessed automobiles and repossession and foreclosure sales may not yield sufficient proceeds to repay the receivables in full and may result in losses.\n\u2022\nSCUSA\u2019s growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are outside of its control, including general economic conditions, the ability to obtain adequate financing for growth, laws and regulatory environments in the states in which the business seeks to operate, competition in new markets, the ability to attract new customers, the ability to recruit qualified personnel, and the ability to obtain and maintain all required approvals, permits, and licenses on a timely basis.\n\u2022\nThe Chrysler Agreement may not result in the anticipated levels of growth, and the agreement is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in its termination if SCUSA is unable to meet them.\n\u2022\nSCUSA\u2019s business may be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships that correlate to SCUSA\u2019s ability to acquire loans and automotive leases. In addition, economic downturns may result in the closure of dealerships and corresponding decreases in sales and loan volumes.\n\u2022\nSCUSA has repurchase obligations in its capacity as a servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If significant repurchases of assets or other payments are required under its responsibility as a servicer, this could have a material adverse effect on SCUSA\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe obligations associated with being a public company will require significant resources and management attention which will increase the costs of SCUSA's operations and may divert focus from business operations. As a result of its IPO, SCUSA is now required to remain in compliance with the reporting requirements of the SEC and the NYSE, maintain corporate infrastructure required of a public company, and incur significant legal and financial compliance costs, which may divert SCUSA management\u2019s attention and resources from implementing its growth strategy.\n\u2022\nThe market price of SCUSA Common Stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in SCUSA Common Stock to decline. Conditions affecting the market price of SCUSA Common Stock may be beyond SCUSA\u2019s control and include general market conditions, economic factors, actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results, changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations related to future financial performance, analysts\u2019 estimates of SCUSA\u2019s financial performance or lack of research or reports by industry analysts, changes in market valuations of similar companies, future sales of SCUSA Common Stock, or additions or departures of its key personnel.", "PERMNO": 10562, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STD2"}
