{"cik": "1334978", "company": "Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions\nWe derive revenues from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 resulted in a decline in advertising and marketing by our customers, which resulted in a decline in advertising revenues across our businesses. This reduction in advertising revenues had an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Global economic conditions have been slow to recover and remain uncertain. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, economic uncertainty increases or economic conditions deteriorate again, global economic conditions may once again adversely impact our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate revenues in specific markets is directly affected by local and regional conditions, and unfavorable regional economic conditions also may adversely impact our results. In addition, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, an individual business sector or market may experience a downturn, causing it to reduce its advertising expenditures, which also may adversely impact our results.\nTo service our debt obligations and to fund our operations and our capital expenditures, we require a significant amount of cash to meet our needs, which depends on many factors beyond our control\nOur ability to service our debt obligations and to fund our operations and our capital expenditures for display construction, renovation or maintenance requires a significant amount of cash. Our primary sources of liquidity are currently cash on hand, cash flow from operations, the intercompany arrangements provided for in the cash management order approved in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and our receivables-based credit facility. Following the Separation, the intercompany arrangements with iHeartCommunications will cease, and we expect to have the iHeart Line of Credit and the proceeds from the issuance of the CCOH Preferred Stock as sources of liquidity.\nOur primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other funding requirements. A substantial amount of our cash requirements are for debt service obligations. During 2018, we spent $375.5 million of cash on interest on our debt. We anticipate having approximately $346.3 million of cash interest payment obligations in 2019. Our significant interest payment obligations reduce our financial flexibility, make us more vulnerable to changes in operating\nperformance and economic downturns generally, reduce our liquidity over time and could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and cash from operations and our ability to manage our liquidity following the Separation, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the purchase price of possible acquisitions, capital expenditures for deployment of digital billboards and/or other strategic initiatives could require additional indebtedness or equity financing. Historically, our cash management arrangement with iHeartCommunications has been our only committed external source of liquidity. Following the Separation, we will be dependent upon our ability to generate cash or obtain additional financing to meet our liquidity needs. If we are unable to obtain adequate financial support following the Separation, we will likely need to obtain additional financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements, or from a combination of these sources. There can be no assurance that financing alternatives will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future due to market conditions, our financial condition, our liquidity constraints, our lack of history operating as a company independent from iHeartCommunications or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Even if financing alternatives are available to us, we may not find them suitable or at comparable interest rates to the indebtedness being refinanced, and our annual cash interest payment obligations could increase further. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from securing financing on terms that are available to us at that time. Consequently, there can be no assurance that such financing, if permitted under the terms of our financing agreements, will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. The inability to obtain additional financing in such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations or pursue strategic initiatives. Additional indebtedness could increase our leverage and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nIn addition to the need to refinance our various indebtedness at or before maturity, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash through our operations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, on our ability to meet our obligations and on the value of our company following the Separation.\nWe face intense competition in the outdoor advertising business\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current advertising revenues. We compete for advertising revenue with other outdoor advertising businesses, as well as with other media, such as radio, newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, mobile devices, satellite radio and Internet-based services, within their respective markets. Market shares are subject to change for various reasons including through consolidation of our competitors through processes such as mergers and acquisitions, which could have the effect of reducing our revenue in a specific market. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It also is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of our business segments. The advertiser/agency ecosystem is diverse and dynamic, with advertiser/agency relationships subject to change. This could have an adverse effect on us if an advertiser client shifts its relationship to an agency with whom we do not have as good a relationship. An increased level of competition for advertising dollars may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match.\nThe success of our street furniture and transit products businesses is dependent on our obtaining key municipal concessions, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms\nOur street furniture and transit products businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and transit authorities. Many of these contracts, which require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal, typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy and substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids.\nOur competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not been, and most likely in the future will not be, awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, be able to renew existing contracts (on the same or better terms, or at all) or be able to replace any revenue lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts may also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity.\nThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25aa\nwe expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;\n\u25aa\nwe may be unable to estimate accurately the revenue derived from and the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win or anticipate changes in the operating environment on which our financial proposal was based; and\n\u25aa\nwe may encounter expenses and delays if our competitors challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nOur inability to successfully negotiate, renew or complete these contracts due to third-party or governmental demands and delay and the highly competitive bidding processes for these contracts could affect our ability to offer these products to our clients, or to offer them to our clients at rates that are competitive to other forms of advertising, without adversely affecting our financial results.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control\nCertain factors that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, decreasing overall revenues, the numbers of advertising customers, advertising fees or profit margins include:\n\u25aa\nunfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u25aa\nour inability to successfully adopt or our being late in adopting technological changes and innovations that offer more attractive advertising alternatives than what we offer, which could result in a loss of advertising customers or lower advertising rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance;\n\u25aa\nunfavorable shifts in population and other demographics, which may cause us to lose advertising customers as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence or which may cause advertisers to be willing to pay less in advertising fees if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective;\n\u25aa\nadverse political effects and acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts; and\n\u25aa\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions, which may impair our ability to operate or require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit of the U.K. from the E.U., commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". International outdoor is currently headquartered in the U.K. and transacts business in many key European markets. The U.K. is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union scheduled for March 29, 2019. In November 2018, the U.K. and the E.U. agreed upon a draft Withdrawal Agreement that sets out the terms of the U.K.\u2019s departure. On January 15, 2019, the draft Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the U.K. Parliament creating significant uncertainty about the terms (and timing) under which the U.K. will leave the E.U. and the consequent impact on the economies of the U.K., the E.U. and other countries. This uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce the amount they spend on advertising. Any of these or similar effects of Brexit could adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nFuture dispositions, acquisitions and other strategic transactions could pose risks\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to pursue strategic dispositions of certain businesses, as well as acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material. Dispositions and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25aa\nour dispositions may negatively impact revenues from our national, regional and other sales networks;\n\u25aa\nour dispositions may make it difficult to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements, including our debt service requirements;\n\u25aa\nour acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows;\n\u25aa\nto successfully manage our large portfolio of outdoor advertising and other businesses, we may need to:\n\u2022\nrecruit additional senior management as we cannot be assured that senior management of acquired businesses will continue to work for us and we cannot be certain that our recruiting efforts will succeed, and\n\u2022\nexpand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those of acquired businesses, because failure to do so may cause us to lose the benefits of any expansion that we decide to undertake by leading to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or by distracting our management;\n\u25aa\nwe may enter into markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u25aa\nwe may encounter difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u25aa\nour management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nDispositions and acquisitions of outdoor advertising businesses may require antitrust review by U.S. federal antitrust agencies and may require review by foreign antitrust agencies under the antitrust laws of foreign jurisdictions. We can give no assurances that the United States Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d), the FTC or foreign antitrust agencies will not seek to bar us from disposing of or acquiring outdoor advertising businesses or impose stringent undertaking on our business as a condition to the completion of an acquisition in any market where we already have a significant position.\nGovernment regulation of outdoor advertising may restrict our outdoor advertising operations\nU.S. federal, state and local regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. One of the seminal laws is the HBA, which regulates outdoor advertising on controlled roads in the United States. The HBA regulates the size and location of billboards, mandates a state compliance program, requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. Construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of billboards and the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by federal, state and local governments. From time to time, states and municipalities have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new outdoor advertising structures. Changes in laws and regulations affecting outdoor advertising, or changes in the interpretation of those laws and regulations, at any level of government, including the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could have a significant financial impact on us by requiring us to make significant expenditures or otherwise limiting or restricting some of our operations. Due to such regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to develop new outdoor advertising locations.\nFrom time to time, certain state and local governments and third parties have attempted to force the removal of our displays under various state and local laws, including zoning ordinances, permit enforcement and condemnation. Similar risks also arise in certain of our international jurisdictions. Certain zoning ordinances provide for amortization which is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Other regulations limit our ability to rebuild, replace, repair, maintain and upgrade non-conforming displays. In addition, from time to time third parties or local governments assert that we own or operate displays that either are not properly permitted or otherwise are not in strict compliance with applicable law. If we are increasingly unable to resolve such allegations or obtain acceptable arrangements in circumstances in which our displays are subject to removal, modification or amortization, or if there occurs an increase in such regulations or their enforcement, our operating results could suffer.\nA number of state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. From time to time, legislation also has been introduced in international jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. In addition, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legislation or interpreted existing legislation to restrict or prohibit the installation of digital billboards, and we expect these efforts to continue. The increased imposition of these measures, and our inability to overcome any such measures, could reduce our operating income if those outcomes require removal or restrictions on the use of preexisting displays or limit growth of digital displays. In addition, if we are unable to pass on the cost of these items to our clients, our operating income could be adversely affected.\nInternational regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations limit the subject matter, animation and language of out-of-home displays. Our failure to comply with these or any future international regulations could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our displays or their attractiveness to clients as an advertising medium and may require us to make significant expenditures to ensure compliance and avoid certain penalties or contractual breaches. As a result, we may experience a significant impact on our operations, revenue, international client base and overall financial condition.\nRegulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, or any failure to comply with these regulations, could hinder our operations\nWe utilize demographic and other information from and about consumers, business partners and advertisers that we collect directly or receive from third-party vendors. We are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to collect, use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our consumers, business partners and\nadvertisers, or to transfer employee data within the corporate group. Such restrictions could limit our ability to offer tailored advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers. Although we have implemented and are implementing policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted by the courts or regulators in ways that could harm our business. For example, any efforts required to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation, effective as of May 2018, or the new California Consumer Privacy Act, which is effective as of January 2020, may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. I n addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our consumers, business partners and advertisers, or to transfer employee data within the corporate group. Such restrictions could limit our ability to offer targeted advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers. Although we have implemented and are implementing policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, we could lose valuable information, suffer disruptions to our business, and incur expenses and liabilities including damages to our relationships with business partners and advertisers\nAlthough we have implemented physical and electronic security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets and proprietary business information as well as, consumer, business partner and advertiser personally identifiable information, no security measures are perfect and impenetrable and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations, information processes or internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed; we could lose consumers, business partners and advertisers. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer financial exposure in connection with penalties, remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings and changes in our security and system protection measures. Currently, not all of our systems are fully compliant with the new GDPR standards and, as a result, we may face additional liability in the event of a security breach. The scope of many of the requirements under the GDPR remain unclear. Future case law may determine that the steps we are taking to comply with the GDPR may not be sufficient.\nRestrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products may restrict the categories of clients that can advertise using our products\nOut-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Other products and services may be targeted in the U.S. in the future, including alcohol products. Most E.U. countries, among other nations, also have banned outdoor advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising. Localized restrictions on the location of advertising for High Fat, Salt and Sugar (\u201cHFSS\u201d) foods have been implemented in the U.K. Regulations vary across the countries in which we conduct business. Any significant reduction in advertising of products due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenues from such advertisements and an increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.\nEnvironmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations may limit or restrict some of our operations\nAs the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety as well as zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, additional laws which may be passed in the future, or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws, could require us to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict some of our operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because a portion of our revenue is received in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes\nWe generate a portion of our revenues in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions, including Brexit, in any of the foreign countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other currency restrictions being imposed. Because we receive a portion of our revenues in currencies from the countries in which we operate, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability. A portion of our cash flows are generated in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and certain of the indebtedness held by our international subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, and, therefore, significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on our indebtedness.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on our operating income as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDoing business in foreign countries exposes us to certain risks not expected to occur when doing business in the United States\nDoing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found when doing business in the United States. These risks could result in losses against which we are not insured. Examples of these risks include:\n\u25aa\npotential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;\n\u25aa\nhostility from local populations;\n\u25aa\nthe adverse effect of foreign exchange controls\n\u25aa\ngovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u25aa\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u25aa\nexpropriations of property without adequate compensation;\n\u25aa\nthe potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u25aa\nthe risk of insurrections;\n\u25aa\nrisks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u25aa\ndifficulties collecting receivables and otherwise enforcing contracts with governmental agencies and others in some foreign legal systems;\n\u25aa\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u25aa\nchanges in tax structure and level; and\n\u25aa\nchanges in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of laws or regulations.\nOur International operations involve contracts with, and regulation by, foreign governments. We operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Separation, the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and Our Relationship with iHeartCommunications\niHeartCommunications has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11, which could cause significant uncertainties and risks for our operations and our liquidity\nWe are obligated to use various corporate services provided by iHeartCommunications and its affiliates, including treasury, payroll and other financial services, certain executive officer services, human resources and employee benefit services, legal services, information systems and network services and procurement and sourcing support, pursuant to a Corporate Services Agreement. Even though we are not Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, these bankruptcy proceedings have affected our rights under the Corporate Services Agreement and the other intercompany agreements.\nPursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement, substantially all of the cash generated from our domestic Americas operations is transferred daily into accounts of iHeartCommunications (after satisfying our controlled disbursement accounts and the funding requirements of the trustee accounts under the Series A Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cSeries A CCWH Senior Notes\u201d) and Series B Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cSeries B CCWH Senior Notes\u201d and together with the Series A Senior Notes, the \u201cCCWH Senior Notes\u201d) of our subsidiary Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCCWH\u201d) and new 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due\n2024 (the \u201cNew CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d), where funds of ours and of iHeartCommunications are commingled. Prior to March 14, 2018, net amounts owed between us and iHeartCommunications were evidenced by revolving promissory notes.\nPursuant to an order entered by the Bankruptcy Court, as of March 14, 2018, the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note was frozen, and following March 14, 2018, intercompany allocations that would have been reflected in adjustments to the balance of the Due from iHeartCommunications Note are instead reflected in an intercompany balance that accrues interest at a rate equal to the interest under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. The Bankruptcy Court entered an order to allow iHeartCommunications to continue to provide the day-to-day cash management services for us during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. As of December 31, 2018, we owed $21.6 million to iHeartCommunications under this intercompany arrangement with iHeartCommunications.\nWe are an unsecured creditor of iHeartCommunications with respect to amounts owed under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note. We do not expect to recover the full balance of the now-frozen Due from iHeartCommunications Note upon the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, the iHeart Plan of Reorganization provides that we will recover 14.44%, or approximately $149.0 million, in cash on the Due From iHeartCommunications Note. The iHeart Plan of Reorganization also provides that after the Separation, iHeartCommunications will provide the iHeart Line of Credit, an unsecured revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million to us for a period of no more than three years following the effective date of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, and that we will sell CCOH Preferred Stock to third parties. If we do not receive the expected recovery under the Due from iHeartCommunications Note, or if we do not otherwise obtain sufficient supplemental liquidity as contemplated by the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, we could experience a liquidity shortfall. In addition, any repayments that we received on the Due from iHeartCommunications Note during the one-year preference period prior to the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may potentially be avoidable as a preference and subject to recovery by the iHeartCommunications bankruptcy estate, which could further exacerbate any liquidity shortfall.\nWhile the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and the Separation are pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could disrupt our business.\nAlthough we are not Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, we have experienced and may continue to experience disruption of our current plans and operations due to the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and the planned Separation, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Employees and other key personnel may have uncertainties about the effect of the proposed Separation, and those uncertainties may impact the ability to retain, recruit and hire key personnel to manage and run the business while the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases are pending and the iHeart Plan of Reorganization has not become effective. Furthermore, some of our customers and vendors may be hesitant to transact business with us following the Separation in light of uncertainties about our ability to perform following the Separation. If we are unable to reassure customers and vendors to continue transacting with us following the Separation, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe proposed Separation may also prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations.\nBecause iHeartCommunications continues to control substantially all of the total voting power of our common stock, investors will not be able to affect the outcome of a stockholder vote\nAs of December 31, 2018, iHeartCommunications indirectly owned (1) all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and (2) 10,726,917 shares of our Class A common stock, collectively representing approximately 89.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock entitles its holder to 20 votes and each share of our Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, iHeartCommunications controlled approximately 99% of the total voting power of our common stock.\nAs long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock, it will have the ability to direct the election of all members of our board of directors and, therefore, to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our incurrence of indebtedness, our issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities, our repurchase or redemption of common stock or preferred stock, if applicable, and our payment of dividends in certain situations. Similarly, iHeartCommunications has the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including the Separation. Because iHeartCommunications\u2019 interests as our controlling stockholder may differ from other stockholders\u2019 interests, actions taken by iHeartCommunications with respect to us may not be favorable to all stockholders.\nOur agreements with iHeartCommunications impose obligations on, and iHeartCommunications' financing agreements effectively impose restrictions on, our ability to finance operations and capital needs, make acquisitions and engage in other business activities\nWe have entered into a Master Agreement, a Corporate Services Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, a Trademark License Agreement and a number of other agreements with iHeartCommunications setting forth various matters governing our relationship with iHeartCommunications while it remains a significant stockholder in us (collectively, the \"Intercompany Agreements\"). These agreements allow iHeartCommunications to retain control over many aspects of our operations, in addition to iHeartCommunications' ability to control us through its controlling ownership of our common stock. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, these agreements will terminate upon the Separation. Prior to that time, or if the iHeart Plan of Reorganization does not become effective and the Settlement Agreement is terminated, we are not able to terminate these agreements or amend them in a manner we deem more favorable so long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock. iHeartCommunications' financing agreements also impose a number of restrictions on us.\nIn addition, the Master Agreement include restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u25aa\nissue any shares of capital stock or securities convertible into capital stock;\n\u25aa\nincur indebtedness;\n\u25aa\nmake certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u25aa\nrepurchase our stock;\n\u25aa\ndispose of certain assets; and\n\u25aa\nmerge or consolidate.\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, iHeartCommunications waived its right under the Master Agreement to consent to our ability to replace or refinance the 7.625% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the \u201cSeries A CCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d) and 7.625% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the \u201cSeries B CCWH Subordinated Notes and together with the Series A Subordinated Notes, the \u201cCCWH Subordinated Notes\u201d) effective immediately upon the confirmation of the iHeartMedia Plan of Reorganization, which occurred on January 22, 2019. Accordingly, we refinanced these notes on February 12, 2019 with the proceeds of new CCWH Subordinated Notes without consent from iHeartCommunications. However, this waiver did not extend to any other refinancing activity or any of the other activities listed above that we may seek to pursue prior to the Separation and therefore, the restrictions contained in these agreements continue to limit our ability to finance operations and capital needs, make acquisitions or engage in other business activities, including our ability to grow and increase our revenue or respond to competitive changes.\nWe may be unable to replace the services iHeartCommunications provides us in a timely manner or on comparable terms\nPursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement, we are obligated to use various corporate services provided by iHeartCommunications and its affiliates, including treasury, payroll and other financial services, certain executive officer services, human resources and employee benefit services, legal services, information systems and network services and procurement and sourcing support. iHeartCommunications has continued to provide these services during the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, however, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, the Corporate Services Agreement will terminate at the time of the Separation and we will enter into a Transition Services Agreement. Under the Transition Services Agreement, iHM Management Services, Inc. (\u201ciHM Management Services\u201d) will provide, or will cause an affiliate to provide, certain administrative and support services and other assistance to us, which we will utilize in the conduct of our business as such business was conducted prior to the Separation generally for one year (subject to certain rights of the Company to extend for up to an additional year). Following the Separation and the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, we will need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services we currently receive from iHM Management Services and other affiliates of iHeartCommunications. We negotiated our arrangements with iHeartCommunications in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship prior to the initial public offering of our Class A common stock and are negotiating the terms of the Transition Services Agreement in the context of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we currently receive. We may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently or may incur additional costs. If we fail to obtain the services necessary to operate effectively or if we incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Separation could result in significant tax liability to us\nThe Radio Distribution and the Separation are intended to be taxable transactions. The gain or loss recognized with respect to these transactions will depend on, among other things, (a) the value and tax basis of the assets transferred in the Radio Distribution\nand the value and tax basis of the New CCOH Common Stock on the effective date of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization (such values will be determined by reference to, among other things, the trading value of the iHeartMedia equity and New CCOH Common Stock following the effective date); (b) complex modeling considerations under certain U.S. Department of Treasury regulations; (c) the amount of cancellation of indebtedness income realized in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases; and (d) the extent to which any \u201cexcess loss accounts\u201d (as defined under applicable Treasury regulations) are taken into account. The extent to which any related taxable gain or loss will result in any cash tax liabilities will depend on whether the tax attributes of iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries, including the net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries (including us and our subsidiaries), are sufficient to offset any net taxable gain attributable to the transactions.\nBecause certain of the factors that will determine whether the Separation will give rise to any cash tax liability cannot be known until the effective date of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, we cannot say with certainty whether any such cash tax liability will be owed. To the extent the Separation does give rise to any cash tax liability, we, iHeartCommunications, iHeartMedia and various other entities would be jointly and severally liable under applicable law for any such amounts. The parties intend that the allocation of such liabilities among iHeartMedia and new CCOH will be addressed by a new tax matters agreement to be entered into on the effective date of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization.\nThe Merger is expected to, but may not, qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code\nThe parties expect the Merger to be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the obligation of each of CCH and us to effect the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of U.S. federal income tax opinions to that effect from their respective tax counsels or accounting advisors. These tax opinions represent the legal judgment of counsel or the relevant accounting advisor rendering the opinion and are not binding on the IRS or the courts. If the Merger does not qualify as a \u201creorganization,\u201d then a holder of our Class A Common Stock may be required to recognize any gain or loss with respect to the receipt of New CCOH Common Stock in the Merger. Tax matters are very complicated and the consequences of the Merger to any particular stockholder will depend on that stockholder\u2019s particular facts and circumstances. We urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences of the Merger to you.\nThe iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may give rise to unfavorable tax consequences for us\nAlthough the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries did not file Chapter 11 cases as part of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, the consummation of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may have an adverse impact on the Company and its subsidiaries. The Radio Distribution and the Separation are intended to be taxable transactions and the Merger is expected to, but may not, qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. There is a risk that the Radio Distribution and Separation will give rise to a U.S. federal income tax liability to one or more members of iHeartMedia or its subsidiaries after the Separation. If such liability were to arise, we, iHeartCommunications, iHeartMedia and various other entities would be jointly liable under applicable law for such tax liability and, while we would not anticipate that any such tax liability would be asserted against us in the first instance, we may ultimately be liable for such liability if iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries fail to satisfy such liability. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state and local income tax purposes where we filed combined, consolidated or unitary returns with iHeartMedia or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state and local income tax purposes. In addition, iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries and we and our subsidiaries may be required to reduce certain of their or our, as applicable, tax attributes, including NOLs, as a result of any cancellation of indebtedness income realized by the Debtors in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\nTransfers of our equity, issuances of equity in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, and cancellation of indebtedness income realized by the Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income NOLs carried forward from prior years. We are attributed a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforward of the iHeartMedia consolidated group. Our ability to utilize these NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our NOL carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation of a plan of reorganization in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, it is expected that we will experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Under section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, absent an application exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of federal income tax NOL carryforwards existing prior to the change that it could utilize to offset its taxable income in future taxable years generally is subject to an annual limitation to an amount equal to the value of its stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-\nexempt rate, subject to adjustments to reflect the differences between the fair market value of the corporation\u2019s assets and the tax basis in such assets and various other complex rules and adjustments. Because the value of our stock can fluctuate materially, it is possible an ownership change would materially limit our ability to utilize our substantial federal income tax NOL carry-forwards in the future. In addition, our NOLs may be subject to reduction as a result of any cancellation of indebtedness income realized by the Debtors in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize our federal income tax NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWhile we continue to be a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications, conflicts of interest may arise between iHeartCommunications and us in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us\nQuestions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between iHeartCommunications and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. iHeartCommunications is owned indirectly by iHeartMedia. Two of our directors serve as directors of iHeartMedia. Three of our other directors are affiliated with iHeartMedia and its stockholders. In addition, five of our executive officers serve as executive officers of iHeartMedia, including our CEO who also serves as the CEO of iHeartCommunications.\nAreas in which conflicts of interest between iHeartCommunications and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nCross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. The ownership interests of our directors or executive officers in the common stock of iHeartMedia or service as a director or officer of both iHeartMedia and us could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the two companies. For example, these decisions could relate to: (1) the nature, quality and cost of services rendered to us by iHeartCommunications; (2) disagreement over the desirability of a potential acquisition opportunity; (3) employee retention or recruiting; or (4) our capital structure, including our level of indebtedness and our dividend policy.\n\u2022\nIntercompany transactions. Even during the pendency of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, iHeartCommunications or its affiliates may, from time to time, enter into transactions with us or our subsidiaries or other affiliates. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between employees of iHeartCommunications and us, the independent directors on our board or a committee of disinterested directors, and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, there can be no assurance the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained in arm\u2019s length negotiations.\n\u2022\nIntercompany agreements. We have entered into certain agreements with iHeartCommunications pursuant to which it provides us certain management, administrative, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we reimburse iHeartCommunications on a cost basis. In addition, we entered into a number of intercompany agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by iHeartCommunications for certain of our businesses. Pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement between iHeartCommunications and us, we are contractually obligated to utilize the services of certain executive officers of iHeartCommunications as our executive officers until the Corporate Services Agreement is terminated in connection with the Separation and iHeartCommunications no longer owns shares of our common stock representing less than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock. The terms of these agreements were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of iHeartCommunications and were not the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations. In addition, conflicts could arise in the interpretation of these existing agreements.\nIf iHeartCommunications engages in the same type of business we conduct or takes advantage of business opportunities that might be attractive to us, our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to any contractual provision to the contrary, iHeartCommunications will have no obligation to refrain from:\n\u25aa\nengaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; or\n\u25aa\ndoing business with any of our clients, customers or vendors.\nIn addition, the corporate opportunity policy set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation addresses potential conflicts of interest between our company, on the one hand, and iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia and its officers and directors who are officers or directors of our company, on the other hand. The policy provides that if iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both iHeartCommunications and us, we will have renounced our interest in the corporate opportunity. It also provides that if one of\nour directors or officers who is also a director or officer of iHeartCommunications or iHeartMedia learns of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both iHeartCommunications and us, (1) we will have renounced our interest in the corporate opportunity, unless that opportunity is expressly offered to that person in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer, and (2) the director or officer will have no duty to communicate or present that corporate opportunity to us and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty by reason of iHeartCommunications\u2019 actions with respect to that corporate opportunity.\nThis policy could result in iHeartCommunications having rights to corporate opportunities in which both we and iHeartCommunications have an interest.\nWe may be more susceptible to adverse events as a result of the Separation\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. By separating from iHeartMedia, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and have less leverage with suppliers, and we may experience other adverse events. The completion of the Separation will also require significant amounts of our management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our business.\nThe Separation will result in changes in CCOH\u2019s management team and may result in the loss of other key employees\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of our management team and other key individuals. Five of our executive officers currently serve as executive officers of iHeartMedia, including our CEO and CFO, who serve as the CEO and CFO of iHeartMedia, respectively. These executive officers have historically provided services to us pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement, which will be terminated upon consummation of the Separation. Effective upon the Separation, we have announced that William Eccleshare is expected to become our CEO and a member of our board of directors. Brian Coleman is expected to become our CFO and Lynn Feldman is expected to become our EVP and General Counsel. Mr. Eccleshare currently serves as Chairman and CEO of Clear Channel International, Mr. Coleman currently serves as our SVP and Treasurer and Ms. Feldman currently serves as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary for Clear Channel Outdoor Americas. Even though we have been able to identify these individuals, we will need to identify replacements for other key positions. Competition for these key individuals is intense. In addition, many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no obligation to remain with us and may decide to leave as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the business following the Separation or for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. If members of our management or key individuals decide to leave in the future, if we decide to make further changes to the composition of, or the roles and responsibilities of, these individuals, or if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining other key employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nUpon completion of the Separation, the composition of our board of directors will be different than the current composition of our board of directors\nIn connection with the Separation, members of our board of directors will be replaced with new members selected by a committee consisting of certain holders of interests and creditors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases. Our new board of directors will not have the same level of experience with our historical operations as our current board. Our new board of directors may pursue business plans and growth strategies that differ from our existing business plans and growth strategies. Any new business plans or growth strategies implemented by the new board of directors, including plans to address our capital structure and reduce our leverage, if unsuccessful, may lead to material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships, and an adverse impact on operations and financial results.\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results\nOur historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent public company not controlled by iHeartMedia during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future.\nPrior to the Separation, we operate as part of iHeartMedia\u2019s broader corporate organization, and subsidiaries of iHeartMedia perform various corporate functions for us. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from iHeartMedia for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent publicly-traded company.\nOur historical financial information does not reflect changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of the Separation from iHeartMedia, including changes in our capital structure, tax structure and new personnel needs. As part of iHeartMedia, we enjoyed certain benefits from iHeartMedia\u2019s operating diversity, size and purchasing power and we will lose\nthese benefits after the Separation. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods or services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of iHeartMedia prior to the Separation.\nFollowing the Separation, we will also be responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. In addition, certain costs incurred by subsidiaries of iHeartMedia, including executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, occupancy, procurement, information technology and other shared services, have historically been allocated to us by iHeartMedia; but these allocations may not reflect the future level of these costs to us as we begin to provide these services ourselves. Therefore, our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent publicly-traded company. We cannot assure you that our operating results will continue at a similar level when we are an independent publicly-traded company.\nWe are currently a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules but we are not expected to retain that status following the Separation. However, during the phase-in period we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nBecause iHeartCommunications currently controls a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock, we have been a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE corporate governance listing standards. Under the NYSE Listing Rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u25aa\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors\n\u25aa\nthe nominating and governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u25aa\nthe compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities\nAccordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nFollowing the Separation, iHeartCommunications will cease to control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock. Accordingly, if the Separation is consummated, we are not expected to continue to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE Listing Rules. Under NYSE Listing Rules, a company that ceases to be a controlled company must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees on the following phase-in schedule: (1) one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company; (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company; and (3) all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company. Additionally, the NYSE Listing Rules provide a 12-month phase-in period from the date a company ceases to be a controlled company to comply with the majority independent board requirement. During these phase-in periods, holders of New CCOH Common Stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies of which the majority of directors are independent. Additionally, if, within the phase-in periods, we are not able to recruit additional directors who would qualify as independent, or otherwise comply with NYSE Listing Rules, we may be subject to delisting procedures by the NYSE. Furthermore, a change in the board of directors and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operation philosophies and may result in deviations from our current strategies or from the strategies established by our board of directors following the Separation.\nWe currently do not have control over our tax decisions and could be liable for income taxes owed by iHeartCommunications\nUntil the Separation occurs, we and certain of our subsidiaries will be included in the iHeartMedia consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes for all pre-merger periods and the CCH consolidated group for post-merger periods. In addition, we or one or more of our subsidiaries may be included in the combined, consolidated, or unitary tax returns of iHeartMedia for pre-Merger periods and CCH for post-Merger periods or one or more of its subsidiaries for foreign, state and local income tax purposes. Under the existing Tax Matters Agreement, we pay to iHeartCommunications the amount of federal, foreign, state and local income taxes that we would be required to pay to the relevant taxing authorities if we and our subsidiaries filed combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns and were not included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of iHeartMedia or its subsidiaries. In addition, by virtue of its controlling ownership and the existing Tax Matters Agreement, iHeartCommunications effectively controls all of our tax decisions. The existing Tax Matters Agreement provides that iHeartCommunications has the sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to us, to file all income tax returns on\nour behalf and to determine the amount of our liability to (or entitlement to payment from) iHeartCommunications under the existing Tax Matters Agreement. This arrangement may result in conflicts of interest between iHeartCommunications and us. For example, under the existing Tax Matters Agreement, iHeartCommunications is able to choose to contest, compromise, or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to iHeartCommunications and detrimental to us. Following the Separation, we will become party to a new tax matters agreement with iHeartMedia, which will provide for the allocation of rights, obligations, and potential liabilities among us and iHeartMedia, including with respect to control of audits and tax controversies, the filing of tax returns for the pre- and post-Separation periods, allocation of liabilities both related and unrelated to the Separation, and various other matters.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the Tax Matters Agreement, federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group\u2019s entire tax obligation. Thus, to the extent iHeartMedia or other members of the group fail to make any United States federal income tax payments required by law, we would be liable for the shortfall. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state and local income tax purposes where we file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with iHeartMedia or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state and local income tax purposes.\nSome of our contracts contain provisions requiring the consent of third parties in connection with the Merger or the Separation. If these consents are not obtained, the contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nSome of our contracts, including certain contracts with municipalities and transit authorities, contain provisions that require the consent of certain third parties to the Merger or the Separation. Failure to obtain consents on commercially reasonable and satisfactory terms may result in the termination of the contracts, the need to renegotiate or amend the contracts or legal action to determine the obligations of the parties. We may not be able to replace some or all of the revenue lost upon the termination of a contract, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed\nThe closing of the Merger of the Company with and into CCH is subject to a number of conditions, many of which are not within CCH\u2019s or our control, and failure to satisfy such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Separation. The conditions include (i) (x) the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of the shares representing the majority of the voting power of our common stock to adopt the merger agreement, to approve the Merger and to approve the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and (y) the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of shares of CCH common stock entitled to vote to adopt the merger agreement, to approve the Merger and to approve the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) no order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, stipulation, determination or award entered by or with any governmental authority or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be in effect, (iii) the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the shares of New CCOH Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, (iv) a period of at least 20 calendar days will have elapsed from the date the information statement/prospectus with respect to the Separation is first mailed to our stockholders, (v) the approval of the merger agreement by the Bankruptcy Court (which may be included in the order confirming the iHeart Plan of Reorganization), (vi) the Radio Distribution and certain distributions of our common stock have occurred, (vii) the conversion of all outstanding shares of our Class B common stock held by CCH into shares of Class A common stock will have occurred, (viii) that, as a condition to CCH\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger, CCH will have received a tax opinion issued by its tax counsel or another tax advisor, (ix) that, as a condition to our obligation to consummate the Merger, we will have received a tax opinion issued by our tax counsel or another tax advisor, (x) the approval by the NYSE for listing of the New CCOH Common Stock, (xi) all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization will have been satisfied prior to or contemporaneously with the closing of the Merger and (xii) other customary conditions.\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied. If any event occurs delaying or preventing the Separation, such delay or failure to complete the Separation may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial performance and operating results and the price per share for our common stock. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe distribution of our shares held by iHeartCommunications at the consummation of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization as well as sales by subsequent holders could depress the market price for shares of our common stock\nThe iHeart Plan of Reorganization contemplates that the shares of our common stock held by iHeartCommunications will be distributed to certain holders of claims in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases at the conclusion of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.\nAccordingly, unless the iHeart Plan of Reorganization does not become effective, iHeartCommunications will not maintain its ownership of our common stock. Holders of claims in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases receiving New CCOH Common Stock pursuant to the iHeartMedia Plan of Reorganization (other than recipients that are our affiliates) generally may sell those shares immediately in the public market. It is likely that some of these holders will sell such New CCOH Common Stock if, for reasons such as its business profile or market capitalization as an independent company, stock of New CCOH does not fit their investment objectives, or, in the case of index funds, New CCOH is not a participant in the index in which they are investing. The distribution of our shares by iHeartCommunications as well as subsequent sales of significant amounts of New CCOH Common Stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may decrease the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, uncertainties caused by the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, including timing and consummation of the Separation, may cause investors to perceive disadvantages in owning our Class A common stock, which may also result in a decline of market prices.\nWe currently do not pay regularly-scheduled dividends on our Class A common stock\nIn the past, we have paid certain special dividends but we do not pay regularly-scheduled dividends and are subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends should we seek to do so in the future, including with respect to the New CCOH Common Stock after the Separation. We are a holding company with no independent operations and no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. We, therefore, are dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, the CCWH Senior Notes and the New CCWH Subordinated Notes contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. If we elect not to pay dividends in the future or are prevented from doing so, including after the Separation, the price of our Class A common stock, or New CCOH Common Stock following the Separation, must appreciate in order to realize a gain on your investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nIn the event the Separation is not completed, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results may be negatively impacted\nThe conditions to the completion of the Separation may not be satisfied, and the Separation may not be completed. If the Separation is not completed for any reason, we may be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25aa\nthe failure to consummate the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, which failure will lead to continued uncertainty for us;\n\u25aa\nthe focus of iHeartMedia\u2019s and the Company\u2019s management having been diverted from seeking other potential opportunities without realizing any benefits of the Separation;\n\u25aa\nnegative reactions from our customers, suppliers, regulators and employees; and\n\u25aa\nthe price of our Class A common stock declining significantly from current market prices, to the extent that current market prices may reflect a market assumption that the Separation will be completed.\nIf the Separation is not completed, the risks described above may materialize and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.\nThe market price of the New CCOH Common Stock may decline compared to the historical market price of our Class A common stock as a result of the Separation and related transactions\nThe market price of the New CCOH Common Stock may decline compared to the historical market price of our Class A common stock as a result of the Separation and related transactions if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Separation as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts, or the effect of the Separation on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nThe holders of CCOH Preferred Stock will have rights that are senior to the rights of a holder of New CCOH Common Stock\nAs part of the Separation, we will issue the CCOH Preferred Stock to third party investors. Although the terms of the CCOH Preferred Stock have yet to be fully negotiated, the CCOH Preferred Stock is expected to provide that, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of CCOH Preferred Stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of New CCOH Common Stock. As a result of the CCOH Preferred Stock\u2019s superior rights relative to the New CCOH Common Stock, the right of holders of New CCOH Common Stock to receive distributions from us may be diluted and may be limited by such rights.\nOur stock ownership by iHeartCommunications, provisions in our agreements with iHeartCommunications and our corporate governance documents, Delaware law and the Chapter 11 Cases may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that our other stockholders may consider favorable, which could decrease the value of your shares of Class A common stock\nAs long as iHeartCommunications continues to own shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock, it will have the ability to control decisions regarding an acquisition of us by a third party. As a controlled company, we are exempt from some of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the requirement that our board of directors consist of a majority of independent directors. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors, supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents, restrictions on a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent. Some of these provisions, such as the limitation on stockholder action by written consent, only become effective once iHeartCommunications no longer controls us. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Delaware law also imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These restrictions under Delaware law do not apply to iHeartCommunications while it retains at least 15% or more of our Class B common stock. Although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. As a result of the filing of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, iHeartCommunications is operating as a \u201cdebtor-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, and any acquisition of us by a third party would also require the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.3 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, including: (1) $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of CCWH Senior Notes, net of unamortized discounts of $3.4 million, which mature in November 2022; (2) $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of CCWH Subordinated Notes, which were scheduled to mature in March 2020 prior to their redemption in 2019; (3) $377.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of international subsidiary senior notes, net of unamortized premiums of $2.7 million, which mature in December 2020; and (4) $3.9 million of other debt. On February 12, 2019, CCWH refinanced its CCWH Subordinated Notes, which were scheduled to mature in March 2020, with an aggregate principal amount of $2,235 million of New CCWH Subordinated Notes, which mature in February 2024.\nThis large amount of indebtedness could have negative consequences for us, including, without limitation:\n\u25aa\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing cash available for other purposes, including to fund operations and capital expenditures, invest in new technology and pursue other business opportunities;\n\u25aa\nlimiting our liquidity and operational flexibility and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u25aa\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u25aa\nrequiring us to defer planned capital expenditures, reduce discretionary spending, sell assets, restructure existing indebtedness or defer acquisitions or other strategic opportunities;\n\u25aa\nlimiting our ability to refinance any of the indebtedness or increasing the cost of any such financing;\n\u25aa\nmaking us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance, a decline in general economic or industry conditions or a disruption in the credit markets; and\n\u25aa\nmaking us more susceptible to negative changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nIf compliance with the debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Furthermore, these actions may not be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements.\nOur ability to refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and increase our debt service obligations and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our operations and our ability to successfully refinance or extend our debt may also be negatively affected by the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and the Separation. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness we will be in default under one or more of our debt agreements and, as a result we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nBecause we derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries, our ability to repay our debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to dividend or distribute funds to us\nWe derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and the ability to service our indebtedness depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and the ability of those entities to distribute funds to us. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay to us the amounts necessary to service our debt.\nThe documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business\nOur material financing agreements contain various covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25aa\nmake acquisitions or investments;\n\u25aa\nmake loans or otherwise extend credit to others;\n\u25aa\nincur indebtedness or issue shares or guarantees;\n\u25aa\nredeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt;\n\u25aa\ncreate liens;\n\u25aa\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25aa\nsell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets;\n\u25aa\nmerge or consolidate with other companies; and\n\u25aa\nmake a substantial change to the general nature of our business.\nThese restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness and, as a result, we would be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, limit our financing options, reduce our flexibility under future financings and adversely affect our liquidity, and also may adversely impact our business operations\nOur corporate credit ratings are speculative-grade. Our corporate credit ratings and ratings outlook are subject to review by rating agencies from time to time and, on various occasions, have been downgraded. In the future, our corporate credit rating and rating outlook could be further downgraded. Any further reductions in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, reduce the availability of financing to us or increase the cost of doing business or otherwise negatively impact our business operations.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
