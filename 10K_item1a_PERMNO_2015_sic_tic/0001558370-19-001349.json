RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nOur operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile over the past few years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and reached a near ten-year low of $26 per barrel in February 2016. Oil prices began to stabilize during 2017 and steadily increased throughout much of 2018, hitting a four-year high of $76 per barrel in September. However, during the fourth quarter of 2018, oil prices declined dramatically to a low of $42 per barrel. Declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and OPEC+, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by more expensive production sources to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas.\nLower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Additionally, these circumstances could indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value, which could result in a future goodwill impairment. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.\nOur customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.\nChanges in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain at the current relatively low levels or decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience\ndifficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the world wide economy, undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity, especially in low oil price environments. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures. Our ability to continually provide technologically competitive drilling-related equipment and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could adversely impact our ability to compete. Another key factor in job award determinations is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.\nOur ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers\u2019 future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including environmental and weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling and workover industries, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may\nchoose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.\nMost of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. The downturn in the oil price environment resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers\u2019 ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle rigs.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $46.1 million, $6.9 million and $245.2 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet.\nThe loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received approximately 41%, 45% and 46%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 24%, 29% and 33% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them.\nThe profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.\nWe derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.\nFor example, we are exposed to risks related to political instability in Venezuela. On January 28, 2019, the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (\u201cPdVSA\u201d) as a Specially Designated National under Executive Order 13850 (the \u201cOrder\u201d). The Order prohibited, among other things, business dealings with PdVSA or any entity in which PdVSA owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. As of December 31, 2018, Nabors operated four rigs in Venezuela, under contracts with Chevron and two joint ventures that are majority-owned by PdVSA, Petrobosc\u00e1n and Petrocede\u00f1o. The political uncertainty and civil unrest in Venezuela could have a significant impact on our operations there, including the risk that one or more of our rigs could be nationalized by the government or that we will not be paid for our services. Nabors continues to evaluate the potential impact of these developments on its business and operations in Venezuela.\nTo the extent that any of these risks arising from our operations in global markets are realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3.6 billion in outstanding debt, resulting in a gross debt to capital ratio of 0.57:1, a net debt to capital ratio of 0.53:1 and an asset to debt coverage ratio of approximately 3.82:1.\nAvailability under both the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a covenant not to exceed a net debt to capital ratio of 0.60:1. In addition, availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a covenant to maintain an asset to debt coverage ratio of at least 2.50:1. The gross debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by total capitalization (total debt plus shareholders\u2019 equity). The net debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing net debt (total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) by net capitalization (net debt plus shareholders\u2019 equity). The asset to debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing (x) drilling-related fixed assets wholly owned by the 2018 Revolver Guarantors or wholly owned subsidiaries of the 2018 Revolver Guarantors by (y) total debt of the 2018 Revolver Guarantors (subject to certain exclusions). The asset to debt coverage ratio applies only during any period which Nabors Delaware fails to maintain an investment grade rating from at least two ratings agencies. The gross debt to capital ratio, the net debt to capital ratio and the asset to debt coverage ratio are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The gross debt to capital ratio and the net debt to capital ratio are methods for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we would have been able to borrow $1.267 billion in aggregate under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $496.25 million in aggregate under our 2012 Revolving Credit Facility, in each case subject to compliance with the conditions and covenants contained therein, including compliance with applicable financial ratios.\nWe also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries\u2019 operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively impact our stock price or financial condition.\nOur ability to access capital markets could be limited.\nFrom time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and others also are considered by the rating agencies. The major U.S. credit rating agencies have downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non-investment grade. These and further ratings downgrades may impact our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist and a generally accepted market replacement is not available, we may need to renegotiate the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and may not able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.\nWe operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (\u2018\u2018OECD\u2019\u2019) published a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan in July 2013, seeking to reform the taxation of multinational companies. The recommendations made by the OECD may result in unilateral, uncoordinated changes in tax laws in the countries in which we operate or are organized, which may result in double taxation or otherwise increase our tax liabilities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (H.R. 1), adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the new law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, the deductibility of net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the benefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material impact on our 2018 financial statements, if these tax laws, treaties\nor regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $578.0 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more \u201c5 percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company\u2019s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.\nChanges to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDrilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those regulating the transport, storage, use, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes and materials. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs.\nIn addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks.\nThe expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u2018\u2018EPA\u2019\u2019) has promulgated final rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In June 2016, the EPA published final standards to reduce methane emissions for certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas industry but, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the June 2016 standards. The requirements of the June 2016 standards currently remain in effect, pending the EPA taking final action on its proposed two-year stay, which will likely be promptly challenged. In October 2018, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would reconsider limits on methane emissions set by the June 2016 standards and reduce inspection and repair requirements.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u2018\u2018RCRA\u2019\u2019) and instead, are regulated under RCRA\u2019s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency\u2019s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a Consent Decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the Consent Decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any reclassification of such wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes could result in more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and other climate changes. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeastern United States, which establishes greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have been or may be adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In December 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France finalized an agreement, referred to as the \u201cParis Agreement\u2019, requiring member countries to review and \u2018\u2018represent a progression\u2019\u2019 in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020, including pledges to voluntarily limit or make future greenhouse gas emissions. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in 2016 but formally withdrew in August 2017. The withdrawal will take effect in November 2020. Several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal.\nIn addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which could lead to further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. Although in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (\u2018\u2018BLM\u2019\u2019) issued a rule requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands, the BLM rescinded the rule in September 2018. Several states have sued the BLM seeking to restore the November 2016 rule, and other states may regulate methane emissions by state law. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.\nAdditionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively impacted by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u2018\u2018FCPA\u2019\u2019) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs meant to ensure compliance, we cannot be sure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from violations of these laws. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.\nCompanies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:\n\u00b7\nAuthorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;\n\u00b7\nLimiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;\n\u00b7\nProhibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;\n\u00b7\nRequiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u00b7\nReserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.\nCertain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board, we did not renew our shareholder rights plan when it expired in July 2016, and in 2017 we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates recommended by shareholders. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, may deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.\nLegal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions, including claims related to our acquisition of Tesco. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See \u2018\u2018Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u2019\u2019 for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks.\nOur operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:\n\u00b7\ntheft or misappropriation of funds;\n\u00b7\nloss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);\n\u00b7\ndisruption or impairment of our and our customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures;\n\u00b7\ndamage to our reputation with our customers and the market;\n\u00b7\nexposure to litigation;\n\u00b7\nloss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and\n\u00b7\nincreased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time.\nWe do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nThere have been ongoing discussions and commentary regarding potential significant changes to the United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the \u201cUSTR\u201d) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China. In September 2018, the USTR enacted another tariff on the import of other Chinese products with an additional combined import value of approximately $200 billion. The tariff became effective on September 24, 2018, with an initial rate of 10%, with the potential for significant increases if the U.S. and China do not reach a new trade deal in the near term. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on Chinese imports and any related counter-measures that are taken by China could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might create forecasting difficulties for us and cause our customers and business partners to place fewer orders for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy around the world. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China and the United States and relative uncertainty with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December, 2017. The success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner\u2019s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling units and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.\nWe also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We are still attempting to obtain certain regulatory approvals related to the Tesco acquisition, and may not be able to do so in certain jurisdictions.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.\nThe successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement with us. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant issuances of common shares or exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nAs of February 21, 2019, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 411,592,178 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 52,800,203 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 17,352,792 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans, 31,997,773 common shares were reserved for issuance upon exchange of outstanding Exchangeable Notes , and 37,096,700 common shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding mandatory convertible preferred shares. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of Exchangeable Notes or the conversion of mandatory convertible preferred shares for common shares, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nOur common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7\nvariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\ndeviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance;\n\u00b7\nvariability in our revenues;\n\u00b7\nour announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u00b7\ngeneral conditions in the oil and gas industry;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty about current global economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in stock market price and volume; and\n\u00b7\nother general economic conditions.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.\nDuring 2018, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $8.87 per common share to a low of $1.81 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.\nAs a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to Nabors in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or\nprohibit these types of upstream payments to Nabors. Nabors\u2019 debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries\u2019 jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.", "PERMNO": 29102, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "NBR"}
