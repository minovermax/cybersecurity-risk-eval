RISK FACTORS\nInvestment in our common stock involves significant risk. You should carefully consider the information described in the following risk factors, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the events or circumstances described in these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe need substantial additional funding before we can complete the development of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain such additional capital, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and may not have the capital required to otherwise operate our business.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products, including conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and establishing manufacturing capabilities, is expensive. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash resources totaling approximately $8.0 million, plus approximately $3.0 million restricted cash in loans for our ALLSTAR clinical trial. We have not generated any product revenues, and will not be able to generate any product revenues until, and only if, we receive approval to sell our drug candidates from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates.\nFrom inception, we have financed our operations through public and private sales of our equity and debt securities, National Institutes of Health, or NIH, grants, and a CIRM loan award. In December 2013 we also entered into a collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, which provides for funding for the collaboration of our cell therapy program for cardiovascular applications, including CAP-1002. As we have not generated any revenue from operations to date, and we do not expect to generate revenue for several years, if ever, we will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to fund our general corporate activities and, thereafter, to fund our research and development, including our long-term plans for clinical trials and new product development.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to develop Cenderitide and potentially initiate clinical development of CU-NP. Our research and development expenses will also increase as we further the development of our exosomes program and conduct additional studies with CAP-1002, such as an additional clinical trial for the DYNAMIC study and the potential study of DMD. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if the FDA requires that we perform additional studies beyond those that we currently anticipate, which may also delay the timing of any potential product approval. Other than our cash on hand, we currently have no commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund the research and development of Cenderitide, CU-NP, exosomes or CAP-1002 for DMD or any further DYNAMIC studies. We commenced a new clinical trial testing our Cenderitide product candidate in January 2015 and commenced our DYNAMIC Phase I clinical trial in December 2014.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. Moreover, to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur forecasts regarding our beliefs of the sufficiency of our financial resources to support our current and planned operations are forward-looking statements and involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the scope, rate of progress, cost and results of our research and development activities, especially our Phase II clinical trial of CAP-1002, our DYNAMIC trial, our Cenderitide trial, our planned exosomes program and our planned development of CAP-1002 as a potential treatment of DMD;\n\u00b7 the continued availability of funding from NIH and CIRM;\n\u00b7 the costs of developing adequate manufacturing processes and facilities;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7 the terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7 the cost and timing of completion of clinical and commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities; and\n\u00b7 the costs of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nWe have a history of net losses, and we expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, a number of factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nWe have a history of net losses, expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing our technology, and undertaking pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. Specifically, our financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to -quarter and year-to -year in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u00b7 our need for substantial additional capital to fund our development programs;\n\u00b7 delays in the commencement, enrollment, and timing of clinical testing;\n\u00b7 the success of the ALLSTAR, DYNAMIC and Cenderitide clinical trials through all stages of clinical development;\n\u00b7 the success of clinical trials of our CU-NP product candidate through all stages of clinical development, if commenced;\n\u00b7 the viability of exosomes as a potential product candidate and the success of all stages of its pre-clinical and clinical development;\n\u00b7 the viability of CAP-1002 as a potential product candidate for the treatment of DMD and the success of all stages of its pre-clinical and clinical development;\n\u00b7 any delays in regulatory review and approval of our product candidates in clinical development;\n\u00b7 our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, within and outside the United States;\n\u00b7 potential side effects of our current or future products and product candidates that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved treatment drug to be taken off the market;\n\u00b7 regulatory difficulties relating to products that have already received regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure once our products are commercialized;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u00b7 our ability and third parties\u2019 abilities to protect intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u00b7 guidelines and recommendations of therapies published by various organizations;\n\u00b7 the ability of patients to obtain coverage of or sufficient reimbursement for our products;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain adequate insurance policies;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully manufacture our product candidates on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 our dependency on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain our current manufacturing facility and secure other facilities as determined to be necessary;\n\u00b7 costs related to and outcomes of potential intellectual property litigation;\n\u00b7 compliance with obligations under intellectual property licenses with third parties;\n\u00b7 our ability to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our ability to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u00b7 our ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u00b7 our ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively; and\n\u00b7 the ability of our senior management who have limited experience in managing a public company to manage our business and operations.\nThe Company\u2019s technology is not yet proven and each of our product candidates is in an early stage of development.\nEach of the Company\u2019s six product candidates, CAP-1002, CAP-1001, cardiospheres, exosomes, Cenderitide and CU-NP, is in an early stage of development and requires extensive clinical testing before it may be approved by the FDA, or another regulatory authority in a jurisdiction outside the United States, which could take several years to complete, if ever. The effectiveness of the Company\u2019s technology has not been definitively proven in completed human clinical trials or preclinical studies. The Company\u2019s failure to establish the efficacy of its technology would have a material adverse effect on the Company. We cannot predict with any certainty the results of such clinical testing, including the results of our ALLSTAR trial, our DYNAMIC trial, or our Cenderitide trial. We cannot predict with any certainty if, or when, we might commence any clinical trials of our product candidates other than the ALLSTAR trial, the DYNAMIC trial and the Cenderitide trial or whether such trials will yield sufficient data to permit us to proceed with additional clinical development and ultimately submit an application for regulatory approval of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, or whether such applications will be accepted by the appropriate regulatory agency.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth.\nShould we achieve our near-term milestones, of which no assurance can be given, our long-term viability will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage this growth, we may need to expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business would be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Clinical and Commercialization Activities\nOur product candidates will require substantial time and resources in order to be developed, and there is no guarantee that we will develop them successfully.\nWe have not completed the development of any products and may not have products to sell commercially for many years, if at all. Our potential products will require substantial additional research and development time and expense, as well as extensive clinical trials and perhaps additional preclinical testing, prior to commercialization, which may never occur. There can be no assurance that products will be developed successfully, perform in the manner anticipated, or be commercially viable.\nOur success depends upon the viability of our product candidates and we cannot be certain any of them will receive regulatory approval to be commercialized.\nWe will need FDA approval to market and sell any of our product candidates in the United States and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates, we must submit to the FDA a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as pre-clinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate, and requires substantial resources for research, development, and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation, administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs, as applicable. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will reduce our number of salable products and, therefore, corresponding product revenues, and will have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nThe Company has limited experience in conducting clinical trials.\nThe Company has limited human clinical trial experience with respect to its product candidates. The clinical testing process is governed by stringent regulation and is highly complex, costly, time-consuming, and uncertain as to outcome (and pharmaceutical products and products used in the regeneration of tissue may invite particularly close scrutiny and requirements from the FDA and other regulatory bodies). Our failure or the failure of our collaborators to conduct human clinical trials successfully or our failure to capitalize on the results of human clinical trials for our product candidates would have a material adverse effect on the Company. If our clinical trials of our product candidates or future product candidates do not sufficiently enroll or produce results necessary to support regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere, or if they show undesirable side effects, we will be unable to commercialize these product candidates.\nTo receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in humans. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing. In addition, the results of our clinical trials may show that our product candidates are ineffective or may cause undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, negative or inconclusive results may result in:\n\u00b7 the withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 the termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7 loss of revenues; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment, and completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by the Company, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors. The commencement and completion of clinical trials requires us to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our product candidates, may be required to withdraw from a clinical trial as a result of changing standards of care, or may become ineligible to participate in clinical studies. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, delays related to:\n\u00b7 findings in preclinical studies;\n\u00b7 reaching agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7 obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial, or being required to conduct additional trials before moving on to the next phase of trials;\n\u00b7 obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at numerous prospective sites;\n\u00b7 recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including size of patient population, nature of trial protocol, meeting the enrollment criteria for our studies, screening failures, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications;\n\u00b7 retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to the treatment protocol, lack of efficacy, personal issues, or side effects from the therapy, or who are lost to further follow-up;\n\u00b7 manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 complying with design protocols of any applicable special protocol assessment we receive from the FDA;\n\u00b7 severe or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 collecting, analyzing and reporting final data from the clinical trials;\n\u00b7 breaches in quality of manufacturing runs that compromise all or some of the doses made, positive results in FDA-required viral testing; karyotypic abnormalities in our cell product, or contamination in our manufacturing facilities, all of which events would necessitate disposal of all cells made from that source;\n\u00b7 availability of materials provided by third parties necessary to manufacture our product candidates;\n\u00b7 availability of adequate amounts of acceptable tissue for preparation of master cell banks for our products;\n\u00b7 our inability to find a tissue source with an HLA haplotype that is compatible with the recipient may lead to limited utility of the product in a broad population; and\n\u00b7 requirements to conduct additional trials and studies, and increased expenses associated with the services of the Company\u2019s CROs and other third parties.\nIn addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, we or our development partners, if any, may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for these product candidates. We may not be able to obtain approval for indications that are as broad as intended, or we may be able to obtain approval only for indications that are entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards, or IRBs, for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing, or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we are able to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, other therapies for the same or similar indications may have been introduced to the market and established a competitive advantage. Any delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u00b7 delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u00b7 impose costly procedures on us; or\n\u00b7 diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nAs the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, including our ALLSTAR clinical trial of CAP-1002, we cannot be certain that their results will support the claims of our product candidates. Positive results in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials do not ensure that results from later clinical trials will also be positive, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase III clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nOur clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the filing of our NDAs and/or BLAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials to date involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nDespite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for our product candidates, we do not know whether any Phase II, Phase III or other clinical programs we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nOur products face a risk of failure due to adverse immunological reactions.\nA potential risk of an allogeneic therapy such as that being tested by the Company with CAP-1002 is that patients might develop an immune response to the cells being infused. Such an immune response may induce adverse clinical effects which would impact the safety of the Company\u2019s products and the success of our trials. Additionally, if research subjects have pre-existing antibodies or other immune sensitization to our cells, there is a potentiality that our cells and the therapy would be rendered ineffective.\nOur business faces significant government regulation, and there is no guarantee that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval.\nOur research and development activities, preclinical studies, anticipated human clinical trials, and anticipated manufacturing and marketing of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States, as well as by regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological products or as combination biological products/medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other statutes, as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations. Different regulatory requirements may apply to our products depending on how they are categorized by the FDA under these laws. These regulations can be subject to substantial and significant interpretation, addition, amendment or revision by the FDA and by the legislative process. The FDA may determine that we will need to undertake clinical trials beyond those currently planned. Furthermore, the FDA may determine that results of clinical trials do not support approval for the product. Similar determinations may be encountered in foreign countries. The FDA will continue to monitor products in the market after approval, if any, and may determine to withdraw its approval or otherwise seriously affect the marketing efforts for any such product. The same possibilities exist for trials to be conducted outside of the United States that are subject to regulations established by local authorities and local law. Any such determinations would delay or deny the introduction of our product candidates to the market and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, other federal agencies and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices or GMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Other risks include:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or require us to take our approved products off the market;\n\u00b7 we may be required to change the way the product is manufactured or administered and we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products;\n\u00b7 we may have limitations on how we promote our products; and\n\u00b7 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the United States, we may never receive approval or commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States. In order to market and commercialize any product candidate outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. For example, European regulatory authorities generally require a trial comparing the efficacy of the new drug to an existing drug prior or subsequent to granting approval. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. Such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on product sales and potential royalties, and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if United States regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. Given the number of recent high-profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk management programs which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. Furthermore, heightened Congressional scrutiny on the adequacy of the FDA\u2019s drug approval process and the agency\u2019s efforts to assure the safety of marketed drugs has resulted in the proposal of new legislation addressing drug safety issues. If enacted, any new legislation could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials, and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance with any new post-approval regulatory requirements. Any of these restrictions or requirements could force us to conduct costly studies or increase the time for us to become profitable. For example, any labeling approved for any of our product candidates may include a restriction on the term of its use, or it may not include one or more of our intended indications.\nOur product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information on the drug. In addition, approved products, manufacturers, and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are subject to continuous review and periodic inspections. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as current Good Manufacturing Practices or GMPs, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 issue warning letters;\n\u00b7 require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions, and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7 impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 suspend regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u00b7 impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7 seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nWe have limited manufacturing capability, and may not be able to maintain our manufacturing licenses.\nWe presently maintain our laboratories and research facilities in leased premises at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, or CSMC. We presently manufacture our cells in a facility which is owned by and located within CSMC and in which we follow GMP practices. Our intention is to manufacture cells at this facility for our ALLSTAR Phase II trial, our planned DYNAMIC trial, and for any clinical work involving CAP-1002 as a potential treatment for DMD. We also intend to utilize our premises at CSMC to develop and manufacture exosomes. If the lease is terminated or if CSMC revokes its permission to allow us to utilize the manufacturing facility, we would have to secure alternative facilities in which to operate our research and development activities and/or manufacture our products, which would involve a significant monetary investment and would negatively impact the progress of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, we may have to build out our own manufacturing facility for any Phase III trial or establish a collaboration agreement with a third party.\nWe are required to obtain and maintain certain licenses in connection with our manufacturing facilities and activities. We have been issued a Manufacturing License and a Tissue Bank License from the State of California. There is no guarantee that any licenses issued to us will not be revoked or forfeited by operation of law or otherwise. If we were denied any required license or if any of our licenses were to be revoked or forfeited, we would suffer significant harm. Additionally, if a serious adverse event in any of our clinical trials was to occur during the period in which any required license was not in place, we could be exposed to additional liability if it were determined that the event was due to our fault and we had not secured the required license. Other states may impose additional licensing requirements upon us which, until obtained, would limit our ability to conduct our trials in such states.\nWe obtain the donor hearts from which our CDCs are manufactured from organ procurement organizations, or OPOs. There is no guarantee that the OPOs which currently provide donor hearts to us will be able to continue to supply us with donor hearts in the future or that an alternative OPO will be available to us. If those OPOs or an alternative OPO is not able or willing to supply us with donor hearts, we would be unable to produce our CDCs and the development of our lead product candidate would be significantly impaired and possibly terminated. Additionally, OPOs are subject to regulations of various government agencies. There is no guarantee that laws and regulations pursuant to which our OPOs provide donor hearts will not change making it more difficult or even impossible for the OPOs to continue to supply us with the hearts we need to produce our product.\nWe have no prior experience in manufacturing product for large clinical trials or commercial use.\nOur manufacturing experience has been limited to manufacturing CAP-1002 for the current ALLSTAR trial. We have no prior history or experience in manufacturing our allogeneic product or any other product for any clinical use and no experience manufacturing any product for large clinical trials or commercial use. Our product candidates have not previously been tested in any large trials to show safety or efficacy, nor are they available for commercial use. We face risks of manufacturing failures and risks of making products that are not proven to be safe or effective.\nAs we continue with the development of Cenderitide or CU-NP, we will rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture these product candidates and provide us with the devices and other products necessary to administer Cenderitide or CU-NP.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities for the production of Cenderitide or CU-NP. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. As we continue with our clinical trial of Cenderitide or the possible development of CU-NP, we will have to contract with one or more manufacturers to manufacture, supply, store, and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. If either of these product candidates receives FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture supplies of our drug candidates. In addition, these product candidates may require the use of one or more medical devices for infusion into patients. We have contracted with Insulet Corporation to supply us with its OmniPod\u00ae pumps to utilize with Cenderitide for our current trial. We will have to enter into additional contracts with one or more device manufacturers to manufacture and supply the devices to be used in the dosing procedures for any future trials of Cenderitide or CU-NP. Our current and anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u00b7 We may be unable to identify manufacturers needed to manufacture our product candidates or the necessary devices on acceptable terms or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited, and subsequent to approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer may have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products or the devices after receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u00b7 Some of the raw materials needed to manufacture our product candidates are available from a very limited number of suppliers. Although we believe we have good relationships with these suppliers, we may have difficulty identifying alternative suppliers if our arrangements with our current suppliers are disrupted or terminated.\n\u00b7 Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any.\n\u00b7 Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to manufacture or supply us with sufficient quantities of devices or acceptable materials necessary for the development or use of our product candidates.\n\u00b7 Our product candidates may not perform well, or if at all, with the devices received from third-party manufacturers.\n\u00b7 Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our products or the materials or devices needed to manufacture or utilize our product candidates.\n\u00b7 Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA, or the commercialization of our product candidates, or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may face uncertainty and difficulty in obtaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights.\nOur success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain, and defend patents on our products, obtain licenses to use third party technologies, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Legal standards regarding the scope of claims and validity of biotechnology patents are uncertain and evolving. There can be no assurance that our pending, licensed-in or owned patent applications will be approved, or that challenges will not be instituted against the validity or enforceability of any patent licensed-in or owned by us. Additionally, we have entered into various confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. There is no assurance that such agreements will be honored by such parties or enforced in whole or part by the courts. The cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent is substantial. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent technologies not covered by patents to which we own rights or obtain access to our know-how. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Our competitors may possess or obtain patents on products or processes that are necessary or useful to the development, use, or manufacture of our products. There can also be no assurance that our proposed technology will not infringe patents or proprietary rights owned by others, with the result that others may bring infringement claims against us and require us to license such proprietary rights, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any such litigation, if instituted, could have a material adverse effect, potentially including monetary penalties, diversion of management resources, and injunction against continued manufacture, use, or sale of certain products or processes.\nSome of our technology has resulted, and will result, from research funded by agencies of the United States government and the State of California. As a result of such funding, the United States government and the State of California have certain rights in the technology developed with the funding. These rights include a non-exclusive, paid-up, worldwide license under such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, under certain conditions, the government has the right to require us to grant third parties licenses to such technology. The licenses by which we have obtained some of our intellectual property are subject to the rights of the funding agencies. We also rely upon non-patented proprietary know-how. There can be no assurance that we can adequately protect our rights in such non-patented proprietary know-how, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or gain access to our proprietary know-how. Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, if any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information were to be disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nIn September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the U.S. transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-parties review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of our licensors. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents and those licensed to us.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. If we fail to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish.\nOur commercial viability will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates, and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nWe have licensed certain patent and other intellectual property rights that cover our CAP-1002, CAP-1001, and CSps product candidates from University of Rome, JHU and CSMC. We have also licensed certain patent and other intellectual property rights that cover exosomes from CSMC. Under the license agreements with University of Rome and JHU, those institutions prosecute and maintain their patents and patent applications in collaboration with us. We rely on these institutions to file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications, and otherwise protect the intellectual property to which we have a license, and we have not had and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of these patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that such activities by these institutions have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. Under the Amended CSMC License Agreement and the Exosomes License Agreement, we have assumed, in coordination with CSMC, responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of all patents and patent applications. Our enforcement of certain of these licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents would also be subject to the cooperation of the third parties.\nWe also license certain patent and other intellectual property rights that cover our Cenderitide and CU-NP product candidates from Mayo. In the past, we have relied on Mayo to file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications, and otherwise protect the intellectual property to which we have a license, and, prior to the Amended Mayo License Agreement, we did not have primary control over these activities for certain of these patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the activities conducted by Mayo have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. With the execution of the Amended Mayo License Agreement, we are responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of the Mayo patents and patent applications covered by our license, and the associated costs and expenses. Our enforcement of certain of these licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents would be subject to the cooperation of the third parties.\nIn October 2014, we entered into a Transfer Agreement with Medtronic, Inc. or Medtronic, pursuant to which we received an assignment of patent rights that were owned or co-owned by Medtronic relating to natriuretic peptides. We have responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of such patents and patent applications at our expense. We cannot be certain that the activities conducted by Medtronic prior to our acquisition of these patents and patent rights were conducted in compliance with applicable law and regulations, or will result in valid and enforceable patents. Our enforcement of certain of these assigned patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents would be subject to the cooperation of third parties.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biopharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States. The biopharmaceutical patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents we own or to which we have a license or third-party patents. Further, if any of our patents are deemed invalid and unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7 others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of any of our patents;\n\u00b7 we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by any issued patents or patent applications we may have (or third parties from whom we license intellectual property may have);\n\u00b7 we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 it is possible that any pending patent applications we may have will not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties;\n\u00b7 we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u00b7 the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators, and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how.\nIf any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur viability also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors to enter into agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has recently invalidated some tests used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting patents over the past 20 years. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our own or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation in a re-examination proceeding before the USPTO or during litigation under the revised criteria which make it more difficult to obtain patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. We have agreed to indemnify certain of our commercial partners against certain patent infringement claims brought by third parties. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe are largely dependent on our relationships with our licensors and collaborators and there is no guarantee that such relationships will be maintained or continued.\nWe have entered into certain license agreements for certain intellectual property rights which are essential to enable us to develop and commercialize our products. Agreements have been entered into with the University of Rome, JHU and CSMC, which is also a shareholder of ours. Each of those agreements provides for an exclusive license to certain patents and other intellectual property and requires the payment of fees, milestone payments and/or royalties to the institutions that will reduce our net revenues, if and to the extent that we have future revenues. Each of those agreements also contains additional obligations that we are required to satisfy. There is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy all of our obligations under our license agreements to each of the institutions and that such license agreements will not be terminated. Each of the institutions receives funding from independent sources such as the NIH and other private not-for-profit sources and are investigating scientific and clinical questions of interest to their own principal investigators as well as the scientific and clinical communities at large. These investigators (including Capricor\u2019s founder, Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, who is the Director of the Heart Institute at CSMC) are under no obligation to conduct, continue, or conclude either current or future studies utilizing our stem cell or exosomes technology, and they are not compelled to license any further technologies or intellectual property rights to us except as may be stated in the applicable licensing agreements between those institutions and us. Changes in these collaborators\u2019 research interests or their funding sources away from our technology would have a material adverse effect on us. We are substantially dependent on our relationships with these institutions from which we license the rights to our technologies and know-how. If requirements under our license agreements are not met, we could suffer significant harm, including losing rights to our product candidates.\nOur rights to our Cenderitide and CU-NP drug candidates were both derived from separate license agreements between us and Mayo. On November 14, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement, which we refer to as the Amended Mayo Agreement, with Mayo pursuant to which the rights to both Cenderitide and CU-NP were included in the Amended Mayo Agreement and many of the terms of the former agreements were revised on terms more favorable to us. We are substantially dependent on our relationship with Mayo with respect to the rights to these two drug candidates. If requirements under our license agreement are not met, we could suffer significant harm. In order to develop these products, we will need to maintain the intellectual property rights to these product candidates. The Amended Mayo Agreement requires us to perform certain obligations that affect our rights under the Amended Mayo Agreement, including making cash payments if we were to enter into certain types of business transactions. If we fail to comply with our obligations required under the Amended Mayo Agreement, we could lose important patent and other intellectual property rights which may be critical to our business.\nIn addition, we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us. If we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner, we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology.\nFinally, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our product candidates and technologies. Licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe have received government grants and a loan award which impose certain conditions on our operations.\nCommencing in 2009, we received several grants from the NIH to fund various projects, including Phase I of the ALLSTAR trial. In 2014, we received a grant from the NIH to fund the planned DYNAMIC trial. These awards are subject to annual and quarterly reporting requirements. If we fail to meet these requirements, the NIH could cease further funding.\nOn February 5, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement with CIRM, pursuant to which CIRM has agreed to disburse $19,782,136 to us over a period of approximately three and one-half years to support Phase II of our ALLSTAR clinical trial. Under the Loan Agreement, we are required to repay the CIRM loan with interest at maturity. The loan also provides for the payment of a risk premium whereby we are required to pay CIRM a premium up to 500% of the loan amount upon the achievement of certain revenue thresholds. The loan has a term of five years and is extendable annually up to ten years from the original issuance at our option if certain conditions are met. CIRM has the right to cease disbursements if a no-go milestone occurs or certain other conditions are not satisfied. The timing of the distribution of funds pursuant to the Loan Agreement is contingent upon the availability of funds in the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Fund in the State Treasury, as determined by CIRM in its sole discretion. So long as we are not in default, the loan may be forgiven during the term of the project period if we abandon the trial due to the occurrence of a no-go milestone. After the end of the project period, the loan may be forgiven if we elect to abandon the project under certain circumstances. Under the Loan Agreement, we are also required to meet certain financial milestones by demonstrating to CIRM prior to each disbursement of loan proceeds that we have funds available sufficient to fund all costs and expenses anticipated to be required to continue Phase II of the ALLSTAR trial for at least the following 12-month period, less the costs budgeted to be covered by planned loan disbursements. We are also required to meet certain progress milestones specified in the Notice of Loan Award. There is no assurance that we will meet our milestones under the Loan Agreement or that CIRM will not discontinue the disbursement of funds.\nIf we enter into strategic partnerships, we may be required to relinquish important rights to and control over the development of our product candidates or otherwise be subject to terms unfavorable to us.\nIf we do not establish strategic partnerships, we will have to undertake development and commercialization efforts on our own, which would be costly and adversely impact our ability to commercialize any future products or product candidates. If we enter into any strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or other life science companies, we will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our strategic partners devote to the development or commercialization of product candidates;\n\u00b7 strategic partners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7 strategic partners may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic partnering arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs;\n\u00b7 strategic partners may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of any future products, limiting our potential revenues from these products;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise between us and our strategic partners that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and consumes resources;\n\u00b7 strategic partners may experience financial difficulties;\n\u00b7 strategic partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7 business combinations or significant changes in a strategic partner\u2019s business strategy may also adversely affect a strategic partner\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement; and\n\u00b7 strategic partners could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors.\nThere is a risk that Janssen may not exercise its option for an exclusive license.\nThe Company has entered into a Collaboration Agreement and Exclusive License Option with Janssen Biotech, Inc. There is no guarantee that Janssen will exercise its option for an exclusive license and enter into an agreement with the Company. If Janssen declines to exercise the option it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company.\nRisks Related to Competitive Factors\nOur products will likely face intense competition.\nThe Company is engaged in fields that are characterized by extensive worldwide research and competition by pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, specialized biotechnology companies, hospitals, physicians and academic institutions, both in the United States and abroad. We will experience intense competition with respect to our existing and future product candidates. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, greater clinical trial experience, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing capabilities than we do. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies, and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same indications as our product candidates. We expect any future products and product candidates that we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, extent of adverse side effects, and convenience of treatment procedures. One or more of our competitors may develop products based upon the principles underlying our proprietary technologies earlier than we do, obtain approvals for such products from the FDA more rapidly than we do, or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than any product developed by us. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, useful, and less costly than ours and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to evolving therapies as well as other novel technologies. There can be no assurance that existing or future therapies developed by others will not render our potential products obsolete or noncompetitive. The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures, or other collaborations.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and advisors, or if any of our key executives, key employees or key consultants discontinues his or her employment or consulting relationship with us, it may delay our development efforts or otherwise harm our business. In addition, several of our employees and consultants render services on a part-time basis to us or to other companies.\nAll former employees of Nile were terminated upon consummation of the merger between Nile and Capricor. We do not currently have any employees who have experience in the development of natriuretic peptides. The loss of any of our key employees or key consultants could impede the achievement of our research and development objectives. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future is critical to the Company\u2019s success. The Company may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, and health care companies, universities, and non-profit research institutions for experienced scientists. Certain of the Company\u2019s officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants or certain of the officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants hereafter appointed may from time to time serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. The Company may not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on any of its officers or employees. All of the Company\u2019s employees will be employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, each employee may leave the employment of the Company at any time. If we are unable to retain our existing employees, including qualified scientific personnel, and attract additional qualified candidates, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our technology, we are dependent upon existing key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and scientific personnel for research, clinical studies, and development activities conducted or sponsored by us. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in our fields of research and development, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract additional qualified personnel necessary for the development and commercialization of our product candidates or retain our current personnel. Dr. Linda Marb\u00e1n, our Chief Executive Officer and employee, also provides services on a part-time basis to CSMC as do several other of our employees and Dr. Frank Litvack is only a part-time consultant to the Company and provides services to other non-competing enterprises. These individuals\u2019 multiple responsibilities on behalf of the Company and other entities could cause the Company harm in that such employees are unable to devote their full-time and attention to the Company.\nIf we do not establish strategic partnerships, we will have to undertake development and commercialization efforts on our own, which would be costly and delay our ability to commercialize any future products or product candidates.\nAn element of our business strategy includes potentially partnering with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies to obtain assistance for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, including the cash and other resources we need for such development and potentially commercialization. We may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to negotiate strategic partnerships for our product candidates we may be forced to curtail the development of a particular candidate, reduce or delay its development program, delay its potential commercialization, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. In addition, we will bear all the risk related to the development of that product candidate. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain substantial additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing, or distributing products and no internal capability to do so.\nThe Company currently has no sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our proposed products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain sales and marketing collaborative relationships, or on our ability to build sales and marketing capabilities internally. If we enter into a sales and marketing collaborative relationship, then we will be dependent upon the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products under development, and such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources, and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nIf any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from their sales will be limited.\nThe commercial viability of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance among physicians, the medical community, and patients, and coverage and reimbursement of them by third-party payors, including government payors. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling;\n\u00b7 changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n\u00b7 limitations inherent in the approved indication for any of our product candidates compared to more commonly understood or addressed conditions;\n\u00b7 lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u00b7 prevalence and severity of adverse effects;\n\u00b7 ineffective marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u00b7 lack of availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors;\n\u00b7 lack of cost-effectiveness;\n\u00b7 timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products;\n\u00b7 availability of alternative therapies at similar costs; and\n\u00b7 potential product liability claims.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell our product candidates in the marketplace will also depend on pricing and cost effectiveness, including our ability to manufacture a product at a competitive price. We will also need to demonstrate acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy and may need to demonstrate relative convenience and ease of administration. Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenue, if any.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our drugs sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur ability to generate significant sales of our products depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Healthcare providers that purchase medicine or medical products for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the products. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Patients are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of our products.\nIn addition, the market for our future products will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Industry competition to be included in such formularies results in downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies when a generic equivalent is available.\nAll third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the United States or outside, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payors. Therefore, coverage of and reimbursement for medical products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, limiting our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payors increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. Even if our product candidates are approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover our drugs. If government and other healthcare payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for any of our products, once approved, market acceptance of our products could be reduced.\nRisks Related to Product and Environmental Liability\nOur products may expose us to potential product liability, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain and maintain adequate insurance to cover these liabilities.\nThe testing, marketing, and sale of human cell therapeutics, pharmaceuticals, and services entail an inherent risk of adverse effects or medical complications to patients and, as a result, product liability claims may be asserted against us. A future product liability claim or product recall could have a material adverse effect on the Company. There can be no assurance that product liability insurance will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms, if at all, or that coverage will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims. In the event of a successful claim against the Company, insufficient or lack of insurance or indemnification rights could result in liability to us, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its future viability. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval, if at all, expose the Company to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against the Company by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7 loss of revenues; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe Company has obtained clinical trial insurance coverage for its clinical trials. However, such insurance coverage may not reimburse the Company or may not be sufficient to reimburse it for any expenses or losses it may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect the Company against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company could have a material adverse effect on us and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash position and adversely affect our business.\nOur business involves risk associated with handling hazardous and other dangerous materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, human blood and tissue, animal blood and blood products, animal tissue, biological waste, and various radioactive compounds. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. The failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines against the Company, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes, or cessation of operations.\nOur business depends on compliance with ever-changing environmental laws.\nWe cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that may be required to comply with comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We must comply with environmental laws that govern, among other things, all emissions, waste water discharge and solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with generation, handling and disposal activities. To date, the Company has not incurred significant costs and is not aware of any significant liabilities associated with its compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, environmental laws have changed in recent years and the Company may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and may face large capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws. We have limited capital and we are uncertain whether we will be able to pay for significantly large capital expenditures that may be required to comply with new laws. Also, future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your investment price.\nThe stock market, particularly in recent years, has experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons, and as a result our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 our financial condition, including our need for additional capital;\n\u00b7 results from, delays in, or discontinuation of, any of the clinical trials for our drug candidates, including delays resulting from slower than expected or suspended patient enrollment or discontinuations resulting from a failure to meet pre-defined clinical endpoints;\n\u00b7 announcements concerning clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure or delays in entering drug candidates into clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\u00b7 developments in establishing new strategic alliances or with existing alliances;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other healthcare related sectors;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 issues in manufacturing our drug candidates or drugs;\n\u00b7 issues with the supply or manufacturing of any devices or materials needed to manufacture or utilize our drug candidates;\n\u00b7 FDA or other United States or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our drugs, when they enter the market;\n\u00b7 third-party healthcare coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 litigation or public concern about the safety of our drug candidates or drugs;\n\u00b7 issuance of new or revised securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel; or\n\u00b7 volatility in the stock prices of other companies in our industry.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert our management\u2019s time and attention.\nWe have never paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the future.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that the Company will retain its earnings, if any, for future growth. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in the Company\u2019s common stock for that purpose.\nThere may be additional issuances of shares of blank check preferred stock in the future.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are issued or currently outstanding. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred shares, as well as the authority to issue such shares, without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that is senior to our common stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividends, additional registration rights, anti-dilution protection, the right to the redemption of such shares, together with other rights, none of which will be afforded holders of our common stock.\nMarket and economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and ability to obtain financing.\nRecent global market and economic conditions have been unpredictable and challenging. These conditions and any adverse impact on the financial markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to access the capital markets to meet our liquidity needs.\nWe may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.\nSecurity analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our Company in the future. The lack of such analyst coverage may decrease the public demand for our common stock, making it more difficult for you to resell your shares when you deem appropriate.\nThe operational and other projections and forecasts that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections and forecasts that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to timing, progress and anticipated results of clinical development, regulatory processes, clinical trial timelines and any anticipated benefits of our product candidates) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in (or incorporated by reference in) this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. Additionally, final data may differ significantly from preliminary data reported.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management team that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of preserving our current management, such as:\n\u00b7 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u00b7 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for our stockholders to affect our corporate policies, make changes in our Board of Directors and for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.\nOwnership of the Company\u2019s common stock is highly concentrated, which may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decline.\nThe former stockholders of Capricor, Inc., now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, many of whom are executive officers and directors of the Company, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own or control a substantial majority of the outstanding shares of the Company. Accordingly, the stockholders, acting individually or as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action of the Company requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would benefit the other stockholders of the Company. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to utilize Nile\u2019s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future is subject to substantial limitations and may be further limited as a result of the merger with Capricor.\nFederal and state income tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss, or NOL, and tax credit carryforwards in the event that an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs for tax purposes, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an ownership change occurs when shareholders owning 5% or more of a \u201closs corporation\u201d (a corporation entitled to use NOL or other loss carryforwards) have increased their aggregate ownership of stock in such corporation by more than 50 percentage points during any three-year period. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownership change NOLs of the loss corporation experiencing the ownership change. The annual limitation is calculated by multiplying the loss corporation\u2019s value immediately before the ownership change by the greater of the long-term tax-exempt rate determined by the IRS in the month of the ownership change or the two preceding months. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. Section 383 of the Code also imposes a limitation on the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by the loss corporation\u2019s pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards.\nIt is expected that the merger between Nile and Capricor resulted in an \u201cownership change\u201d of Nile. In addition, previous or current changes in the Company\u2019s stock ownership may have triggered or, in the future, may trigger an \u201cownership change\u201d, some of which may be outside our control. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to utilize Nile\u2019s NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be substantially limited. These limitations could, in turn, result in increased future tax payments for the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and other applicable securities rules and regulations, and are subject to the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have hired employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and any market on which the Company\u2019s shares may be listed in the future, impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. The Company\u2019s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase the Company\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Our annual reports on Form 10-K must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. The requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot be certain that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur, these weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 92686, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CAPR"}
