RISK FACTORS\nThis Item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or materially impact our financial results and condition. Our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have a risk management governance structure that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure.\nThe following discussion highlights risks which could impact us in material ways by causing our future\nresults to differ materially from our past results, by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or by causing material changes in our financial condition. In this Item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time. However, other risks may prove to be important in the future, and new risks may emerge at any time. We cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could materially affect our financial performance or condition.\nTABLE OF ITEM 1A TOPICS\nTopic Page\nForward-Looking Statements\nCompetition Risks\nRisk From Economic Downturns and Changes\nRisks Associated with Monetary Events\nStrategic Risks\nRisks Related to Exited Businesses\nLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\nReputation Risks\nCredit Risks\nOperational Risks\nTopic Page\nService Risks\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks\nRisks of Expense Control\nGeographic Risks\nInsurance\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nCredit Ratings\nInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks\nSecurities Inventories and Market Risks\nAccounting Risks\nRisks of Holding our Stock\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report on Form 10-K and our 2014 Annual Report, including materials incorporated into either of them, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are not a recitation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cis likely,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cgoing forward,\u201d and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: global, general, and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; the pace, consistency, and extent of recovery of values and activity in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirements for us to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; potential claims relating to the foreclosure process; potential claims relating to participation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and\nmonetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means affecting us directly or affecting our customers or business counterparties; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; the increasing use of new technologies to interact with customers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible future regulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks\ninvolved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.\nWe assume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements that are made in our 2014 Annual Report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and\nexpectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in other Items of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report, including our 2014 Annual Report, should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects.\nCompetition Risks\nWe are subject to intense competition for customers, and the nature of that competition is changing quickly. Our primary areas of competition for customers include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve.\nSome competitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory framework as we, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. A recent example of unregulated activity is so-called \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d lending, where investors provide lending capital directly to borrowers.\nThrough technological innovations and changes in customer habits, the manner in which customers use financial services is changing. We provide a large number of services remotely (desktop online or mobile), and physical branch utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has allowed disruptors to\nenter some traditional banking areas. Some traditional consumer banking services now are largely provided through retailers, especially grocery stores and so-called super-stores which customers visit frequently. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible until recently.\nWe expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the \u201cCompetition\u201d heading of Item 1 beginning on page 14 of this report.\nWe compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets. See \u201cLiquidity and Funding Risks\u201d beginning on page 31 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.\nWe compete to hire, retain, and motivate our employees. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively.\nRisk from Economic Downturns and Changes\nGenerally in an economic downturn our credit losses increase, demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness),\ndeposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse\neconomic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin,\nand lower fees from transactions and services. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn officially ends.\nRisks Associated with Monetary Events\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve, and currently is transitioning from many years of easing to what may be a new period of tightening. In recent years, in response to the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve has implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives. Several of these have emphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. Other significant monetary strategies could be implemented in the future including, in particular, so-called tightening strategies. Federal reserve strategies can, and often are intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things, easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economic activity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply, and restrain economic activity. Other things being equal, the current transition from easing to possible tightening should tend to diminish or reverse downward pressure on rates, and to diminish or eventually end the stimulus effect that low rates tend to have on the economy. Many external factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed unexpectedly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events. An example of the former is the substantial drop in oil prices experienced in late 2014 and early 2015. Two examples of the latter are the rise in 2014 and 2015 (to date) in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to many\nother currencies, and decisions in the EU in late 2014 and 2015 (to date) to pursue or enhance easing strategies. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption \u201cInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks\u201d beginning on page 32. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly to economic and market conditions overseas, especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Central and South America. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or foreign sovereign debt, in the future major adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers; impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow our consumer and commercial banking businesses and our capital markets business. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. As part of this change in strategy, in 2008\nwe sold our national mortgage platforms, closed our national lending operations, and renewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditional southeastern U.S. markets in and around Tennessee. Since 2008 we have sold or closed units which did not perform or complement our strategy. The 2008 sale of the national\nmortgage platforms and closure of national lending have contributed to significant declines in the amount of mortgage loans we originate and hold compared to earlier years. Similarly, sales of mortgage servicing assets and obligations have nearly eliminated assets associated with the legacy servicing business. From the end of 2008 to the end of 2014, loans within our non-strategic portfolio declined approximately 72 percent to $2.5 billion.\nAlthough our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking businesses and in our capital markets business. Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past two years has been largely organic but also through two completed acquisitions. In recent years we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into contiguous southeast U.S. markets with similar characteristics, and expanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. At year-end another acquisition was pending in the Raleigh, North Carolina market. In the future, we may rely more on acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves, but expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth as well. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including:\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas;\n\u25cf our ability to achieve and maintain stability in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities which, in the current operating environment, may emphasize customers that are predisposed to change their demand for our products quickly;\n\u25cf in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers in the US and overseas;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;\n\u25cf our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-funded acquisitions; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by an increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory environment which continues to evolve rapidly.\nWe have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.\nTo the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various additional risks, including:\n\u25cf our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;\n\u25cf our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u25cf our ability to manage any operational or cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions;\n\u25cf our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and,\n\u25cf our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement the disposition of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We have made several exit moves since 2007 and could make others again as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:\n\u25cf our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;\n\u25cf our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;\n\u25cf our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss.\nRisks Related to Exited Businesses\nWe have significant risks from the businesses we have exited, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, and higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. In first quarter 2014 we completed our exit from substantially all of our legacy mortgage servicing business. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:\n\u25cf We have experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements when we sold mortgage loans. Losses at elevated levels may continue for some time to come. In 2008, we recognized expense related to obligations to repurchase loans of $29.5 million and that expense increased to $147.8 million in 2009 and $189.8 million in 2010 before declining to $159.6 million in 2011. In 2012 and 2013 we recognized significant expense as a result of substantial settlements with the two largest purchasers of our mortgages prior to 2009. Although our expenses related to these matters have declined substantially the past three years, further new information could be received in the future resulting in further adjustments related to exposures not covered by the settlements. Our total repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $299.3 million for 2012, $170.0 million for 2013, and negative $4.3 million for 2014.\n\u25cf We are defending several litigation matters associated with claims arising out of our former mortgage securitization activities. The outcome of\nthose matters is extremely uncertain and possible losses could be substantial.\n\u25cf Although no such demand has yet been made of us, the trustee for those securitizations could demand repurchase of loans placed into securitizations if we breached the contractual requirements made when the securitizations were created or if we are obligated to indemnify the trustee.\n\u25cf We have responded to investigations and inquiries by various parties, including government agencies, related to mortgage loans we originated. Inquiries have been wide ranging. A few have led to litigation. One pending investigation involves the FHA insurance program. Although no litigation or demand is pending the eventual outcome of this matter is unknown and could involve a substantial sum.\n\u25cf We could be subject to claims that foreclosures and other servicing-related actions taken by us, or on our behalf, were done improperly.\n\u25cf The consumer and commercial loans on our books from our former national specialty lending business have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis may have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults.\nAdditional information concerning these risks appears in \u201cLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\u201d beginning on page 21 of this Item 1A.Other trends adverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions if counterparties are stressed by economic conditions, both domestic and global, and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses.\nLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\nLike many other financial institutions that originated and sold significant amounts of mortgage loans, we have experienced elevated exposure to repurchase obligations from entities which purchased mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from us. Prior to August 2008, we originated loans through our legacy mortgage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. A substantial majority of such loans were\nsold to or guaranteed by government agencies (\u201cAgencies\u201d) or were sold to other purchasers. Two primary types of these sales occurred: so-called whole loan sales; and sales through First Horizon branded proprietary securitizations. Whole loan sales were primarily to two Agencies but also were to other purchasers; in those cases we contracted with the buyers directly. The securities issued in the proprietary securitizations were backed by the loans originated by\nour legacy mortgage business. Those securities were sold to many types of investors including the Agencies and federal home loan banks; in those cases we have contractual relationships with underwriters of the securities and with the trustees holding the loans, and we provided investors with information at the time of sale in the form of offering documents. In some cases the whole loans sold by us were in turn securitized by the purchaser. In some cases the loans or securities were insured, as mentioned below, and in those cases we contracted with the insurers. As described below, we retain risk of loss in connection with each of those past relationships, and that risk varies greatly with the type of relationship.\nAlthough we conducted a significant mortgage business dating back to the 1990s and we have had losses dating back at least to 2000, our loss from that business primarily relates to loans made in the middle 2000s. From 2005 through 2008, we originated and sold $69.5 billion original principal amount of first lien mortgage loans in whole-loan transactions involving the Agencies. Of that, $57.6 billion was sold to two government-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d): Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d). The remainder was guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d). Although additional GSE whole-loan sales occurred in earlier years, a significant majority of GSE repurchase requests (discussed below) have come from the 2005-8 period. In addition, from 2005 through 2007 we sold $26.7 billion original principal amount of first lien mortgage loans in First Horizon branded securitizations. Additional proprietary securitizations occurred in earlier periods, but the pending claims (discussed below) relate to those three years. We also securitized HELOC and second-lien loans in proprietary transactions (\u201cHELOC securitizations\u201d).\nStarting in 2009, whole-loan purchasers increased their efforts to seek to require loan sellers to repurchase those loans or to reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans when losses are incurred due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchase contract representations or warranties. A substantial majority of our whole loan sales were to GSEs. GSE representations and warranties claims typically include claims that loans had missing or insufficient file documentation or that loans were obtained through fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. As a result, we face pressure from whole-loan purchasers to repurchase those loans or to make the purchaser whole, and we face expenses to administer and resist such claims. In 2013 and 2014 we agreed to substantial settlements with both GSEs. Although they have substantially\nreduced repurchase requests from those purchasers and overall, not all loan categories are covered by the settlements, nor are other purchasers.\nFor loans sold in proprietary securitizations we have potential exposure for investment rescission or damages arising from legal claims that the offering documents under which the loans were securitized were materially deficient. As of December 31, 2014, we were a defendant in a total of three such lawsuits. Additionally, we have received various indemnity demands from underwriters for certain expenses and losses incurred in other suits but have not been named a defendant. Other lawsuits or requests for indemnification may be brought in the future. There is also potential repurchase exposure and rescission risk associated with our proprietary securitizations under the contracts with trustees through which the securitizations were created. Our securitization trustee could initiate a repurchase process on its own or at the behest of a sufficient percentage of securitization investors. However, the repurchase process is more difficult for securitization investors to initiate than it is for GSEs in whole loan sales. At December 31, 2014, no such repurchase requests had been received with respect to our proprietary first-lien mortgage securitizations. At December 31, 2014, based on applicable accounting guidance associated with contingencies, we had no reserve for potential losses associated with private first-lien mortgage securitizations except for one suit.\nA significant portion of the loans we sold to GSEs were required to have private mortgage insurance (\u201cMI\u201d). MI also was provided for some of the loans in proprietary securitizations. We have received MI cancellation notices from the insurers which wrote these policies based on claims of fraud or misrepresentations relating to the insured loans. To date a majority of MI cancellations have involved loans sold to GSEs. Although unresolved MI cancellation notices are not formal repurchase requests, we include these in the active repurchase request pipeline when analyzing and estimating loss content in relation to the loans sold or securitized. In the settlements mentioned above we retain exposure for MI cancellations.\nThe pipeline of repurchase requests, including related unresolved MI cancellation notices as of December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $174.9 million, $197.2 million, $333.8 million, $383.5 million, and $534.2 million, respectively. The GSE settlements mentioned above covered many but not all obligations we have with the GSEs. Covered matters were removed from the pipeline at the time of each settlement, substantially impacting its balance.\nOur liability for repurchase losses is assessed quarterly. Although not all loans repurchased are in arrears or default, as a practical matter most have been. As a result, loss recognition for repurchased loans as a group has been much higher than for consumer loans typically held in our portfolio. Also, although we re-evaluate our reserves for repurchase losses each quarter, evaluations of that sort necessarily are estimates, volatility has been high, and there remains a risk that the reserves will not be adequate. Future volatility should be less than in the past, though risk remains with respect to loans not covered by the settlements and loans not sold to GSEs. The liability (our reserve) for repurchase and foreclosure losses was $119.4 million, $165.1 million, $232.4 million, $165.3 million, and $182.9 million on December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.\nWhile the vast majority of claims made to date relate to whole-loan sales to GSEs, in the aggregate significant claims have been made with respect to other purchasers and investors. Also, while the volume in the repurchase pipeline has been falling, the proportion of non-GSE claims has grown. The number of repurchase requests, MI cancellation notices, or lawsuits may be volatile over time. An increase in the volume of such claims beyond what we are currently experiencing, an increase in the loss rate we experience upon resolution of these claims, or an increase in the time it takes a purchaser to make or resolve a claim, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions \u201cRepurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations\u201d beginning on page 51, \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 57, and \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 62 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the captions \u201cRPL-Excluded First Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization Litigation Matters,\u201d \u201cFirst Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization Litigation Matters,\u201d and \u201cLegacy Home Loan Sales and Servicing\u201d in Note 18 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginning on pages 132, 133, and 134, respectively, which is part of the material from our 2014 Annual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nAlthough we sold our mortgage servicing business and many of our servicing assets in 2008, we have significant exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which we retained after 2008, especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantially all our remaining servicing assets which we completed in first quarter 2014. State and federal officials and regulators have announced and commenced inquiries and investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks in completing affidavits relating to foreclosures and into the authority of the servicer to foreclose if assignments of legal interests in the mortgage loans have not been properly recorded. The attorneys general of all 50 states concluded a joint investigation of foreclosure practices across the industry and proposed significant changes in servicing practices related to foreclosures and substantial penalties. In 2012 the Justice Department announced that the federal government and attorneys general of 49 states had reached a $25 billion settlement agreement with five of the largest servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses. We were not a party to this settlement but the terms of it may affect later actions involving us. Government authorities have announced substantial mortgage-related settlements with major U.S. and foreign banks. The CFPB recently has adopted significant changes to servicing rules which are likely to increase the cost and compliance risks of servicing mortgage loans. Additional state or federal inquiries or investigations may be commenced. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries, actions, or regulatory changes or the impact that they could have on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\nWhen we sold our origination and servicing businesses in 2008 we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. At that time we engaged as our subservicer the purchaser of our business. In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a new subservicer. Our 2008 subservicer experienced significant losses in connection with its servicing business based in part on the circumstances outlined above and in connection with a Consent Decree relating to the same with the OCC. In 2012 the 2008 subservicer entered into a settlement agreement with the OCC along with 13 other large mortgage servicers that replaced the Consent Decree and its foreclosure look-back process and requires remediation for all borrowers with \u201cin process\u201d foreclosures from 2009 - 2010. Our 2008 subservicer has informed us that it expects us to reimburse it for a significant portion of its losses and costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagree with our 2008 subservicer\u2019s position and have made no\nreimbursements. We also believe that certain amounts billed us by agencies for penalties and curtailments of claims by the subservicer prior to the subservicing transfer but billed after that date are owed by the subservicer. This disagreement has the potential to result in litigation and, in any such future litigation, the claim against us may be substantial.\nAdditional information concerning risks related to servicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 57, \u201cForeclosure Practices\u201d beginning on page 61, and \u201cRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability\u201d beginning on page 62 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption \u201cServicing and Foreclosure Practices\u201d in Note 18 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 138 of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nIn 2014 several large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities filed suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting new theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizations is one of the defendants in such a suit, and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by the plaintiffs. The claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against the originators of the securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assert that the trustee had affirmative duties to act which were not set forth in the legal trust documents. Some of the legal theories advanced are untested or unsettled. Although we are not a defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolve so as to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee, and could create financial exposure for us.\nWe have elevated loss exposures associated with past lending under various government programs. Like most banks we have participated for many years in government-sponsored lending programs. At the federal level, during the period before we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing businesses, two prominent programs for us were the FHA and VA mortgage lending programs. Those programs require lenders like us to comply with various requirements in originating the loans. Non-compliance can lead to an agency demand that the lender reimburse resulting losses.\nAn agency also could demand enhanced damages, including treble damages, under various federal laws. A number of federal laws, including the False Claims Act, provide for substantial recoveries and penalties if false information is provided to a federal agency, and also provide that private citizens may sue in the name of the agency and obtain a portion of any recovery as a bounty. Some of these laws provide legal avenues for a wide variety of governmental agency claims, while others can have a narrower focus but include non-governmental claims. In some cases the laws provide for bounties if the government agency obtains a recovery. It is possible that suits under the False Claims Act or another law may be brought regarding our past financial business activities, such as mortgage originations, sales, securitizations, or servicing, either by a federal agency, by another party to those activities, or by an unrelated private person interested in pursuing the bounty. In 2012 we settled a private action of that sort related to a portion of our past VA lending. Currently a government agency investigation of our FHA lending since January 1, 2006 is ongoing.\nAdditional information concerning these government program risks, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth under the captions \u201cInquiry regarding FHA-Insured Loans\u201d and \u201cLegacy Home Loan Sales and Servicing\u201d in Note 18 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginning on pages 132 and 134, respectively, of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nIncreasingly, governmental entities have become key participants in proceedings, investigations, and settlements involving banking institutions that engaged in substantial mortgage activities before the financial crisis in 2008. Governmental entities are plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs in certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved related to our former mortgage businesses as mentioned above. We may face future actions or claims by governmental entities in areas mentioned above as well as in areas we are not able to predict. Significant settlements with governmental entities have been publicly announced by several large national and regional financial institutions. The trend of very large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. Additional information concerning pending or currently known proceedings and investigations, all of which is incorporated into this Item by this reference, is set forth under the captions \u201cInquiry regarding FHA-Insured\nLoans,\u201d \u201cFirst Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization Litigation Matters,\u201d \u201cContract Claim Settlement Process - Mortgage Repurchase Pipeline,\u201d and \u201cLegacy Home Loan Sales and Servicing,\u201d all in\nNote 18 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginning on page 131 of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that Report that was incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nReputation Risks\nOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.\nDamage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.\nCredit Risks\nWe face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary over time. Since 2007 our credit charge-offs, especially related to lending, increased to historically high levels. Net charge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $78.2 million in 2013 and $48.4 million in 2014. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan loss was $232.4 million as of December 31, 2014, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively.\nOur ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate among other things. We further manage lending credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of\nwhich are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty.\nWe record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption \u201cAccounting Risks\u201d beginning on page 34, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to increase, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other banking regulators.\nA significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years we have changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, and we will continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have had significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and\napproaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise adversely affected with substantial adverse consequences to us.\nA significant subset of our home equity lines of credit were originated prior to our national platform sale in 2008. An increasing number of those loans will switch in the next few years from interest-only payments to full amortization payments (principal and interest combined). In reserving for potential loss in this portfolio we model an increased rate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirements when that switch occurs. Our modeling is based, among other things, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains that actual default rates could exceed our modeling.\nThe composition of our loan portfolio inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2014, approximately 56% of total loans consisted of the commercial, financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 31% consisted of the consumer real estate category.\nThe largest component of the C&I category at year end was loans to finance and insurance companies, a component which represented about 22% of the C&I category at December 31, 2014. The second largest component was loans to mortgage companies. As a result, approximately 35% of the C&I category was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial services industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio.\nThe consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the category.\n\u25cf Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of home equity lines of credit, and much of the remainder consists of consumer installment loans.\n\u25cf Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 44% of the category consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.\n\u25cf Geographic concentration. At year end about 59% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 9% related to California, and no other state represented more than 3% of the category.\n\u25cf Legacy concentration. The consumer category is comprised in significant part of loans originated before 2009 by our legacy national mortgage lending business. Those loans consist of loans we originated and did not sell and loans we have repurchased in the course of resolving repurchase claims with loan buyers. Our portfolio of legacy loans has been shrinking in recent years due to loan sales and normal run-off; however, it remains a substantial portion of our overall portfolio.\nThe consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significant life events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, in the current environment regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types.\nOur new Houston office, opened in 2014, specializes in commercial lending and private banking. The commercial lending significantly focuses on three categories: energy, commercial real estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, & industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected, at least in part, to the energy industry, especially oil and gas production and distribution. Although at year-end the amount of total loans outstanding in the Houston office were financially insignificant in relation to our total loan portfolio, our Houston office is new and growing. In addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. In late 2014 and early 2015 oil prices fell substantially, putting financial pressure on businesses in that industry, especially highly leveraged businesses. Although there was no financial impact from that price decline on our overall loan business at year-end, continued volatility in oil prices might impact the future performance and growth of our Houston-based lending business.\nAdditional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions \u201cAsset Quality-Trend Analysis of 2014 Compared to 2013\u201d beginning on page 26, \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d beginning on page 45, and \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d beginning on page 62 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from\nthat report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nThe recent prolonged low-interest rate environment has created a challenge for us and other banks to balance\ntaking on higher risk against the need for income or yield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in our lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding our investments which, as they mature, are reinvested at current rates.\nOperational Risks\nOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost.\nA serious electronic security (cybersecurity) breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft of funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associated with the breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other\nelectronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and the regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.\nThe operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in 2013 and 2014 major U.S. retailers experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial data of millions of customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can cause us to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers, and our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Other possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nFailure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by\nthis reference, appears under the caption \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d beginning on page 45 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nThe delivery of financial services to customers and others increasingly depends upon technologies,\nsystems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement.\nService Risks\nWe provide a wide range of services to customers, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we provided them in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Our services include lending, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additional information\nconcerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d and \u201cCompliance Risk Management,\u201d each beginning on page 45 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks\nThe regulatory environment is challenging, and the regulatory impacts on us have become more restrictive and more costly. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment has been changing rapidly in recent years, and our regulatory burdens generally have been increasing, as a result of recent events affecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. Heightened levels of regulatory change are likely to continue for at least the next several years.\nWe are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 5, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the\nareas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs.\nThe following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory and legal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change.\nWe and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios. Those requirements are increasing. In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capital standards based on international standards known as \u201cBasel III.\u201d The revised standards create a new emphasis on Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, restrict eligibility criteria for\nregulatory capital instruments, and make more stringent the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets. The revised standards began to apply to us January 1, 2015. The old (2014) and new (2015) standards are discussed in Item 1 of this report above, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption \u201cCapital Adequacy\u201d starting on page 7.\nIf we were to incur financial losses persistently, or if the new regulatory requirements are interpreted or otherwise applied in an unexpectedly adverse manner, then at some point the ability of us or the Bank to meet applicable requirements could be adversely affected.\nPressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a persistently weak economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Such actions that have occurred in recent years include the elimination in 2008 of our twenty cents per share quarterly common cash dividend (which was reinstated at one cent per share in 2011, increased to five cents in 2013, and increased to six cents in 2015), two sales of our common stock and the issuance of a common stock warrant, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values were depressed. Other such actions could include the issuance of participating preferred stock, securities convertible into common or participating stock, or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock.\nAdditional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions \u201cCapital Adequacy\u201d and \u201cPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\u201d in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 7 and 9, respectively; under the captions \u201cCapital,\u201d \u201cCapital Management and Adequacy,\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d beginning on pages 23, 45, and 60, respectively, of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption \u201cRegulatory Capital\u201d in Note 13 - Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 122 of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.\nWe are required to conduct and submit to our regulators annual stress tests, the outcomes of which could further increase our capital requirements and, starting in 2015, could damage our ability to obtain credit and our reputation. In 2014 regulators implemented new stress\ntesting for institutions like ours and other risk management initiatives. Stress testing processes require banks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safety of certain assumed environmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatory stress testing, or another new significant risk management standard, could result in the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us to raise capital, which could adversely affect operating results or be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, starting with the 2015 test a summary of a portion of the results will be made public. A poor result, once published, could impact our ability to borrow funds and our reputation generally.\nStress testing and other new regulatory initiatives may have unintended perverse impacts upon us or the industry. For example, stress testing includes \u201crate shocks\u201d which model the financial impact of sudden large increases in market interest rates upon us. The magnitude of the assumed shocks has increased substantially under the new initiative. In practical effect this encourages banks to shorten the \u201cduration\u201d of their assets (loans and investments), discouraging long-term assets. Shortening duration should improve a bank\u2019s ability to withstand a very large rate shock. However, it also can reduce the effective yield a bank receives from its assets, which would put downward pressure on revenues, margins, and earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act made significant changes to how financial services companies are regulated.\nMany of the changes in the Dodd-Frank Reform Act are not yet complete. Other than those mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, areas covered by the Reform Act which presently appear likely to present the greatest risks to us are mentioned below:\n\u25cf Final regulations under the Reform Act\u2019s so-called Durbin Amendment were issued in 2011. Effective October 1 that year, they severely capped the interchange fees which banks are able to charge merchants for debit card transactions to 21 cents per transaction with an additional 5 basis points available to cover fraud losses. The cap represents a substantial reduction compared to the rates that prevailed in the market previously. It is estimated that our annual revenue from interchange fees was reduced by approximately $20 million. In 2013 a court ruled that the reductions imposed in the regulations were too lenient. That ruling was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court has declined to review the case. Risk remains, however, that these new rules could be altered or\ninterpreted in ways adverse to the industry to the significant detriment of the Bank.\n\u25cf The Reform Act\u2019s municipal advisor requirements could adversely affect our capital markets, derivatives, and other activities with municipal customers.\n\u25cf The Reform Act has excluded certain items, including trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital of financial institutions having assets of $15 billion or more. A direct effect of this exclusion will be to remove $200 million of currently outstanding securities from our Tier 1 capital partly after 2014 and entirely after 2015.\nRisks of Expense Control\nOur ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. The importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow growth, low net interest margin business environment. Overall, our noninterest expenses have been improving: in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 noninterest expense was $1,341.8 million, $1,293.0 million, $1,383.7 million, $1,158.6 million, and $841.2 million, respectively. Volatility in noninterest expense has been significantly affected by increasingly idiosyncratic charges related to legacy mortgage activities as discussed in this Item 1A under the caption \u201cLegacy Mortgage Business Risks\u201d beginning on page 21.\nWe manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recent years we have\nexited non-strategic businesses and have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usually entail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs, and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future.\nWe have also re-focused our attention on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects rather than merely revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returns on capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment of our resources. Economic profit analysis involves a significant amount of judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run.\nGeographic Risks\nWe are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions. To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S., and Tennessee in particular, were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint.\nWe have international assets in the form of loans and letters of credit. Holding non-U.S assets creates a number of risks: the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or\nincreased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed.\nInsurance\nOur property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we are or may become subject to, and we may be adversely affected by a default by the insurers that provide us mortgage and bank-owned life insurance.\nWe use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.\nA portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which\ncould result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. In recent years events of this sort have happened. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified.\nWe own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on our books. Some of those policies are \u201cgeneral account\u201d and others are \u201cseparate account.\u201d The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nLiquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2013 and 2014 were met principally by deposits, by financing from other financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets.\nDeposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If the economy improves or market rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly, as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interest margin to the extent that loan rates do not rise correspondingly and at the same time.\nThe market among banks for deposits may be impacted in 2015 and later years as a result of the new Basel III capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Moreover, institutions with more than $50 billion of assets are required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. Larger banks covered by this rule\nmay be incented to compete for core deposits to an unexpected extent. Although smaller banks, like ours, are not directly impacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs.\nWe also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets. In 2010 we issued $500 million of senior notes due 2015 in an underwritten offering, in 2013 we issued $100 million (preference amount) of preferred stock, and in 2014 we issued $400 million of senior bank notes due 2019. At year-end all these securities remained outstanding. Presently we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control.\nA number of more general factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the\nlegal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control.\nEvents affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our capital markets business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. In recent years, including most recently in 2013, we have experienced downgrades by the various agencies at various times. At December 31, 2014, two of the three rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation as investment grade, and all three rated such debt of the Bank as investment grade, although we were at or near the lowest levels of investment grade. The ratings outlook from all three ratings agencies was stable for both the Corporation and the Bank. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to\nbuy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nReductions in our credit ratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which have ratings triggers reference the lower of S&P\u2019s or Moody\u2019s ratings. Based on those ratings, for some time we have been required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. Should a credit rating downgrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have been required to post is approximately $7 million as of December 31, 2014. Due to the retirement of certain debt after year-end, at January 31, 2015 this amount had decreased to approximately $1 million.\nReductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold.\nInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks\nWe are subject to interest rate risk as a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates.\nA flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and capital markets businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be\nrelatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our capital markets business. A goal and effect of certain actions by the Federal Reserve over the past few years has been to flatten the yield curve, and our net interest margin has declined over this period.\nExpectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.\nSecurities Inventories and Market Risks\nThe trading securities inventories we hold in our capital markets business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory positions for purposes of distributions to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with fixed-income securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Capital markets trading securities (long positions) were $1.2 billion at year-end 2014, $.8 billion at year-end 2013, and $1.2 billion at year-end 2012.Trading liabilities (short positions) were $594.3 million, $368.3 million, and $564.4 million at December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption \u201cMarket Risk Management\u201d beginning on page 43 of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2014 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.\nDeclines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.\nSignificant changes to the securities market\u2019s performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results.\nA significant example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims and actuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent the pension plan invests its assets in marketable securities, primarily fixed income but also equities. Our obligations to fund the\nplan can diminish substantially if the plan\u2019s investments perform well, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Relative to conditions in 2014, a rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan and also could negatively impact the stock market generally. Similarly, our obligations can grow or diminish substantially with changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs. In 2014, for example, mortality expectations changed to reflect increased longevity and, correspondingly, an increased funding obligation.\nChanges in our funding obligation generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Although our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself, declines in market performance tend to increase our obligations to fund the pension plan. We froze new plan benefits after 2012, and in 2011 we changed the plan\u2019s asset allocation investment strategy. Although we expect those changes to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable. That risk of volatility would be amplified if certain actuarial assumptions change adversely, especially the discount rate used to estimate the projected benefit obligation, or if the accounting rules regarding pension liability estimates change adversely.\nOur hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequately hedge our risks and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our capital markets unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps, swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally, in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans.\nHedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.\nAccounting Risks\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of our most critical estimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses; and the level of repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, we are entirely unable to make estimates.\nWe lack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example, interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectability and inherent loss of a performing junior lien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institution\u2019s income recognition policy should incorporate management\u2019s consideration of all reasonably available information including, for junior liens, the performance of the associated senior liens as well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We own and service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. As of December 31, 2014, that amount was $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $21.1 billion or 41 percent of the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens. We own or service approximately 7 percent\nof the first liens that are senior to these stand-alone second liens. We are not able to actively monitor the performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others. We obtain first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation activities, and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performance issues with the first lien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improve our additions to nonperforming loans may be material.\nA reduction in our taxable earnings outlook could adversely affect the value of our deferred tax asset, as could a reduction in our corporate income tax rate. We have a net deferred tax asset accumulated during recent years. At December 31, 2014 our gross deferred tax asset after valuation allowance was approximately $370.4 million and the net deferred tax asset was approximately $284.4 million. The value of our deferred tax asset depends in part upon our estimation of our ability to realize the asset during applicable future periods and upon our estimate of our effective tax rate. A significant adverse change in our taxable earnings outlook could result in an impairment of the value of our deferred tax asset. Also, future enactment by Congress of tax rate reductions could result in impairment.\nChanges in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry.\nChanges in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting rules. Changes in those rules can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting.\nRisks of Holding our Stock\nThe principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay substantial dividends to us without regulatory approval.\nWe primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our stockholders. Regulatory constraints may prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in 2015 without regulatory\napproval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bank had negative $75.7 million and negative $141.6 million, respectively, available for dividends. In contrast, on January 1, 2015, the Bank\u2019s total amount available for dividends was a positive number, $15.1 million. That amount will grow in 2015 only to the extent that the Bank\u2019s earnings for the year exceed preferred and any common dividends for the year.\nAlso, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company\u2019s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company\u2019s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective\nfinancial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. As mentioned above, the capital requirements applicable to us have changed, becoming more strict, starting in 2015.\nOur stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to stockholders.\nProvisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 36397, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FHN"}
