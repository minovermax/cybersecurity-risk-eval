{"cik": "1400891", "company": "iHeartMedia, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nTo service our debt obligations and to fund our operations and our capital expenditures, we require a significant amount of cash to meet our needs, which depends on many factors beyond our control\nOur ability to service our debt obligations and to fund our operations and our capital expenditures requires a significant amount of cash. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under iHeartCommunications' receivables based credit facility, subject to certain limitations contained in iHeartCommunications' material financing agreements, to help meet our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2016, we had $845.0 million of cash on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, we had a borrowing base of $480.4 million under iHeartCommunications' receivables based credit facility, had $330.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $36.8 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $113.6 million of excess availability. However, any incremental borrowings under iHeartCommunications' receivables based credit facility may be further limited by the terms contained in iHeartCommunications' material financing agreements. Due to the seasonal variations in our business, we made a repayment of $25.0 million on January 31, 2017, and we expect our borrowing base and excess availability to decrease in the first quarter of 2017. As a result, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under this facility during the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management\u2019s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. We adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2016. Under this standard, we are required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating our ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after our financial statements were issued (February 23, 2017). Management considered our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our conditional and unconditional obligations due before February 23, 2018. Our forecasted future cash flows indicates that such cash flows would not be sufficient for us to meet our obligations, including payment of the outstanding balance on our receivables based credit facility, which has a maturity of December 24, 2017, as they become due in the ordinary course of business for 12 months following February 23, 2017. We plan to refinance or extend the receivables based credit facility to a date at least 12 months after February 23, 2017 with terms similar to the facility's current terms. We believe the refinancing or extension of the maturity of the receivables based credit facility is probable of being executed as we have successfully extended the maturity date of this receivables based credit facility in the past and the facility has a first-priority lien on the accounts receivable of iHeartCommunications and certain of its subsidiaries. Our plan to refinance or extend the due date of the receivables based credit facility, combined with current funds and expected future cash flows, are considered to be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business for a period of 12 months following the date these financial statements are issued. While we currently plan to refinance or extend the maturity of the receivables based credit facility and have begun discussing such refinancing or extension with our receivables based credit facility lenders, there is no assurance that the receivables based credit facility will be refinanced or extended in a timely manner, in amounts that are sufficient to meet the Company's obligations as they become due, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Anticipated Cash Requirements.\u201d Our ability to meet our obligations as they become due in the ordinary course of business for the next 12 months will depend on our ability to achieve forecasted results and our ability to refinance or extend the maturity of our receivables based credit facility. In 2016, we drew a net aggregate of $100.0 million under our receivables based credit facility to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and interest payment obligations, and,\nsince the beginning of 2016, we completed several transactions as described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Anticipated Cash Requirements.\u201d These transactions improved our liquidity position in the short term, but our annual cash interest payment obligations increased as a result. We anticipate paying cash interest of approximately $1.7 billion during 2017. If we are unable to continue to obtain sources of refinancing or generate sufficient cash through our operations and liquidity-generating transactions, or if we are unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our receivables based credit facility, we could face substantial liquidity problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet iHeartCommunications' obligations.\nOur results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions\nWe derive revenues from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 resulted in a decline in advertising and marketing by our customers, which resulted in a decline in advertising revenues across our businesses. This reduction in advertising revenues had an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Global economic conditions have been slow to recover and remain uncertain. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, economic uncertainty increases or economic conditions deteriorate again, global economic conditions may once again adversely impact our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate revenues in specific markets is directly affected by local and regional conditions, and unfavorable regional economic conditions also may adversely impact our results. In addition, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, an individual business sector or market may experience a downturn, causing it to reduce its advertising expenditures, which also may adversely impact our results.\nWe face intense competition in our iHeartMedia and our outdoor advertising businesses\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenues. Our iHeartMedia and our outdoor advertising businesses compete for audiences and advertising revenues with other radio and outdoor advertising businesses, as well as with other media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, portable digital audio players, mobile devices, satellite radio, Internet-based services and live entertainment, within their respective markets. Audience ratings and market shares are subject to change for various reasons, including through consolidation of our competitors through processes such as mergers and acquisitions, which could have the effect of reducing our revenues in a specific market. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It also is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of our business segments. An increased level of competition for advertising dollars may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match.\nAlternative media platforms and technologies may continue to increase competition with our broadcasting operations\nOur terrestrial radio broadcasting operations face increasing competition from alternative media platforms and technologies, such as broadband wireless, satellite radio, audio broadcasting by cable television systems and Internet-based streaming music services, as well as consumer products, such as portable digital audio players and other mobile devices, smart phones and tablets, gaming consoles, in-home entertainment and enhanced automotive platforms. These technologies and alternative media platforms, including those used by us, compete with our broadcast radio stations for audience share and advertising revenues. We are unable to predict the effect that such technologies and related services and products will have on our broadcasting operations. The capital expenditures necessary to implement these or other technologies could be substantial and we cannot assure you that we will continue to have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services to compete with other new technologies or services, or that our investments in new technologies or services will provide the desired returns. Other companies employing new technologies or services could more successfully implement such new technologies or services or otherwise increase competition with our businesses.\nOur iHeartMedia business is dependent upon the performance of on-air talent and program hosts\nWe employ or independently contract with many on-air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective markets. Although we have entered into long-term agreements with some of our key on-air talent and program hosts to protect our interests in those relationships, we can give no assurance that all or any of these persons will remain with us or will retain their audiences. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of these individuals are under no legal obligation to remain with us. Our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which we may be unwilling to meet. Furthermore, the popularity and audience loyalty of our key on-air talent and program hosts is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes. A loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to attract local and/or national advertisers and on our revenue and/or ratings, and could result in increased expenses.\nOur business is dependent on our management team and other key individuals\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of our management team and other key individuals. Although we have entered into agreements with some members of our management team and certain other key individuals, we can give no assurance that all or any of our management team and other key individuals will remain with us, or that we won\u2019t continue to make changes to the composition of, and the roles and responsibilities of, our management team. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no legal obligation to remain with us, and may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. If members of our management or key individuals decide to leave us in the future, if we decide to make further changes to the composition of, or the roles and responsibilities of, these individuals, or if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining other key employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control\nCertain factors that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, decreasing overall revenues, the numbers of advertising customers, advertising fees or profit margins include:\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u2022\nour inability to successfully adopt or our being late in adopting technological changes and innovations that offer more attractive advertising or listening alternatives than what we offer, which could result in a loss of advertising customers or lower advertising rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance;\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential new royalties charged for terrestrial radio broadcasting, which could materially increase our expenses;\n\u2022\nunfavorable shifts in population and other demographics, which may cause us to lose advertising customers as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence or which may cause advertisers to be willing to pay less in advertising fees if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective;\n\u2022\nadverse political effects and acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions, which may impair our ability to operate or require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit of the U.K. from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". International outdoor is currently headquartered in the U.K. and transacts business in many key European markets. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. It is unclear how these negotiations will impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. and other countries. This uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce the amount they spend on advertising. In addition, the announcement of Brexit caused the British pound's currency rate to weaken against the U.S. dollar. Any of these or similar effects of Brexit could adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe success of our street furniture and transit products businesses is dependent on our obtaining key municipal concessions, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms\nOur street furniture and transit products businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and transit authorities. Many of these contracts, which require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal, typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy and substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids.\nOur competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not been, and most likely in the future will not be, awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, be able to renew existing contracts or be able to replace any revenue lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts may also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity.\nThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to estimate accurately the revenue derived from and the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter expenses and delays if our competitors challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nOur inability to successfully negotiate, renew or complete these contracts due to third-party or governmental demands and delay and the highly competitive bidding processes for these contracts could affect our ability to offer these products to our clients, or to offer them to our clients at rates that are competitive to other forms of advertising, without adversely affecting our financial results.\nFuture dispositions, acquisitions and other strategic transactions could pose risks\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to pursue strategic dispositions of certain businesses as well as acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material. Our strategy involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nour dispositions may negatively impact revenues from our national, regional and other sales networks;\n\u2022\nour dispositions may make it difficult to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements, including our and Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.'s (\"CCOH\") debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nour acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows:\n\u2022\nto successfully manage our large portfolio of iHeartMedia, outdoor advertising and other businesses, we may need to:\n\u2022\nrecruit additional senior management as we cannot be assured that senior management of acquired businesses will continue to work for us and we cannot be certain that our recruiting efforts will succeed, and\n\u2022\nexpand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those of acquired businesses, because failure to do so may cause us to lose the benefits of any expansion that we decide to undertake by leading to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or by distracting our management;\n\u2022\nwe may enter into markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nDispositions and acquisitions of media and entertainment businesses and outdoor advertising businesses may require antitrust review by U.S. federal antitrust agencies and may require review by foreign antitrust agencies under the antitrust laws of foreign jurisdictions. We can give no assurances that the DOJ, the FTC or foreign antitrust agencies will not seek to bar us from disposing of or acquiring media and entertainment businesses or outdoor advertising businesses or impose stringent undertaking on our business as a condition to the completion of an acquisition in any market where we already have a significant position. Further, radio acquisitions are subject to FCC approval. Such transactions must comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulatory requirements and policies, including with respect to the number of broadcast facilities in which a person or entity may have an ownership or attributable interest in a given local market and the level of interest that may be held by a foreign individual or entity. The FCC's media ownership rules remain subject to ongoing agency and court proceedings. Future changes could restrict our ability to dispose of or acquire new radio assets or businesses.\nExtensive current government regulation, and future regulation, may limit our radio broadcasting and other iHeartMedia operations or adversely affect our business and financial results\nCongress and several federal agencies, including the FCC, extensively regulate the domestic radio industry. For example, the FCC could impact our profitability by imposing large fines on us if, in response to pending or future complaints, it finds that we broadcast indecent programming or committed other violations of FCC regulations. We could face significant fines, for instance, as a result of pending FCC investigations into the allegedly inappropriate broadcast of emergency alert signals by several of our stations. Additionally, we cannot be sure that the FCC will approve renewal of the licenses we must have in order to operate our stations. Nor can we be assured that our licenses will be renewed without conditions and for a full term. The non-renewal, or conditioned renewal, of a substantial number of our FCC licenses could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. Furthermore, possible changes in interference protections, spectrum allocations and other technical rules may negatively affect the operation of our stations. For example, in January 2011, a law was enacted that eliminates certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and low-power FM radio stations. In March 2011, the FCC adopted policies which, in certain circumstances, could make it more difficult for radio stations to relocate to increase their population coverage. In October 2015,\nthe FCC proposed rules, which could reduce the degree of interference protection afforded to certain of our AM radio stations that serve wide areas. In addition, Congress, the FCC and other regulatory agencies have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies that could, directly or indirectly, have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. For example, Congress may consider and adopt legislation that would impose an obligation upon all U.S. broadcasters to pay performing artists a royalty for the on-air broadcast of their sound recordings (this would be in addition to payments already made by broadcasters to owners of musical work rights, such as songwriters, composers and publishers). Moreover, it is possible that our license fees and negotiating costs associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming content could sharply increase as a result of private negotiations, one or more regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. The CRB recently issued a final determination establishing copyright royalty rates for the public performance and ephemeral reproduction of sound recordings by various noninteractive webcasters, including radio broadcasters that simulcast their terrestrial programming online, to apply to the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 under the webcasting statutory license. The rates set by the CRB represent a decrease from the 2015 CRB rates applicable to broadcasters and other webcasters, but the determination has been appealed. Increased royalty rates could significantly increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, there are conditions applicable to the webcasting statutory license. Some, but not all, record companies have agreed to waive or provide limited relief from certain of these conditions under certain circumstances. Some of these conditions may be inconsistent with customary radio broadcasting practices. Finally, various regulatory matters relating to our iHeartMedia business are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our business.\nGovernment regulation of outdoor advertising may restrict our outdoor advertising operations\nU.S. federal, state and local regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. One of the seminal laws is the HBA, which regulates outdoor advertising on controlled roads in the United States. The HBA regulates the size and location of billboards, mandates a state compliance program, requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. Construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of billboards and the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by federal, state and local governments. From time to time, states and municipalities have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new outdoor advertising structures. Changes in laws and regulations affecting outdoor advertising, or changes in the interpretation of those laws and regulations, at any level of government, including the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could have a significant financial impact on us by requiring us to make significant expenditures or otherwise limiting or restricting some of our operations. Due to such regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to develop new outdoor advertising locations.\nFrom time to time, certain state and local governments and third parties have attempted to force the removal of our displays under various state and local laws, including zoning ordinances, permit enforcement and condemnation. Similar risks also arise in certain of our international jurisdictions. Certain zoning ordinances provide for amortization, which is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Other regulations limit our ability to rebuild, replace, repair, maintain and upgrade non-conforming displays. In addition, from time to time third parties or local governments assert that we own or operate displays that either are not properly permitted or otherwise are not in strict compliance with applicable law. If we are increasingly unable to resolve such allegations or obtain acceptable arrangements in circumstances in which our displays are subject to removal, modification or amortization, or if there occurs an increase in such regulations or their enforcement, our operating results could suffer.\nA number of state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. From time to time, legislation also has been introduced in international jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. In addition, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legislation or interpreted existing legislation to restrict or prohibit the installation of digital billboards, and we expect these efforts to continue. The increased imposition of these measures, and our inability to overcome any such measures, could reduce our operating income if those outcomes require removal or restrictions on the use of preexisting displays or limit growth of digital displays. In addition, if we are unable to pass on the cost of these items to our clients, our operating income could be adversely affected.\nInternational regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations limit the subject matter, animation and language of out-of-home displays. Our failure to comply with these or any future international regulations could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our displays or their attractiveness to clients as an advertising medium and may require us to make\nsignificant expenditures to ensure compliance and avoid certain penalties or contractual breaches. As a result, we may experience a significant impact on our operations, revenue, international client base and overall financial condition.\nRegulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, or any failure to comply with these regulations, could hinder our operations\nWe collect and utilize demographic and other information, including personally identifiable information, from and about our listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers as they interact with us. For example: (1) our broadcast radio station websites and our iHeartRadio digital platform collect personal information as users register for our services, fill out their listener profiles, post comments, use our social networking features, participate in polls and contests and sign-up to receive email newsletters; (2) we use tracking technologies, such as \u201ccookies,\u201d to manage and track our listeners\u2019 interactions with us so that we can deliver relevant music content and advertising; and (3) we collect credit card or debit card information from consumers, business partners and advertisers who use our services.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to collect, use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers. Such restrictions could limit our ability to provide customized music content to our listeners, interact directly with our listeners and consumers and offer targeted advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, we could lose valuable information, suffer disruptions to our business, and incur expenses and liabilities including damages to our relationships with listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers\nAlthough we have implemented physical and electronic security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets and proprietary business information as well as listener, consumer, business partner and advertiser personally identifiable information, no security measures are perfect and impenetrable and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations, information processes or internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed, we could lose listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer financial exposure in connection with penalties, remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings and changes in our security and system protection measures. Currently, not all of our systems are fully compliant with PCI-DSS standards and, as a result, we may face additional liability in the event of a security breach involving payment card information.\nRestrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products may restrict the categories of clients that can advertise using our products\nOut-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Other products and services may be targeted in the U.S. in the future, including alcohol products. Most European Union countries, among other nations, also have banned outdoor advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising. Regulations vary across the countries in which we conduct business. Any significant reduction in advertising of products due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenues from such advertisements and an increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.\nEnvironmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations may limit or restrict some of our operations\nAs the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, especially in our outdoor advertising operations, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety as well as zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, additional laws which may be passed in the future, or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws, could require us to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict some of our operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because a portion of our revenue is received in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions, including Brexit, in any of the foreign countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other currency restrictions being imposed. Because we receive a portion of our revenues in currencies from the countries in which we operate, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability. A portion of our cash flows are generated in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and certain of the indebtedness held by our international subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, and, therefore, significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on our indebtedness.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on our operating income as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDoing business in foreign countries exposes us to certain risks not expected to occur when doing business in the United States\nDoing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found when doing business in the United States. These risks could result in losses against which we are not insured. Examples of these risks include:\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;\n\u2022\nhostility from local populations;\n\u2022\nthe adverse effect of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u2022\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nexpropriations of property without adequate compensation;\n\u2022\nthe potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u2022\nthe risk of insurrections;\n\u2022\nrisks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties collecting receivables and otherwise enforcing contracts with governmental agencies and others in some foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax structure and level; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of laws or regulations.\nOur International operations involve contracts with, and regulation by, foreign governments. We operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nSignificant equity investors control us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future\nPrivate equity funds sponsored by or co-investors with Bain Capital and THL currently indirectly control us through their ownership of all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, which collectively represent approximately 68% of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Bain Capital and THL have the power to elect all but two of our directors, appoint new management and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of our capital stock, including adopting any amendments to our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or assets. The directors elected by Bain Capital and THL will have significant authority to make decisions affecting us, including the issuance of additional capital stock, change in control transactions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends.\nIn addition, affiliates of Bain Capital and THL are lenders under iHeartCommunications' term loan credit facilities and holders of iHeartCommunications' priority guarantee notes due 2019. It is possible that their interests in some circumstances may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders.\nAdditionally, Bain Capital and THL are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or more of the entities advised by or affiliated with Bain Capital and/or THL may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as entities advised by or affiliated with Bain Capital and THL directly or indirectly own a significant amount of the voting power of our outstanding equity interests, even if such amount is less than 50%, Bain Capital and THL will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nas a result of the risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nreasons unrelated to operating performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes that could impact our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions.\nShares of our Class A common stock are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets. The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to sell their shares of Class A common stock at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our Class A common stock.\nThere is no assurance that holders of our Class A common stock will ever receive cash dividends\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and there is no guarantee that we will ever pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the future. The terms of our financing arrangements and other debt restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock. In addition to those restrictions, under Delaware law, we are permitted to pay cash dividends on our capital stock only out of our surplus, which in general terms means the excess of our net assets over the original aggregate par value of our stock. In the event we have no surplus, we are permitted to pay these cash dividends out of our net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or in the immediately preceding year. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that, if we wish to pay cash dividends, we would be able to do so pursuant to Delaware law. Also, even if we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends by the terms of our financing agreements or by law, other factors such as the need to reinvest cash back into our operations may prompt our Board of Directors to elect not to pay cash dividends.\nWe may terminate our Exchange Act reporting, if permitted by applicable law\nIf at any time our Class A common stock is held by fewer than 300 holders of record, we will be permitted to cease to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act to the extent we are not otherwise required to continue to report pursuant to any contractual agreements, including with respect to any of our indebtedness. If we were to cease filing reports under the Exchange Act, the information now available to our stockholders in the annual, quarterly and other reports we currently file with the SEC would not be available to them as a matter of right.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe substantial amount of indebtedness of our subsidiary, iHeartCommunications, and its subsidiaries, may adversely affect our liquidity, our cash flows and our ability to operate our business and make us more vulnerable to changes in the economy or our industry\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, we had $20.4 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, including: (1) $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under iHeartCommunications' term loan D credit facility, which matures in January 2019 and $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under iHeartCommunications' term loan E credit facility, which matures in July 2019; (2) $330.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under iHeartCommunications' receivables based credit facility, which matures in December 2017; (3) $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' 9.0% priority guarantee notes due 2019, which mature in December 2019; (4) $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' 9.0% priority guarantee notes due 2021, net of $25.3 million of unamortized discounts, which mature in March 2021; (5) $575.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' 11.25% priority guarantee notes due 2021, which mature in March 2021; (6) $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' 9.0% priority guarantee notes due 2022, net of $2.0 million of unamortized premiums, which mature in September 2022; (7) $950.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications'\n10.625% priority guarantee notes due 2023, which mature in March 2023; (8) $21.0 million aggregate principal amount of other secured debt; (9) $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' 14.0% senior notes due 2021, net of $12.0 million of unamortized discounts and net of $440.6 million held by a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications, which mature in February 2021; (10) $350.1 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' Legacy Notes, which mature in June 2018 and October 2027, net of unamortized purchase accounting discounts of $124.9 million and net of $57.1 million of 5.5% senior notes due 2016, which matured in December 2016, but were not repaid and continue to be outstanding and are held by a subsidiary of iHeartCommunications and are eliminated in consolidation for accounting purposes; (11) $347.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of iHeartCommunications' 10.0% senior notes due 2018, net of $503.0 million held by certain subsidiaries of iHeartCommunications, which mature in January 2018; (12) $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of subsidiary senior notes, net of unamortized discounts of $4.9 million, which mature in November 2022; (13) $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of subsidiary senior subordinated notes, which mature in March 2020; (14) $223.2 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of international subsidiary senior notes, net of unamortized discounts of $1.8 million, which mature in December 2020; and (15) other obligations of $28.0 million. This large amount of indebtedness could have negative consequences for us, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing cash available for other purposes, including to fund operations and capital expenditures, invest in new technology and pursue other business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our liquidity and operational flexibility and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to defer planned capital expenditures, reduce discretionary spending, sell assets, restructure existing indebtedness or defer acquisitions or other strategic opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance any of the indebtedness or increasing the cost of any such financing;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance, a decline in general economic or industry conditions or a disruption in the credit markets; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more susceptible to negative changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nIf compliance with the debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer. The terms of iHeartCommunications' credit facilities and other indebtedness allow us, under certain conditions, to incur further indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, which heightens the foregoing risks.\niHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of their indebtedness, may not be able to refinance all of their indebtedness before it becomes due and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy their obligations under their indebtedness, which may not be successful\niHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make scheduled payments on their respective debt obligations depends on their financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond their or our control. In addition, because iHeartCommunications derives a substantial portion of its operating income from its subsidiaries, iHeartCommunications' ability to repay its debt depends upon the performance of its subsidiaries, their ability to dividend or distribute funds to iHeartCommunications and iHeartCommunications' receipt of funds under its cash management arrangement with its subsidiary, CCOH.\niHeartCommunications and its subsidiaries may not generate cash flow from operations or have cash on hand in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. We anticipate cash interest requirements of approximately $1.7 billion during 2017. At December 31, 2016, we had debt maturities totaling $343.5 million, $559.1 million (net of $503.0 million due to certain subsidiaries of iHeartCommunications) and $8.4 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries' ability to pay their debt maturing over the next 12 months is dependent upon achieving forecasted cash from operations and our ability to refinance or extend the maturity of the receivables based credit facility. We are currently exploring, and expect to continue to explore, a variety of transactions to provide us with additional liquidity or to restructure our indebtedness, and we are seeking to refinance or extend the maturity of the receivables based credit facility. We cannot assure you that we will enter into or consummate any such liquidity-generating or restructuring transactions or that we will be successful in extending the maturity of the receivables based credit facility and we cannot currently predict the impact that any such transactions, if consummated, would have on us.\nIf iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows from operations, refinancing sources and other liquidity-generating or restructuring transactions are insufficient to fund or extend their respective debt service obligations or debt maturities, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, or seek additional capital from other\nsources. We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries to meet the scheduled debt service obligations. Furthermore, these actions may not be permitted under the terms of existing or future debt agreements.\nIf we, iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries cannot make scheduled payments on indebtedness, iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries, as applicable, will be in default under one or more of the debt agreements and, as a result we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur substantial debt service obligations have increased as a result of iHeartCommunications' financing transactions and may continue to do so, which could adversely affect our liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations\nDuring 2015 and 2016, our debt service obligations increased. Future financing transactions and any increase in interest rates may further increase our interest expense. The increase in our debt service obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and our contractual and commercial commitments; and\n\u2022\nit may otherwise further limit us in the ways summarized above under \u201cThe substantial amount of indebtedness of our subsidiary, iHeartCommunications, and its subsidiaries, may adversely affect our liquidity, our cash flows and our ability to operate our business and make us more vulnerable to changes in the economy or our industry,\u201d including by reducing our cash available for operations, debt service obligations, future business opportunities, acquisitions and capital expenditures.\nOur ability to make payments with respect to iHeartCommunications' debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, our ability to complete liquidity-generating transactions and iHeartCommunications' ability to continue to refinance its indebtedness and refinance or extend the maturity of its receivables based credit facility, which will be affected by prevailing economic and credit market conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nBecause we and iHeartCommunications derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries, iHeartCommunications' ability to repay its debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to dividend or distribute funds to us\nWe derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and the ability of iHeartCommunications to service its indebtedness depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and the ability of those entities to distribute funds to us. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay to us the amounts necessary to service iHeartCommunications' debt.\nThe documents governing iHeartCommunications' and its subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business\niHeartCommunications' material financing agreements, including its credit agreements and indentures, contain various covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nmake loans or otherwise extend credit to others;\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness or issue shares or guarantees;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies; and\n\u2022\nmake a substantial change to the general nature of our business.\nIn addition, under iHeartCommunications' senior secured credit facilities, iHeartCommunications is required to comply with certain affirmative covenants and certain specified financial covenants and ratios. For instance, iHeartCommunications' senior secured credit facilities require it to comply on a quarterly basis with a financial covenant limiting the ratio of its consolidated secured debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to its consolidated EBITDA (as defined under the terms of the senior secured credit facilities) for the preceding four quarters. The maximum ratio permitted under this financial covenant for the four quarters ended December 31, 2016 was 8.75 to 1.\nThe restrictions contained in iHeartCommunications' credit agreements and indentures could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions,\ninvestments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, the ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond iHeartCommunications' or our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If any of these covenants or restrictions is breached, iHeartCommunications could be in default under the agreements governing its indebtedness and, as a result, we would be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, limit our financing options, reduce our flexibility under future financings and adversely affect our liquidity, and also may adversely impact our business operations\nThe corporate credit ratings for iHeartCommunications and our indirect subsidiaries, Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCCWH\u201d) and Clear Channel International B.V. (\"CCIBV\"), are speculative-grade. Our corporate credit rating and our rating outlook are subject to review by rating agencies from time to time and, on various occasions, have been downgraded. In the future, our corporate credit ratings and our rating outlook could be further downgraded. These downgrades and any further downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs or increase the cost of doing business or otherwise negatively impact our business operations.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
