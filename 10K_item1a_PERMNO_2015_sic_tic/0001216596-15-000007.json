Investors should carefully consider each of the risks described below, as well as the other information in this report and in our filings with the SEC. The occurrence of any of the following risks could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operation or cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business:\nOur business is affected by global economic conditions.\nOur results of operations are directly influenced by the conditions in the global economy. Recently, U.S. and foreign economies experienced significant declines in employment, household wealth, property values, consumer spending and lending. Businesses, including Nortek and many of its customers, faced and may continue to face weakened demand for products and services, difficulty obtaining access to financing, increased funding costs and barriers to expanding operations. As a result, the economic environment may, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate downward pressure on the pricing of our products;\n\u2022\naffect the collection of accounts receivable in countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and certain other countries in Europe;\n\u2022\nincrease the sales cycle for certain of our products;\n\u2022\nslow the adoption of new technology;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our customers, causing them to reduce spending and/or decrease utilization of our products;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and\n\u2022\nlimit our access to capital on terms acceptable to us.\nAny of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nOur business is dependent upon the levels of remodeling and replacement activity and new construction activity, which may be cyclical or seasonal, and have been negatively impacted by the economic downturn and the instability of the credit markets.\nCritical factors affecting our future performance, including our level of sales, profitability and cash flows are the levels of residential and non-residential remodeling, replacement and construction activity. The level of new residential and non-residential construction activity and, to a lesser extent, the level of residential remodeling and replacement activity are affected by seasonality and cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending, employment levels and other macroeconomic factors, over which we have no control. Any decline in economic activity as a result of these or other factors typically results in a decline in new construction and, to a lesser extent, residential remodeling and replacement purchases, which would result in a decrease in our sales, profitability and cash flows. Instability in the credit and financial markets, troubles in the mortgage market, the level of unemployment and the decline in home values could have a negative impact on residential new construction activity, consumer disposable income and spending on home remodeling and repair expenditures. These factors could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States where inclement weather during the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home improvement and new construction markets. Our lower sales levels usually occur during the first and fourth quarters. Since a high percentage of our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year, operating income and net earnings tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales levels. In addition, the demand for cash to fund the working capital needs of our subsidiaries is greater from late in the first quarter until early in the fourth quarter.\nSee \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, Item 7 of Part II to this report for further information on industry factors and our 2015 outlook.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nFluctuations in the cost or availability of raw materials and components and other related costs could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon raw materials and purchased components, including, among others, steel, copper, aluminum, electronics, motors, plastics, compressors, various chemicals and paints, and packaging that we purchase from third parties. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected by increases in costs of raw materials or components, or by limited availability of these items. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. In addition, we generally do not hedge against our supply requirements. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain raw materials and components from our current or alternative suppliers at reasonable prices in the future, or may not be able to obtain these items on the scale and within the time frames we require. Further, if our suppliers are unable to meet our supply requirements, we could experience supply interruptions and/or cost increases. If we are unable to find alternate suppliers or pass along these additional costs to our customers, these interruptions and/or cost increases could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSources of raw materials or component parts for certain of our operations may be dependent upon limited or sole sources of supply which may impact our ability to manufacture finished product. While we continually review alternative sources of supply, there can be no assurance that we will not face disruptions in sources of supply which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nContinued strategic sourcing initiatives and other improvements in manufacturing efficiency, as well as sales price increases, help to mitigate fluctuations in these costs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset any or all material or other cost increases in any future periods.\nCompliance with regulations regarding the use of \"conflict minerals\" could limit the supply or sources of certain minerals used in the manufacturing of our products.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC promulgated rules for public companies to ascertain and disclose the use of \"conflict minerals\" (i.e., cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, wolframite, and gold) which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. These rules require disclosure of conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rules require companies to perform due diligence and disclose through the issuance of a report whether or not their products contain certain \"conflict minerals\". We are required to conduct due diligence efforts and, as a result, incur additional costs. The rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to source these products in the future. In addition, costs attributable to compliance with the disclosure requirements of the rules, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, have been incurred, will continue to be incurred and could be material. The costs of compliance, including those related to supply chain research, unexpected consequences to our reputation, the limited number of suppliers, and possible changes in the sourcing of these materials, could adversely affect our results from operations and cash flows.\nWeather fluctuations may negatively impact our business.\nWeather fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and our ability to maintain sales volume. In our RCH segment, certain product categories may be adversely affected by unseasonably warm weather in the months of November to February and unseasonably cool weather in the months of May to August, which has the effect of diminishing customer demand for heating and air conditioning products. In all of our segments, adverse weather conditions at any time of the year may negatively affect overall levels of new construction and remodeling and replacement activity, which in turn may lead to a decrease in sales. Many of our operating expenses are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased demand for our products. Accordingly, our results of operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted in quarters with lower sales due to weather fluctuations.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nIf we fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired or will acquire in the future, our business could be negatively impacted.\nHistorically, we have engaged in a significant number of acquisitions, and those acquisitions have contributed significantly to our growth in sales and operating results. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to locate and secure acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates, our growth could be impaired. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and expense that we incur in connection with the acquisition, including those acquisitions that we pursue but do not ultimately consummate;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and expense that we incur in the subsequent integration of the operations of the acquired company into our operations;\n\u2022\nadverse accounting consequences of conforming the acquired company\u2019s accounting policies to our accounting policies;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties and expense of developing, implementing and monitoring systems of internal controls at acquired companies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in operating acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our financial condition due to the timing of the acquisition or the failure to meet operating expectations for the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired company.\nThere is no assurance that any acquisition we have made or may make in the future will be successfully integrated into our on-going operations or that we will achieve any expected cost savings from any acquisition. If the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations, our profitability and cash flows may be impaired and we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write-off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business.\nSee Note 2, \"Acquisitions\", to the consolidated financial statements, Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report.\nThe operational improvement initiatives may not generate the benefits expected.\nIn 2012, we began to develop and implement a comprehensive operational improvement program which includes a number of transformational operational improvement initiatives intended to produce significant improvements in efficiencies and reductions in operating costs and expenses, both in our manufacturing processes and in our administrative functions. The initiatives will result in significant investments and capital expenditures through 2015. Restructurings, facility shutdowns and integration of operations involve numerous risks in their implementation including unforeseen costs, business disruption and management distraction, among others, and may be more costly than expected. As a result, there can be no assurance that the expected costs to be incurred in connection with these initiatives, or the economic benefits expected to be achieved, will occur as contemplated.\nSee \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Operational Improvement Initiatives\", Item 7 of Part II to this report for a description of these operational improvement initiatives and the estimated costs associated therewith.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nWe continue to evaluate potential restructurings, business shutdowns and integrations focused on improving future cash flows of the business.\nWe continue to evaluate potential restructurings, business shutdowns and integrations focused on improving future cash flows of the business. These restructurings, business shutdowns and integrations involve numerous risks in their implementation including unforeseen costs, business disruption, management distraction, and potential asset impairment, among others, and may be unsuccessful. In addition, restructurings of international operations may be more costly due to differing labor laws, business practices and governmental restrictions, processes and requirements.\nSee \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Operational Improvement Initiatives\", Item 7 of Part II to this report, and Note 5, \"Exit and Disposal Activities\", to the consolidated financial statements, Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report.\nOur competitors have substantially greater resources and we face competitive risks that may negatively impact our business.\nOur AQH and AVC segments compete with many domestic and international suppliers in various markets. We compete with suppliers of competitive products primarily on the basis of quality, distribution, delivery and price. Some of our competitors in these markets have greater financial and marketing resources than that of our AQH and AVC segments.\nOur SCS and ERG segments compete with many domestic and international suppliers in various markets. We compete with suppliers of competitive products primarily on the basis of product innovation, quality, delivery and price. Some of our competitors in these markets have greater financial and marketing resources than that of our SCS and ERG segments.\nOur RCH segment competes in its markets primarily on the basis of breadth and quality of its product line, distribution, product availability and price. Most of our residential HVAC competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and the products of certain of our competitors may enjoy greater brand awareness than the products in the segment.\nOur CAS segment competes primarily on the basis of engineering support, quality, design and construction flexibility, and total installed system cost. Most of our competitors in the commercial HVAC market have greater financial and marketing resources and enjoy greater brand awareness than we enjoy.\nCompetitive factors could require us to reduce prices or increase spending on product development, marketing and sales, either of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nBecause we have substantial operations outside the United States, we are subject to the economic and political conditions of the United States and foreign nations.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in several countries outside of the United States. In 2014, we sold products in over 100 countries other than the United States. Foreign net sales, which are attributed based upon the location of our subsidiary responsible for the sale, were approximately 16.5% of consolidated net sales for each of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase;\n\u2022\nan outbreak or escalation of any insurrection, armed conflict or act of terrorism, or other forms of political, social or economic instability, may occur;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters may occur, and local governments may have difficulties in responding to these events;\n\u2022\nthe United States and foreign governments currently regulate import and export of our products and those of our suppliers and may impose additional limitations on imports or exports of our products or the products of our suppliers;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may nationalize foreign assets or engage in other forms of governmental protectionism;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose or increase investment barriers, customs or tariffs, or other restrictions affecting our business;\n\u2022\ndevelopment, implementation and monitoring of systems of internal controls of our international operations, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, may be difficult and expensive; and\n\u2022\nlabor cost inflation and changes in labor practices.\nThe occurrence of any of these conditions could disrupt our business in particular countries or regions of the world, or prevent us from conducting business in particular countries or regions, which could reduce sales and adversely affect profitability. In addition, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries, including our foreign subsidiaries, to meet our debt obligations. If foreign governments impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds or impose or increase taxes on remittances or other payments to us, the amount of dividends and other distributions we receive from our foreign subsidiaries could be reduced, which could reduce the amount of cash available to us to meet our debt obligations.\nOur foreign operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.\nAs discussed under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d Item 3, Part I of this report, we are conducting an internal investigation of certain transactions and payments in China that potentially implicate the FCPA. In addition, we have informed the SEC and the DOJ of these matters and intend to fully cooperate with these agencies in their review.\nAt this time, we are unable to predict, what, if any, action may be taken by the DOJ or SEC or any penalties or remedial measures these agencies may seek, but intend to cooperate with both agencies. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil and criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement or injunctive relief. The imposition of any of these sanctions or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther detecting, investigating, and resolving these matters is expensive and consumes significant time and attention of the Company\u2019s senior management. The Company could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of the Company participating in or curtailment of business operations in those\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\njurisdictions. Any proceedings that may result from this matter could harm relationships with existing customers, distributors and agents and our ability to obtain new customers and partners.\nThe European debt crisis could have a material adverse effect on our European operations.\nThe European debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts have contributed to instability in the global credit markets and may cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in Europe, the United States or other key markets become uncertain or deteriorate, the value of the Euro could decline and the credit market may weaken. The general financial instability in the stressed European countries could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the European Union. If this were to occur, it could adversely affect our European customers and suppliers and in turn may have a materially adverse effect on our European business and results of operations.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations. We report our financial results in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our sales and in certain instances our expenses are denominated in Euros, Canadian dollars, British Pound Sterling, Chinese Renminbi, Mexican Pesos and other foreign currencies. As a result, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to the value of these currencies, our levels of revenue and potentially our profitability will decline since the translation of a certain number of other currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, if the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to the value of these currencies, our levels of revenue and potentially our profitability will increase since the translation of a certain number of other currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent additional U.S. dollars.\nIn certain instances, we enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. At the date the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain or loss arising from the transaction is measured and recorded in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at that date. At each balance sheet date, recorded monetary balances denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar are adjusted to the U.S. dollar using the current exchange rate with gains or losses recorded in currency translation adjustment and other, net. In addition, in the case of sales to customers in certain locations, our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, Canadian dollars, or British Pound Sterling but all or a substantial portion of our associated costs are denominated in a different currency. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars, Euros, Canadian dollars, British Pound Sterling, and Chinese Renminbi and any such different currency will affect our profitability and cash flows.\nVarying international business practices may adversely impact our business and reputation.\nWe currently purchase raw materials, components and finished products from various foreign suppliers. To the extent that any such foreign supplier utilizes labor or other practices that vary from those commonly accepted in the United States, our business and reputation could be adversely affected by any resulting litigation, negative publicity, political pressure, or otherwise.\nA decline in our relations with key distributors and dealers, loss of major customers or failures or delays in collecting payments from major customers may negatively impact our business.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to maintain relations with our independent distributors and dealers and we do not typically enter into long-term contracts with them. If our key distributors or dealers are unwilling to continue selling our products, or if any of them merge with or are purchased by a competitor, we could experience a decline in sales. If we are unable to replace such distributors or dealers or otherwise replace the resulting loss of sales, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For 2014, approximately 52% of our consolidated net sales were made through our independent distributors and dealers, and our largest distributor or dealer accounted for approximately 4% of consolidated net sales for 2014.\nIn addition, the loss of one or more of our other major customers, or a substantial decrease in such customers' purchases from us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Because we do not generally have binding long-term purchasing agreements with our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing customers will continue to purchase products from us. Our largest customer (other than a distributor or dealer) accounted for approximately 4% of consolidated net sales for each of 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nLabor disruptions or cost increases could adversely affect our business.\nA work stoppage at one of our facilities could cause us to lose sales, incur increased costs and adversely affect our ability to meet customers\u2019 needs. A plant shutdown or a substantial modification to employment terms (including the collective bargaining agreements affecting our unionized employees) could result in material gains or losses or the recognition of an asset impairment. Beginning in 2014, certain ports on the west coast of the United States have been operating below capacity due to a work slow-down led by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (the \u201cLongshore Union\u201d). Although a tentative agreement between the Pacific Maritime Association and the Longshore Union has been reached, the work slow-down has impacted our business, and a continued work slow-down or strike by the Longshore Union could further impact our business operations. As collective bargaining agreements expire and until negotiations are completed, it is not known whether we will be able to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements, or at all, without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. At December 31, 2014, approximately 4% of our employees were unionized, and from time to time we experience union organizing efforts directed at our non-union employees. We may also experience labor cost increases or disruptions in our non-union facilities in circumstances where we must compete for employees with necessary skills and experience or in tight labor markets.\nWe must continue to innovate and improve our products to maintain our competitive advantage.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our market share depends in part on the ability to continue to develop high quality, innovative products. An important part of our competitive strategy includes leveraging our distributor and dealer relationships and our existing brands to introduce new products. In addition, certain of our products must be designed and manufactured to meet various regulatory standards. We must continue to modify regulated products to meet applicable standards as such standards develop and become more stringent over time. We cannot assure you that our investments in product innovation and technological development will be sufficient or that we will be able to create and market new products to enable us to successfully compete with new products or technologies developed by our competitors or to meet heightened regulatory requirements in the future.\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur RCH and CAS segments could be directly impacted by changes in legislation or government regulations relating to changes in environmental and energy efficiency standards which may have a significant impact on the types of products that we or our competitors are permitted to develop and sell. Our inability or delay in developing or marketing products that match customer demand and that meet applicable environmental and efficiency standards could negatively impact our business. The new regional efficiency standards for certain air conditioning and heat pump products that became effective January 1, 2015 will likely result in the sales mix of these products substantially changing over time as inventories of older products are phased out. This may create an unsettled market that could impact demand and margins. The demand for our products and services could also be affected by the size and availability of tax incentives for purchasers of our products and services. Future legislation or regulations, including relating to environmental or efficiency matters, product certification, product liability, taxes, tax incentives and other matters, may impact the results of our operating segments and our consolidated results.\nCertain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance. For example, the United States and other countries have established programs for limiting the production, importation and use of certain ozone depleting chemicals, including hydrochlorofluorocarbons, a refrigerant used in our air conditioning and heat pump products. Some of these chemicals have been banned completely, and others have been phased out in the United States. Modifications to the design of our products have been made, and further modifications may be necessary, in order to utilize alternative refrigerants.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nWe could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws.\nWe could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws, or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. Certain environmental laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, relating to the existence of contamination at or associated with properties used in our current and former operations, or those of our predecessors, or at locations to which current or former operations or those of our predecessors have shipped waste for disposal. Contaminants have been detected at certain of our former sites, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third-party waste disposal sites. While we are not currently aware of any such sites as to which material outstanding claims or obligations exist, the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites could result in significant liability. In addition, we cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to material environmental liabilities or an increase in compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks of litigation and liability claims on product liability, workers\u2019 compensation and other matters, the extent of which exposure can be difficult or impossible to estimate and which can negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters, including contract and employment claims, product liability claims, which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status, warranty claims and claims for modification, adjustment or replacement of component parts of units sold. Product liability and other legal proceedings include those related to businesses we have acquired or properties we have previously owned or operated.\nThe development, manufacture, sale and use of our products involves risks of product liability claims, which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status, and warranty claims, including personal injury and property damage arising from fire, soot, mold and carbon monoxide. We currently carry insurance and maintain reserves for potential product liability claims. However, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business. The accounting for self-insured plans requires that significant judgments and estimates be made both with respect to the future liabilities to be paid for known claims, and incurred but not reported claims, as of the reporting date. To date, we have been able to obtain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate to cover such liability. However, our insurance premiums may increase in the future as a consequence of conditions in the insurance business generally, or our situation in particular. Any such increase could result in lower profits or cause us to reduce our insurance coverage. In addition, a future claim may be brought against us, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Any product liability claim may also include the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to certain state laws, may not be covered by insurance. Our product liability insurance policies have limits that, if exceeded, may result in material costs that would have an adverse effect on future profitability. In addition, warranty claims are generally not covered by our product liability insurance. Further, any product liability or warranty issues may adversely affect our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProduct recalls or reworks may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the event we produce a product that is alleged to contain a design or manufacturing defect or that causes injury, we could incur costs relating to product recalls, litigation or liability claims, rework of the product, or government action. While we have undertaken several voluntary product recalls and reworks over the past several years and could do so in the future given the nature of our business, additional product recalls and/or reworks could result in material future costs. Many of our products, especially certain models of bath fans, range hoods, and residential furnaces and air conditioners, have a large installed base, and any recalls and/or reworks related to products with a large installed base could be particularly costly. The costs of product recalls or reworks are not generally covered by insurance. In addition, our reputation for safety and quality is essential to maintaining market share and protecting our brands. Any recalls or reworks may adversely affect our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nOur business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lost members of our management team or key employees.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers, key employees and consultants, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to retain and motivate them. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, key employees or consultants could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy.\nOur business operations could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, if we fail to comply with the terms of our licenses or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.\nWe are highly dependent on certain of the brand names under which we sell our products. Failure to protect these brand names and other intellectual property rights or to prevent their unauthorized use by third parties could adversely affect our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements. These protections may not be adequate to prevent competitors from using our brand names and trademarks without authorization or from copying our products or developing products equivalent to or superior to ours. We license several brand names from third parties. In the event we fail to comply with the terms of these licenses, we could lose the right to use these brand names. In addition, we face the risk of claims that we are infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any such claim, even if it is without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming; could cause us to cease making, using, or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property; could require us, if feasible, to redesign our products; could divert management time and attention; and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.\nSecurity breaches, improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data and other disruptions or misuse of information systems we rely upon could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively.\nWe, like most companies, may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunication failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. From time to time, we may implement enterprise resource planning systems or add applications to replace outdated systems and to operate more efficiently. Predictions regarding benefits resulting from the implementation of these projects are subject to uncertainties. We may not be able to successfully implement the projects without experiencing difficulties. In addition, any expected benefits of implementing projects might not be realized or the costs of implementation might outweigh the benefits realized.\nWe also outsource various information systems to third party service providers. Despite our security measures as well as those of our business partners and third-party service providers, the information systems we rely upon may be vulnerable to interruption or damage from computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination thereof. These information systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to attack. While we have implemented controls and taken other preventative actions to strengthen these systems against future attacks, we can give no assurance that these controls and preventative actions will be effective. Cybersecurity breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers, partners, suppliers, or employees. Any breach of data security could result in a disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could harm our reputation, require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue.\nVolatility in the capital markets could necessitate increased cash contributions by us to our pension plans to maintain required levels of funding.\nVolatility in the capital markets may have a significant impact on the funding status of our defined benefit pension plans. If the performance of the capital markets depresses the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or increases the liabilities, our plans may be underfunded and we would have to make contributions to the pension plans. The amount of contributions we may be required to make to our pension plans in the future is uncertain and could be significant, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. See Note 13, \"Pension, Profit Sharing and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\", to the consolidated financial statements, Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nFuture tax law changes or the interpretation of existing tax laws may materially impact our effective income tax rate and the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits.\nOur businesses are subject to income taxation in the U.S. as well as internationally. It is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material adverse impact on our worldwide income tax provision. We are routinely audited by income tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Although we believe that the recorded tax estimates are reasonable and appropriate, there are significant uncertainties in these estimates. As a result, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a material adverse effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in our financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement. See Note 8, \"Income Taxes\", to the consolidated financial statements, Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness:\nOur substantial debt could negatively impact our business, prevent us from fulfilling outstanding debt obligations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1,346.3 million of total debt outstanding, which is net of approximately $4.8 million of unamortized debt premium and approximately $1.9 million of unamortized debt discount. The terms of our outstanding debt, including our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201c8.5% Notes\u201d), our 10% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"10% Notes\"), our $300.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) and our $350.0 million senior secured term loan due 2020 (\"Term Loan Facility\") limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt. If additional debt is added to current debt levels, the related risks described below could intensify.\nOur substantial debt has or could have important adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing indebtedness or other purposes could be impaired;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for expansion or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe are more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe are vulnerable to interest rate increases, as certain of our borrowings, including those under the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility, are at variable rates;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the restrictions in our financing agreements would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to meet our obligations under certain of our borrowings;\n\u2022\nwe are more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions than companies with less or no debt;\n\u2022\nwe face limitations on our ability to make strategic acquisitions, invest in new products or capital assets or take advantage of business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nwe are limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate.\nSee Note 4, \"Notes, Mortgage Notes and Obligations Payable\", to the consolidated financial statements, Item 8 of Part II, included elsewhere in this report.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nThe terms of our debt covenants impose restrictions on how we conduct our business and could limit our ability to raise additional funds.\nThe agreements that govern the terms of our debt, including the respective indentures that govern our 8.5% Notes and our 10% Notes and the credit agreements that govern our ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility, contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other payment or distributions;\n\u2022\nmake loans or investments;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell assets.\nThere are limitations on our ability to incur the full $300.0 million of commitments under the ABL Facility. Availability is limited to the lesser of the borrowing base under the ABL Facility and $300.0 million. As of February 23, 2015, we had approximately $95.0 million in outstanding borrowings and approximately $12.1 million in outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Facility. Based on the borrowing base calculations as of January 2015, at February 23, 2015, we had excess availability of approximately $192.9 million under the ABL Facility and approximately $155.4 million of excess availability before triggering the cash deposit requirements.\nWe will be required to deposit cash daily from our material deposit accounts (including all concentration accounts) into collection accounts maintained with the administrative agent under the ABL Facility, which will be used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralized letters of credit, if (i) excess availability (as defined in the ABL Facility) falls below the greater of $30.0 million or 12.5% of the borrowing base or (ii) an event of default has occurred and is continuing. In addition, under the ABL Facility, if (i) excess availability falls below the greater of $30.0 million or 12.5% of the borrowing base or (ii) an event of default has occurred and is continuing, we will be required to satisfy and maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio measured on a trailing four quarter basis of not less than 1.0 to 1.0. Our ability to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio can be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the ABL Facility.\nA breach of the covenants under the indentures that govern our 8.5% Notes and 10% Notes or the credit agreements that govern the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indenture or credit agreement. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the ABL Facility would permit the lenders under the ABL Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our ABL Facility or Term Loan Facility, the lenders to the ABL Facility or the Term Loan Facility, respectively, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our noteholders or lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we can provide no assurances that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns;\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities; or\n\u2022\nunable to grow in accordance with our plans.\nSee \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Covenant Compliance\", Item 7 of Part II, to this report.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and other liquidity requirements and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy such requirements, which may not be successful.\nWe will be required to repay all amounts outstanding under our ABL Facility in 2017, our 10% Notes by 2018, our Term Loan Facility in 2020, and our 8.5% Notes by 2021. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding borrowings under these obligations of approximately $1,336.4 million (net of unamortized debt premium of approximately $4.8 million related to our 8.5% Notes and unamortized debt discount of approximately $1.6 million related to our Term Loan Facility). We are currently obligated to make periodic interest payments under the 8.5% Notes, the 10% Notes, and the ABL Facility, as well as make periodic interest and principal payments relating to the Term Loan Facility and other indebtedness of our subsidiaries. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe expect that we will need to access the capital markets in the future in order to refinance all amounts outstanding under the 8.5% Notes, the 10% Notes, the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility, as we do not anticipate generating sufficient cash flow from operations to repay such amounts in full. We cannot assure you that funds will be available to us in the capital markets, together with cash generated from operations, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nFor further information regarding our yearly contractual obligations and sources of liquidity, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations\", Item 7 of Part II, to this report.\nIf we are unable to access funds generated by our subsidiaries, we may not be able to meet our financial obligations.\nBecause we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends, distributions and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Legal restrictions in the United States and foreign jurisdictions applicable to our subsidiaries and contractual restrictions in certain agreements governing current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. All of our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation whatsoever to pay any dividends, distributions or other payments to us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock:\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of similar public companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is generally less than that of many of our publicly traded competitors and other diversified manufacturing companies. Public companies such as us, with a relatively concentrated level of institutional shareholders, often have difficulty generating trading volume in their stock. This illiquidity can result in relative price discounts as compared to industry peers or to the stock's inherent value. It can also result in limited or no research analyst coverage, the absence of which may make it difficult for a company to establish and hold a market following. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control.\nNORTEK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2014\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our common stock price could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. Since our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, there has been minimal coverage of Nortek by securities analysts. If we do not have analyst coverage of our common stock, we may lack visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock or its trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our common stock or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe overall market and the price of our common stock may fluctuate greatly. The trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in investors' and analysts' perception of the business risks and conditions of our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of financial analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nunfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock prices of our peer companies or in stock markets in general;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with our debt covenants; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions.\nThe market price for our common stock could also fall if our existing significant stockholders, or management, sell, or attempt to sell, large amounts of our common stock. Alternatively, if these stockholders do not trade their shares, our common stock could be thinly traded resulting in a wide spread of bid and ask prices for our common stock, which could reduce the trading volume of our common stock.\nOur significant stockholder may exert significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with yours and they may make decisions with which you may disagree.\nFunds affiliated with Ares Management LLC own, in the aggregate, approximately 38% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as of February 23, 2015 and other stockholders also own significant portions of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting individually or together, control substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of equity ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that you would not approve or make decisions with which you may disagree.\nFurther, our bylaws and certificate of incorporation allow a majority of our stockholders to take action by written consent, rather than at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. These provisions could result in a majority of our stockholders acting quickly to take action that may be opposed to management.", "PERMNO": 13112, "SIC": 3585, "TIC": "NTK"}
