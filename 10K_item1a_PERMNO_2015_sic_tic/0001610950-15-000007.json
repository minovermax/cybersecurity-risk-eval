{"cik": "1610950", "company": "INC Research Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. In evaluating our company, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not generate a large number of new business awards, or if new business awards are delayed, terminated, reduced in scope or fail to go to contract, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to generate new business awards from new and existing customers and maintain existing customer contracts for clinical development services and other services. Our inability to generate new business awards on a timely basis and subsequently enter into contracts for such awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe time between when a study is awarded and when it goes to contract is typically several months, and prior to a new business award going to contract, our customers can cancel the award without notice. Once an award goes to contract, the majority of our customers can terminate the contract with 30 days' notice. Our contracts may be delayed or terminated by our customers or reduced in scope for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecisions to forego or terminate a particular trial;\n\u2022\nbudgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u2022\nactions by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nproduction problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested;\n\u2022\nfailure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;\n\u2022\nunexpected or undesired clinical results for products;\n\u2022\ninsufficient patient enrollment in a trial;\n\u2022\ninsufficient principal investigator recruitment;\n\u2022\nshift of business to a competitor or internal resources; or\n\u2022\nproduct withdrawal following market launch.\nAs a result, contract terminations, delays and modifications are a regular part of our business. In the event of termination, our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual and non-cancellable expenditures and may include a fee to cover a percentage of the remaining professional fees on the project. These fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates and therefore lower operating margins. In addition, cancellation of a clinical trial for the reasons noted above may result in the unwillingness or inability of our customer to satisfy certain associated accounts receivable, which may in turn result in a material impact to our results of operations and cash flow. Historically, cancellations and delays have negatively impacted our operating results. In addition, we might not realize the full benefits of our backlog if our customers cancel, delay or reduce their commitments to us, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large business award or the loss or delay of multiple awards could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability. Additionally, a change in the timing of a new business award could affect the period over which we recognize revenue and reduce our revenue in any one quarter.\nOur backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all of the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog.\nBacklog consists of anticipated net service revenue awarded from contract and pre-contract commitments that are supported by written communications. Once work begins on a project, revenue is recognized over the duration of the project, provided the award has gone to contract. Projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities for reasons beyond our control. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, if a customer terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the termination date and subsequent customer-authorized services related to terminating the canceled project. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the future revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract termination or subsequent changes in scope that reduce the value of the contract. The duration of the projects included in our backlog, and the related revenue recognition, typically range from a few months to several years. Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog. A number of factors may affect backlog, including:\n\u2022\nthe size, complexity and duration of projects or strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nthe cancellation or delay of projects;\n\u2022\nthe failure of one or more business awards to go to contract; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the scope of work during the course of projects.\nThe rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time. The revenue recognition on larger, more global projects could be slower than on smaller, more regional projects for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract, as well as an increased time frame for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals.\nOur backlog at December 31, 2014 was $1.6 billion. Although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues over time, an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during any particular period, or at all. The extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, delivery against project schedules, scope changes, contract terminations and the nature, duration and complexity of the contracts, and can vary significantly over time.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated between fiscal quarters and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in previous quarters and years and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by a variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022\ntiming of contract amendments for changes in scope that could affect the value of a contract and potentially impact the amount of net new business awards and net service revenues from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022\ncommencement, completion, execution, postponement or termination of large contracts;\n\u2022\ncontract terms for the recognition of revenue milestones;\n\u2022\nprogress of ongoing contracts and retention of customers;\n\u2022\ntiming of and charges associated with completion of acquisitions and other events;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of services delivered, both in terms of geography and type of services;\n\u2022\npotential customer disputes, penalties or other issues that may impact the revenue we are able to recognize or the collectability of our related accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\nexchange rate fluctuations.\nOur operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares.\nWe have a history of net losses which may continue and which may negatively impact our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of net losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we incurred net losses of $23.5 million, $41.5 million and $59.1 million, respectively. If we cannot reach profitability, the value of our stock price may be impacted.\nIf we underprice our contracts, overrun our cost estimates or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in documentation of change orders, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe price our contracts based on assumptions regarding the scope of work required and cost to complete the work. We bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and financial performance. In addition, contracts with our customers are subject to change orders, which occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated in our contract with the customers. This can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key study assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. We may be unable to successfully negotiate changes in scope or change orders on a timely basis or at all, which could require us to incur cost outlays ahead of the receipt of any additional revenue. In addition, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, we cannot recognize additional revenue anticipated from change orders until appropriate documentation is received by us from the customer authorizing the change. However, if we incur additional expense in anticipation of receipt of that documentation, we must recognize the expense as incurred. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems, including the information systems we use to provide services to our customers and to store employee data, and failures of these systems, including cyber-attacks, may materially limit our operations or have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nOur information systems are comprised of systems we have purchased or developed, legacy information systems from organizations we have acquired and, increasingly, web-enabled and other integrated information systems. In using these information systems, we frequently rely on third-party vendors to provide hosting services, where our infrastructure is dependent upon the reliability of their underlying platforms, facilities and communications systems. We also utilize integrated information systems that we provide customers access to or install for our customers in conjunction with our delivery of services.\nAs the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow, we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in maintaining the stability of our legacy systems due to prior customization, attrition of employees or vendors involved in their development, and obsolescence of the underlying technology as well as risks from the increasing number and scope of external data breaches on multi-national companies. Because certain customers and clinical trials may be dependent upon these legacy systems, we also face an increased level of embedded risk in maintaining the legacy systems and limited options to mitigate such risk. We are also exposed to risks associated with the availability of all our information systems, including:\n\u2022\ndisruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms, including those maintained by our third-party vendors;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of, cyber-attacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our internal systems, including our employee data and communications, critical application systems or their associated hardware; and\n\u2022\nexcessive costs, excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment.\nThe materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data, the delivery of databases and services, and the day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or other data. While we have disaster recovery plans in place, they might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities or those of our third-party vendors could result in interruptions in the flow of data to us and from us to our customers. Corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a trial at no cost to the customer, but at significant cost to us, the termination of a contract or damage to our reputation. Additionally, significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, and cyber-attacks such as those recently faced by other multi-national companies could adversely affect our businesses. As our business continues to expand globally, these types of risks may be further increased by instability in the geopolitical climate of certain regions, underdeveloped and less stable utilities and communications infrastructure, and other local and regional factors. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance which we believe is customary for our industry, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, whether through systems failure or employee negligence, cyber-attacks, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, we have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we internally or externally develop for our customers, including a cyber-attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. To date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. Nonetheless, successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nOur customer or therapeutic area concentration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our top ten customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 49% of our net service revenue and our top ten customers based on backlog accounted for approximately 54% of our total backlog. Various subsidiaries of Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. accounted for approximately 14%, 15% and 12% of our net service revenue in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Various subsidiaries of Astellas Pharma, Inc. accounted for 12% of net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. It is possible that an even greater portion of our revenues will be attributable to a smaller number of customers in the future, including as a result of our entering into strategic provider relationships with customers. Also, consolidation in our potential customer base results in increased competition for important market segments and fewer available customer accounts.\nAdditionally, conducting multiple clinical trials for different sponsors in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action may adversely affect our business if some or all of the trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class. Similarly, marketing and selling products for different sponsors with similar drug action subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the products as a class, leading to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of the products from the market.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe have operations in many foreign countries, including, but not limited to, countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 56% of our workforce was located outside of the United States, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 30% of our net service revenue was billed to locations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in operating in these regions, including:\n\u2022\nconducting a single trial across multiple countries is complex, and issues in one country, such as a failure to comply with or unanticipated changes to local regulations or restrictions such as restrictions on import or export of clinical trial material or availability of clinical trial data may affect the progress of the trial in the other countries, resulting in delays or potential termination of contracts, which in turn may result in loss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe United States or other countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies, data protection regulations or economic sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nforeign countries are expanding or may expand their banking regulations that govern international currency transactions, particularly cross-border transfers, which may inhibit our ability to transfer funds into or within a jurisdiction, impeding our ability to pay our principal investigators, vendors and employees, thereby impacting our ability to conduct trials in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nforeign countries are expanding or may expand their regulatory framework with respect to patient informed consent, protection and compensation in clinical trials, additional transparency reporting requirements (similar to the Physician Payment Sunshine Act in the United States), which could delay, inhibit or prohibit our ability to conduct trials in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory or judicial authorities of foreign countries might not enforce legal rights and recognize business procedures in a manner in which we are accustomed or would reasonably expect;\n\u2022\nchanges in political and economic conditions, including inflation, may lead to changes in the business environment in which we operate, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotential violations of existing or newly adopted local laws or anti-bribery laws, such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation;\n\u2022\ncustomers in foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles, and it may be more difficult to collect receivables in those jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, pandemics or international conflict, including terrorist acts, could interrupt our services, endanger our personnel or cause project delays or loss of trial materials or results;\n\u2022\npolitical unrest, such as the current situation in the Ukraine, could delay or disrupt the ability to conduct clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nforeign governments may enact currency exchange controls that may limit the ability to fund our operations or significantly increase the cost of maintaining operations.\nThese risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to, among other things, perform large, global projects for our customers. Furthermore, our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable U.S. laws. Any such risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nGovernmental authorities may question our intercompany transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\nAs a U.S. company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries, we are subject to foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between the parent and subsidiaries. Regulators in the United States and in foreign markets closely monitor our corporate structure and how we account for intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing mechanisms or intercompany transfers, our operations may be negatively impacted and our effective tax rate may increase. Tax rates vary from country to country and if regulators determine that our profits in one jurisdiction should be increased, we might not be able to fully utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated, which would increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, has issued certain proposed guidelines regarding base erosion and profit sharing. Once these guidelines are formally adopted by the OECD, it is possible that separate taxing jurisdictions may also adopt some form of these guidelines. In such case, we may need to change our approach to intercompany transfer pricing in order to maintain compliance under the new rules. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease depending on the current location of global operations at the time of the change. Finally, we might not always be in compliance with all applicable customs, exchange control, Value Added Tax and transfer pricing laws despite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws. If these laws change we may need to adjust our operating procedures and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully increase our market share, our ability to grow our business and execute our growth strategies could be materially adversely affected.\nA key element of our growth strategy is increasing our market share both within the clinical development market and in the geographic markets in which we operate. As we grow our market share, we might not have or adequately build the competencies necessary to perform our services satisfactorily or may face increased competition. If we are unable to succeed in increasing our market share, we will be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nUpgrading the information systems that support our operating processes and evolving the technology platform for our services pose risks to our business.\nContinued efficient operation of our business requires that we implement standardized global business processes and evolve our information systems to enable this implementation. We have continued to undertake significant programs to optimize business processes with respect to our services. Our inability to effectively manage the implementation of new information systems or upgrades and adapt to new processes designed into these new or upgraded systems in a timely and cost-effective manner may result in disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development, integration and hosting services that develop or license to us the information technology, or IT, platforms and capacity for programs to optimize our business processes. If such vendors or their products fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing, implementing and updating our IT platforms, our customer delivery may be impaired, and we may have to make substantial further investments, internally or with third parties, to achieve our objectives. For example, we rely on an external vendor to provide the clinical trial management software used in managing the completion of our customer clinical trials. If that externally provided system is not properly maintained we might not be able to meet the obligations of our contracts or may need to incur significant costs to replace the system or capability. Additionally, our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us.\nMeeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which might not take place as we anticipate, including obtaining adequate technology-enabled services, depending upon our third-party vendors to develop and enhance existing applications to adequately support our business, creating IT-enabled services that our customers will find desirable and implementing our business model with respect to these services. Also, increased IT-related expenditures and our potential inability to anticipate increases in service costs may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in bringing new drugs to market. Our services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, EDC, patient recruitment and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. For example, we must adhere to applicable regulatory requirements such as the FDA, current GCP regulations, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against us or our customers. Such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or failure of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products, imposition of clinical holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, rejection of data collected in our studies, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions, damages or fines. Additionally, there is a risk that actions by regulatory authorities, if they result in significant inspectional observations or other measures, could harm our reputation and cause customers not to award us future contracts or to cancel existing contracts. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nSuch consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur:\nImproper performance of our services. The performance of clinical development services is complex and time-consuming. For example, we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the trial or cause the results of the trial to be reported improperly. If the trial results are compromised, we could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services and our reputation could be harmed. For example:\n\u2022\nnon-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncompromise of data from a particular trial, such as failure to verify that adequate informed consent was obtained from subjects or improper monitoring of data, could require us to repeat the trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us; and\n\u2022\nbreach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract.\nLarge clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and improper performance of our services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, damage our reputation and result in the termination of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.\nInteractive Voice/Web Response Technology malfunction. We develop, maintain and use third-party computer run interactive voice/web response systems to automatically manage the randomization of patients in a given clinical trial to different treatment arms and regulate the supply of investigational drugs, all by means of interactive voice/web response systems. An error in the design, programming or validation of these systems could lead to inappropriate assignment or dosing of patients which could give rise to patient safety issues, invalidation of the trial or liability claims against us. Furthermore, negative publicity associated with such a malfunction could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. Additionally, errors in randomization may require us to repeat the trial at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us.\nInvestigation of customers. From time to time, one or more of our customers are audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs. In these situations, we have often provided services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials, programs or activities being audited or investigated, and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies. There is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them, we could be subject to damages, fines or penalties. In addition, negative\npublicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers' clinical trials, programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nInsufficient customer funding to complete a clinical trial. As noted above, clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial for a customer, and then the customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the trial. In such a situation, notwithstanding the customer's ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the trial, we may be ethically bound to complete or wind down the trial at our own expense.\nIn addition to the above U.S. laws and regulations, we must comply with the laws of all countries where we do business, including laws governing clinical trials in the jurisdiction where the trials are performed. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to regulatory risk, liability and potential costs associated with redoing the trials, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe may become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to governmental or regulatory enforcement activity. While we do not believe that the resolution of any currently pending lawsuits against us will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, litigation to which we subsequently become a party might result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all of the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In particular, any claim could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with our customers, our customers do not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability for personal injury or claims that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nOur business involves clinical trial management, which is one of our clinical development service offerings and includes the testing of new drugs on human volunteers. This business exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from, among other things, possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of a drug or device. Many of these volunteers and patients are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death. Although we attempt to negotiate indemnification arrangements with our customers or vendors, we might not be able to collect under these arrangements and our exposure could exceed any contractual limits on indemnification. Any claim or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nIf our insurance does not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our operations, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and our ordinary indemnification obligations which we believe to be customary for our industry. The coverage provided by such insurance might not be adequate for all claims we may make or may be contested by our insurance carriers. If our insurance is not adequate or available to pay all claims or exposures associated with our operations, or if we are unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract suitable principal investigators and recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials, our clinical development business might suffer.\nThe recruitment of principal investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our business. Principal investigators are typically located at hospitals, clinics or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial. Patients generally include people from the\ncommunities in which the clinical trials are conducted. Our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing principal investigators or recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis. The expanding global nature of clinical trials increases the risk associated with attracting suitable principal investigators and patients, especially if these trials are conducted in regions where our resources or experience may be more limited. For example, if we are unable to engage principal investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials, we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to more principal investigators and patients than planned or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans, which may result in additional costs to us or cancellation of the trial by our customer. If realized, these risks may also inhibit our ability to attract new business, particularly in certain regions.\nMany of the costs for our Phase I Services segment are fixed in nature, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince a large amount of the operating costs for our Phase I Services segment are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation, moderate variations in the commencement, progress or completion of the Phase I studies in our Phase I Services segment may cause variations in our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Expenses must be recognized when incurred and the delay of a contract could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability. Net service revenue from our Phase I Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2014 represented approximately 1% of our total net service revenue for that period.\nIf we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit experienced personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success substantially depends on the collective performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team and other key personnel including qualified management, professional, scientific and technical operating staff and business development personnel. There is significant competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with higher educational degrees, in the biopharmaceutical and related services industries. In addition, the close proximity of some of our facilities to offices of our major competitors could adversely impact our ability to successfully recruit and retain key personnel. The departure of any key executive, or our inability to continue to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion, might impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and might negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nExchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nApproximately 28% of our fiscal year 2014 net service revenues were contracted in currencies other than U.S. dollars and 39% of our direct and operating costs are incurred in countries with functional currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the U.S. dollar create risk in several ways, including:\nForeign Currency Risk from Differences in Customer Contract Currency and Operating Costs Currency. The majority of our global contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars or Euros while the currency used to fund our operating costs in foreign countries is denominated in various different currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies we use to contract with our customers and the currencies in which we incur cost to complete those contracts can have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Translation Risk. The revenue and expenses of our international operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the translation of international results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated results.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk. We are subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of a transaction. We earn revenue from our service contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars over a period\nof several months and, in many cases, over several years. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts.\nWe may limit these risks through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts, or we may hedge our transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts or options. We have not, however, mitigated all of our foreign currency transaction risk, and we may experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the United States and foreign currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including disruptions in the credit and capital markets, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, our customers might not be able to raise money to conduct existing clinical trials, or to fund new drug development and related future clinical trials. In addition, economic or market disruptions could negatively impact our vendors, contractors, or principal investigators which might have a negative effect on our business.\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur effective income tax rate is influenced by our projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we have a full valuation allowance on our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets in the United States, one of our principal contracting locations. Accordingly, under GAAP, we do not recognize a tax benefit or expense in current operations for income generated in this jurisdiction. Factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe requirement to exclude from our quarterly worldwide effective income tax calculations the benefit for losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can be recognized;\n\u2022\nactual and projected full year pre-tax income;\n\u2022\nthe repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States;\n\u2022\nuncertain tax positions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws in various taxing jurisdictions;\n\u2022\naudits by taxing authorities;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized;\n\u2022\nthe release of a previously established valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will be realized; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative mix and size of clinical studies in various tax jurisdictions.\nThese changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $185.1 million and state NOL carryforwards of $263.2 million, which may be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 and will completely expire in 2033. Our state NOL carryforwards may be used over various periods ranging from one to 20 years. See Note 10 \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our tax loss carryovers and current limitations on our ability to utilize NOLs.\nFuture ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Code may subject our tax loss carryforwards to annual limitations which would restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership changes. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our equity at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a specified tax-exempt interest rate.\nWe have had significant financial losses in previous years and, as a result, we currently maintain a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets including our U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and these rights are important to our success.\nWe develop, use and protect our proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements, and copyright and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements might not be fully enforceable, which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Our intellectual property rights might not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours or alleging infringement by us of their intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions. The steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property or claims against us for alleged infringement or misappropriation by competitors, former employees or other third parties. Furthermore, we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate potential future acquisitions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have completed a number of acquisitions in the past and anticipate that a portion of our future growth may come from strategic tuck-in acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend upon, among other things, our ability to effectively integrate acquired personnel, operations, products and technologies into our business and to retain the key personnel and customers of our acquired businesses. In addition, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially acceptable terms. We may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction. Any acquisition could involve other risks, including, among others, the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits, issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interest-bearing debt, loss of key employees of the acquired companies, transaction expenses, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and, with respect to the acquisition of international companies, the inability to overcome differences in international business practices, language and customs. Our failure to successfully integrate potential future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential future investments in our customers' businesses or drugs could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nAlthough we historically have not engaged in business transactions with our customers other than to provide our services, we may in the future enter into arrangements with our customers or other drug companies in which we take on some of the risk of the potential success or failure of their businesses or drugs, including making strategic investments in our customers or other drug companies, providing financing to customers or other drug companies or acquiring an interest in the revenues from customers' drugs or in entities developing a limited number of drugs. Our financial results would be adversely affected if any such investments or the underlying drugs result in losses or do not achieve the level of success that we anticipate and/or our return or payment from any such drug investment or financing is less than our direct and indirect costs with respect to these arrangements.\nOur relationships with existing or potential customers who are in competition with each other may adversely impact the degree to which other customers or potential customers use our services, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to persuade payers, providers and patients that their drug therapies are better and more cost-effective than competing therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms. In addition to the adverse competitive interests that biopharmaceutical companies have with each other, biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry, including payers and providers. Biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies. We regularly provide services to biopharmaceutical companies who compete with each other, and we sometimes provide services to such customers regarding competing drugs in development. Our existing or future relationships, particularly broader strategic provider relationships, with our biopharmaceutical customers may therefore deter other biopharmaceutical customers from using our services or may result in our customers seeking to place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants. In addition, our further expansion into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical customers, and such customers may elect not to use our services, reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to place restrictions on our ability to serve customers in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to theirs. Any loss of customers or reductions in the level of revenues from a customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $747.2 million, which constituted approximately 60% of our total assets. We periodically (at least annually unless triggering events occur that cause an interim evaluation) evaluate goodwill and other acquired intangible assets for impairment. Any future determination requiring the write off of a portion of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are not able to realize the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of $8.0 million and goodwill of $9.2 million associated with our Phase I Services and Global Consulting reporting units. Such impairment charges in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nFrom time to time, we have adopted cost savings initiatives to improve our operating efficiency through various means such as reduction of overcapacity, primarily in our costs of services (billable) function, or other realignment of resources. For example, in the second quarter of 2014, we initiated restructuring activities related to the closure of our Glasgow facility and partial closure of our Cincinnati facility. The plan was substantially completed by December 31, 2014. In March 2013, we adopted a plan to better align headcount and costs with current geographic sources and mix of revenue. The plan was completed by December 31, 2013 and involved the elimination of approximately 325 employee and contract positions. As a result of these restructuring activities, we incurred significant one-time costs, which consist primarily of severance, retention bonuses, professional fees, IT costs, facility closure costs, legal expenses and various other costs. Similarly, in March 2012, in addition to synergies directly related to our acquisition of Kendle, we initiated a restructuring plan to align headcount with our existing book of business that led to a reduction in global headcount of approximately 250 employees. In order to realize the synergies related to our acquisition of Kendle and the cost savings from these additional staff realignment initiatives, we incurred significant one-time costs, which consist primarily of severance, retention bonuses, professional fees, IT transition costs, facility closure costs, legal expenses and various other costs. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we incurred total pre-tax charges of $6.2 million, $11.8 million and $35.4 million, respectively, associated with our restructuring initiatives. Restructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, a greater number of employment claims, the failure to achieve targeted cost savings and the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements\ndue to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur, which, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, UK Bribery Act of 2010 and/or similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe FCPA, UK Bribery Act of 2010 and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, anti-corruption laws have appeared to conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts in violation of anti-corruption laws committed by persons associated with us, and our continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase such risk in the future. Violations of the FCPA or other non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, or even allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation. For example, violations of anti-corruption laws can result in restatements of, or irregularities in, our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions. In some cases, companies that violate the FCPA might be debarred by the U.S. government and/or lose their U.S. export privileges. In addition, U.S. or other governments might seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations or violations of other anti-corruption laws committed by companies that we acquire or in which we invest. Changes in anti-corruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure of third parties to provide us critical support services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe depend on third parties for support services vital to our business. Such support services include, but are not limited to, laboratory services, third-party transportation and travel providers, freight forwarders and customs brokers, drug depots and distribution centers, suppliers or contract manufacturers of drugs for patients participating in clinical trials, and providers of licensing agreements, maintenance contracts or other services. In addition, we also rely on third-party CROs and other contract clinical personnel for clinical services either in regions where we have limited resources, or in cases where demand cannot be met by our internal staff. The failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide us critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nThe operation of our Phase I clinical facility and the services we provide there including direct interaction with clinical trial patients or volunteers could create potential liability that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation.\nWe operate one facility where Phase I clinical trials are conducted. Phase I clinical trials ordinarily involve testing an investigational drug on a limited number of healthy individuals, typically 20 to 120 persons, to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range and identify side effects. Some of these trials involve the administration of investigational drugs to known substance abusers. Failure to operate such a facility in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation. Additionally, we face risks resulting from the administration of drugs to volunteers, including adverse events, and the professional malpractice of medical care providers. We also directly employ nurses and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing involved in our clinical trials, such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers. Any professional malpractice or negligence by such principal investigators, nurses or other employees could potentially result in liability to us in the event of personal injury to or death of a volunteer in clinical trials. This liability, particularly if it were to exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have, may adversely affect our business and financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe face intense competition in many areas of our business and, if we do not compete effectively, our business may be harmed.\nThe CRO industry is highly competitive. We often compete for business with other CROs and internal development departments, some of which could be considered large CROs in their own right. We also compete with universities and teaching hospitals. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources and a wider range of service offerings over a greater geographic area than we do. If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. The industry is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of full-service companies with global capabilities similar to ours. Increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition, such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms, which could adversely affect our operating results. In recent years our industry has experienced consolidation and a number of \"going private\" transactions. This trend is likely to produce more competition from the resulting larger companies, and ones without the cost pressures of being public, for both customers and acquisition candidates. In addition, there are few barriers to entry for smaller specialized companies considering entering the industry. Because of their size and focus, small CROs might compete effectively against larger companies such as us, especially in lower cost geographic areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOutsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and research and development budgets could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate.\nOur revenues depend on the level of R&D expenditures, size of the drug-development pipelines and outsourcing trends of the biopharmaceutical industry, including the amount of such R&D spend that is outsourced and subject to competitive bidding among CROs. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our business. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek long-term strategic collaborations with global CROs, such as the one we recently announced with Allergan. Competition for these collaborations is intense and we might not be selected, in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer, if any, may be limited. Our success depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain preferred provider relationships with large biopharmaceutical companies. Our failure to develop or maintain these preferred provider relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, in order to obtain preferred provider relationships, we may have to reduce the prices for our services, which could negatively impact our gross margin for these services.\nIn addition, if the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry, which may slow decision making by our customers, result in the delay or cancellation of existing projects, cause reductions in overall R&D expenditures, or lead to increased pricing pressures. Further, in the event that one of our customers combines with a company that is using the services of one of our competitors, the combined company could decide to use the services of that competitor or another provider. All of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not order healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws of both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and the\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms which may adversely impact the biopharmaceutical industry and reduce the need for our services or negatively impact our profitability.\nNumerous government bodies are considering or have adopted healthcare reforms and may undertake, or are in the process of undertaking, efforts to control healthcare costs through legislation, regulation and agreements with healthcare providers and biopharmaceutical companies, including many of our customers. By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Among other things, this law imposes cost-containment measures intended to reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhances remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, adds new requirements for biopharmaceutical companies to disclose payments to physicians, including principal investigators, imposes new taxes and fees on biopharmaceutical manufacturers and imposes additional health policy reforms. We are uncertain as to the full effect of these reforms on our business at this time and are unable to predict what legislative proposals, if any, will be adopted in the future. If regulatory cost-containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs by, for example, continuing to place downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and/or increasing regulatory burdens and operating costs of the biopharmaceutical industry, our customers may reduce their R&D spending, which could reduce the business they outsource to us. Similarly, if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted, the demand for our services could decrease.\nIn addition, government bodies have adopted and may continue to adopt new healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations. For example, product safety concerns and recommendations by the Drug Safety Oversight Board could change the regulatory environment for drug products, and new or heightened regulatory requirements may increase our expenses or limit our ability to offer some of our services. We might have to incur additional costs to comply with these or other new regulations, and failure to comply could harm our financial condition, results or operations, cash flows, and reputation. Additionally, new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct industry-sponsored clinical trials, which could reduce the need for our post-approval development services.\nCurrent and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings.\nThe confidentiality, collection, use and disclosure of personal data, including clinical trial patient-specific information, are subject to governmental regulation generally in the country in which the personal data was collected or used. For example, U.S. federal regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by HIPAA, generally require individuals' written authorization, in addition to any required informed consent, before protected health information, or PHI, may be used for research and such regulations specify standards for de-identifications and for limited data sets. We may also be subject to applicable state privacy and security laws and regulations in states in which we operate. We are indirectly affected by the privacy provisions surrounding individual authorizations because many principal investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are directly subject to them as a HIPAA \"covered entity.\" In addition, we obtain identifiable health information from third parties that are subject to such regulations. While we do not believe we are a \"business associate\" under HIPAA, regulatory agencies may disagree. Because of amendments to the HIPAA data security and privacy rules that were promulgated on January 25, 2013, some of which went into effect on March 26, 2013, there are some instances where HIPAA \"business associates\" of a \"covered entity\" may be directly liable for breaches of PHI and other HIPAA violations. These amendments may subject \"business associates\" to HIPAA's enforcement scheme, which, as amended, can yield up to $1.5 million in annual civil penalties for each HIPAA violation.\nIn the EU, personal data includes any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person with health information carrying additional obligations, including obtaining the explicit consent from the individual for collection, use or disclosure of the information. In addition, we are subject to EU rules with respect to cross-border transfers of such data out of the EU. The United States, the EU and its member states, and other countries where we have operations, such as Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Singapore, continue to issue new privacy and data protection rules and regulations\nthat relate to personal data and health information. Failure to comply with certain certification/registration and annual re-certification/registration provisions associated with these data protection and privacy regulations and rules in various jurisdictions, or to resolve any serious privacy or security complaints, could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution or civil liability. Federal, state and foreign governments may propose or have adopted additional legislation governing the collection, possession, use or dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information, and personal financial data as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation de-identified health or other personal data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services. Additionally, if we violate applicable laws, regulations or duties relating to the use, privacy or security of personal data, we could be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution, be forced to alter our business practices and suffer reputational harm. In the next few years, the European data protection framework may be revised as a generally applicable data regulation. The text has not yet been finalized, but it contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, sanctions of up to 2% of worldwide gross revenue and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the proposed regulation.\nActions by regulatory authorities or customers to limit the scope of or withdraw an approved drug from the market could result in a loss of revenue.\nGovernment regulators have the authority, after approving a drug or device, to limit its indication for use by requiring additional labeled warnings or to withdraw the drug or device's approval for its approved indication based on safety concerns. Similarly, customers may act to voluntarily limit the availability of approved drugs or devices or withdraw them from the market after we begin our work. If we are providing services to customers for drugs or devices that are limited or withdrawn, we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such drugs or devices, which would prevent us from earning the full amount of service revenue anticipated under the related service contracts.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological change, our services may become less competitive or obsolete.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry generally, and drug development and clinical research more specifically, are subject to rapid technological change. Our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than, or render obsolete, our current or future technologies and services. If our competitors introduce superior technologies or services and if we cannot make enhancements to remain competitive, our competitive position would be harmed. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose customers or be unable to attract new customers, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIn addition, the operation of our business relies on IT infrastructure and systems delivered across multiple platforms. The failure of our systems to perform could severely disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. Our systems are also vulnerable to demise from natural or man-made disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or hackers, power loss or other technology system failures. These events could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total principal amount of indebtedness, including capital leases, was $425.5 million and we had up to $99.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and thus make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our senior secured facilities. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt and adequately fund our business, we may be required to seek further additional financing or refinancing or dispose of assets. We might not be able to influence any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. Our substantial indebtedness could also:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a more substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make required payments under our existing contractual commitments, including our existing long-term indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund a change of control offer;\n\u2022\nrequire us to sell certain assets;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic investments, including acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\ncause us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancings;\n\u2022\nincrease our exposure to rising interest rates because a substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable interest rates; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow on terms that are satisfactory to us.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations. Incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although covenants under our Credit Agreement limit our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt obligations, would increase.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt, make strategic acquisitions and to fund capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, our ability to generate future cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\nour business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;\n\u2022\nwe will continue to realize the cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements that resulted from the execution of our long-term strategic plan; or\n\u2022\nfuture sources of funding will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs.\nWe also may experience difficulties repatriating cash from foreign subsidiaries and accounts due to law, regulation or contracts which could further constrain our liquidity. If we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, marketing efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable or favorable terms, or at all, or that they would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt or generate enough cash flow to fund our liquidity needs, could intensify.\nCovenant restrictions under our Credit Agreement may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur Credit Agreement contains covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, borrow money, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions and effect a consolidation, merger or disposal of all or substantially all of our assets. Although the covenants in our Credit Agreement are subject to various exceptions, we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest. In addition, in certain circumstances, our long-term debt requires us to maintain a specified financial ratio and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured facilities. If an event of default under our Credit Agreement occurs, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In such case, we might not have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts. In addition, our Credit Agreement is secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property, including the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries. If an event of default under our Credit Agreement occurs, the lenders thereunder could exercise their rights under the related security documents. Any acceleration of amounts due under our Credit Agreement or the substantial exercise by the lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nInterest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause we have substantial variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2014 we had $425.0 million of total indebtedness with variable interest rates that only vary to the extent LIBOR exceeds one percent.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price might fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of your investment in our common stock to decline.\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations. The public market for our common stock is very new, and its trading price is likely to be volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry, including with respect to the regulatory environment, or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in quarterly operating results, as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new service offerings or significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nactions by competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies;\n\u2022\ninvestors' perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the industry;\n\u2022\nthe public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements related to litigation;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet those estimates or the failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit ratings of our debt;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, security holders have often instituted class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management's attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our Credit Agreement and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Consequently, you should not rely on dividends in order to receive a return on your investment.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. The perception that such sales could occur could also depress the market price of our common stock. Any such sales could also create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and might also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 51,199,856 outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 10,033,994 outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, of which:\n\u2022\n9,324,324 shares are shares that we sold in our initial public offering on November 7, 2014, and, unless purchased by affiliates, may be resold in the public market;\n\u2022\n51,909,526 shares are \"restricted securities,\" as defined under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and are eligible for sale in the public market subject to the requirements of Rule 144; of these, 51,331,397 shares are subject to lock-up agreements and will become available for resale in the public market beginning on May 5, 2015; and\n\u2022\n3,930,894 shares are shares of outstanding options and restricted stock units that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale subject in some cases to Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act.\nOur Sponsors effectively control our company, and their interests may be different from or conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nThe Sponsors collectively own approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock. As a consequence, the Sponsors are able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and will control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant transaction. Additionally, the Sponsors are parties to a stockholders agreement, or the Stockholders Agreement. The Stockholders Agreement, among other things, imposes certain transfer restrictions on the shares held by such stockholders and requires such stockholders to vote in favor of certain nominees to our Board of Directors. The interests of the Sponsors might not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For instance, this concentration of ownership and/or the restrictions imposed by the Stockholders Agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price.\nThe Sponsors each make investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue, for their own accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities might not be available to us. Our organizational documents contain provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy held by our directors affiliated with the Sponsors in certain corporate opportunities. Accordingly, the interests of the Sponsors may supersede ours, causing the Sponsors or their affiliates to compete against us or to pursue opportunities instead of us, for which we have no recourse. Such actions on the part of the Sponsors and inaction on our part could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Sponsors control four seats on our Board of Directors. Since the Sponsors could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, when conflicts arise between the interests of the Sponsors and the interests of our stockholders, these directors may not be disinterested.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, we rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nThe Sponsors control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ Global Select Market, or the NASDAQ. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities, or otherwise have director nominees selected by vote of a majority of the independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.\nBecause we utilize these exemptions we do not have a majority of independent directors, our nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee do not consist entirely of independent directors and are not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ.\nThe Sponsors are not subject to any contractual obligation to retain their controlling interest, except that they have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock or other capital stock or other securities exercisable or convertible therefor until May 5, 2015, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the underwriters of our previously completed initial public offering. After May 5, 2015, there can be no assurance as to the period of time during which the Sponsors will maintain their ownership of our common stock. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the period of time during which we will be able to avail ourselves of the controlled company exemptions.\nProvisions of our corporate governance documents and Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that delay, defer or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include, (1) our ability to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, (2) the requirement that our stockholders may not act without a meeting, (3) requirements for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals contained in our bylaws, (4) the absence of cumulative voting for our directors, (5) requirements for stockholder approval of certain business combinations and (6) the limitations on director nominations contained in our Stockholders Agreement.\nAdditionally, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of the foregoing provision could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock.\nWe will incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a new public company, we are required to comply with certain additional corporate governance and financial reporting practices and policies required of a publicly traded company. As a result, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a privately held company, due to compliance requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or the NASDAQ, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results with the SEC. We are also required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. We expect to incur additional\nannual expenses of $3.0 million to $5.0 million related to these increased requirements, including additional directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, director fees, transfer agent fees, accounting, legal and administrative personnel expenses, and increased auditing and legal fees. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and might make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources.\nAs a public company, we will be required to, among other things:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and applicable NASDAQ rules;\n\u2022\ncreate or expand the roles and duties of our board of directors, or our Board, and committees of the Board;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.\nThese changes will require a significant commitment of additional resources. We might not be successful in complying with these obligations and the significant commitment of resources required for complying with them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur internal control over financial reporting does not currently meet all the standards of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting when required could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC as a public company. Because we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis beginning with our second annual report. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation of our existing controls and could result in incurring significant additional expenditures.\nWe are in the process of designing, implementing, and testing the internal control over our financial reporting in order to comply with this obligation. The process necessary to meet these requirements is time consuming, costly, and complicated. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that cause us to incur significant costs and cause distractions from our business objectives and for which we might not be able to remediate deficiencies in time to meet the deadlines imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any required improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Further, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may exist or otherwise be discovered in the future. If we are not able to meet the compliance requirements of the applicable provisions of Section 404, we will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement. In addition, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely, result in misstatements and restatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence and have a material adverse effect on our stock price, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in our Credit Agreement and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries might not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or other obligations. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares, publish negative research or reports, or do not publish reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is to some extent influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors' stock, our share price might decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we might lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15071, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "SYNH"}
