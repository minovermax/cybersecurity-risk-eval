{"cik": "1538217", "company": "SRAX, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nPlease consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Although we have organized the risk factors below under headings to make them easier to read, many of the risks we face involve more than one type of risk. Consequently, you should read all of the risk factors below carefully before making any decision to acquire or hold our securities.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in the foreseeable future.\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2020 we reported losses from operations and an accumulated deficit of $11,597,000 and $50,342,000, respectively. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to grow our revenues, contain our operating expenses and generate profits. We do not have any long-term agreements with our customers. There are no assurances that we will be able to increase our revenues and cash flow to a level which supports profitable operations. We may continue to incur losses in future periods until such time, if ever, as we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues and cash flow beyond what is necessary to fund our ongoing operations and pay our obligations as they become due. If we are able to significantly increase our revenues in future periods, the rapid growth which we are pursuing will strain our organization and we may encounter difficulties in maintaining the quality of our operations. If we are not able to grow successfully, it is unlikely we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to pay our operating expenses and service our debt obligations or report profitable operations in future periods.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities or advisors could adversely impact our business.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or other public health crisis were to affect our operations, facilities or those of our customers or suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only materially impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors\u2019 report on our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements expresses an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their audit report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. Based upon our cash position on December 31, 2020, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern past the third quarter of 2021. Our ability to continue as a going concern is based on several factors; (i) our ability to sustain our current operating performance, and (ii) our ability to raise additional capital. If we are not successful with either of these, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and may cease operation or seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to pay our indebtedness as it comes due.\nIn June 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors for the issuance of approximately $16.1 million in principal of debentures. Pursuant to the terms of the debentures (subject to three (3) separate deferrals of six (6) months each in exchange for increased principal added to the Debentures), we will be required to begin making amortization payments on the debentures beginning on December 31, 2020. Payment of the debentures is secured by substantially all the assets and the intellectual property of the Company. Although we have recently achieved profitability, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the debentures as they come due. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the debentures was approximately 9,386,000. Although a number of debentures have been converted, as of March 28, 2021, the outstanding balance of debentures is $3,800,000. If we are not able to generate enough cashflow through the operation of our business, we will need to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity or the sale of assets, in order to make the required amortization payments. If we are unable to make the required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements and covenants of the debentures, we would be in default, which would permit the holders of the debentures to accelerate the maturity and require immediate repayment and lead to potential foreclosure on the assets securing the debt. If we are unable to refinance or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, including upon an event of default, we may become insolvent and be unable to continue operations.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, has resulted in the need for us to restate previously issued financial statements. As a result, current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and value of our stock.\nOr management has determined that, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nNatural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks, trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners, manufacturers, regulators or other third parties with whom we conduct business now or in the future.\nA wide variety of events beyond our control, including natural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks (such as the recent novel coronavirus outbreak), trade wars, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our manufacturers, regulatory authorities, or other third parties with whom we conduct business. These events may cause businesses and government agencies to be shut down, supply chains to be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals to become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. For example, California recently ordered most businesses closed, mandating work-from-home arrangements, where feasible, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These limitations could negatively affect our business operations and continuity, and could negatively impact ability to timely perform basic business functions, including making SEC filings and preparing financial reports. If our operations or those of third parties with whom we have business are impaired or curtailed as a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be impaired or halted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to manage our marketing and advertising expenses, it could materially harm our results of operations and growth.\nWe plan to rely in part on our marketing and advertising efforts to attract new members. Our future growth and profitability, as well as the maintenance and enhancement of our brand, will depend in large part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing and advertising strategies and expenditures. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. In addition, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing and advertising expenses than we currently anticipate if excessive numbers of members withdraw their member data from our Database.\nIf we are unable to satisfy data privacy, protection, security, and other government- and industry-specific requirements, our growth could be harmed.\nWe need or may in the future need to comply with a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. Security compromises could harm our reputation, erode user confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new members, or cause existing users to withdraw their data from BIGToken.\nRegulatory, legislative or self-regulatory developments regarding internet privacy matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nThe United States and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict our ability to collect, process, use, transfer and pool data collected from and about consumers and devices. Trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups have also promulgated best practices and other industry standards relating to targeted advertising. Various U.S. and foreign governments, self-regulatory bodies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulations specifically directed at the digital advertising industry, and we expect to see an increase in legislation, regulation and self-regulation in this area. The legal, regulatory and judicial environment we face around privacy and other matters is constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which was agreed by E.U. institutions in 2016 and came into effect after a two year transition period on May 25, 2018, updated and modernized the principles of the 1995 Data Protection Directive and significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance. Data Protection Authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines of up to a maximum of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the data controller\u2019s or data processor\u2019s total worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year. Similarly, the E-Privacy Regulation, which was launched by the European Parliament in October 2016, could result in, once enacted, new rules and mechanisms for \u201ccookie\u201d consent. In addition, the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. Legislative and regulatory authorities around the world may decide to enact additional legislation or regulations, which could reduce the amount of data we can collect or process and, as a result, significantly impact our business. Similarly, clarifications of and changes to these existing and proposed laws, regulations, judicial interpretations and industry standards can be costly to comply with, and we may be unable to pass along those costs to our clients in the form of increased fees, which may negatively affect our operating results. Such changes can also delay or impede the development of new solutions, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, require significant incremental management time and attention, increase our risk of non-compliance and subject us to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, including our ability to charge per click or the scope of clicks for which we charge. Additionally, any perception of our practices or solutions as an invasion of privacy, whether or not such practices or solutions are consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Finally, our legal and financial exposure often depends in part on our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with visitors\u2019 expectations. We rely on representations made to us by clients that they will comply with all applicable laws, including all relevant privacy and data protection regulations. We make reasonable efforts to enforce such representations and contractual requirements, but we do not fully audit our clients\u2019 compliance with our recommended disclosures or their adherence to privacy laws and regulations. If our clients fail to adhere to our contracts in this regard, or a court or governmental agency determines that we have not adequately, accurately or completely described our own solutions, services and data collection, use and sharing practices in our own disclosures to consumers, then we and our clients may be subject to potentially adverse publicity, damages and related possible investigation or other regulatory activity in connection with our privacy practices or those of our clients.\nUnfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business.\nUnfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms of service, regulatory activity, the actions of third parties, the use of our products or services for illicit, objectionable, or illegal ends or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us, could adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and result in user attrition which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, such as privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and securities law compliance. Expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take, may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nAdditionally, as we allow European users, we are subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective as of May 2018. The GDPR increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government authorities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the newer industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede our international growth, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business.\nSecurity breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users\u2019 data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from or to users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss or misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry. As a result of recent attention and growth of, the size of our user base, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. Our efforts to address undesirable activity may also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. Cyber-attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we are currently in the process of developing systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will ultimately become operational or provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.\nAffected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper disclosure of data, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\nIf we were to lose or have limited access to certain platforms or data sources, we will lose our existing revenue from these platform and sources.\nThe loss of access to any platforms or data sources could limit our ability to effectively grow a portion of our operations. Our business would be harmed if these platforms:\n\u25cf discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other application developers;\n\u25cf modify terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or changes how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers;\n\u25cf establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors; or\n\u25cf develops its own competitive offerings.\nWe have benefited from Facebook\u2019s strong brand recognition and large user base. Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and any changes to those terms of service may be unfavorable to us. Facebook may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook platform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or restrict how Facebook users can share information with friends on their platform. In the event Facebook makes any changes in the future, we may have to modify the structure of our campaigns which could impact the effectiveness of our campaigns and adversely impact our results of operations in future periods.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers and the loss of any of their services could harm our ability to operate our business in future periods.\nOur success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, including Christopher Miglino, Michael Malone, and Christopher Lahiji, the president of our wholly owned subsidiary, LD Micro. We are a party to an employment agreement with each of Mr. Miglino, Mr. Malone and Mr. Lahiji. Although we do not expect to lose their services in the foreseeable future, the loss of any of them could materially harm our business and operations in future periods until such time as we were able to engage a suitable replacement.\nIf advertising on the Internet loses its appeal, our revenue could decline.\nOur business model may not continue to be effective in the future for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf our ability to create applications for our customers;\n\u25cf internet advertisements and promotions are, by their nature, limited in content relative to other media;\n\u25cf companies may prefer other forms of Internet advertising and promotions that we do not offer; and\n\u25cf regulatory actions may negatively impact our business practices.\nWeak economic conditions may reduce consumer demand for products and services.\nA weak economy in the United States could adversely affect demand for advertising products, and services. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from businesses that are highly dependent on discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic instability. Accordingly, the ability of our advertisers to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments remain weak or decline further. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have operations outside of the United States that are subject to numerous operational risks.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have operations in countries other than the United States. In many foreign countries, it is not uncommon to encounter business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. Although certain of our subsidiaries and business affiliates have undertaken compliance efforts with respect to these laws, their respective employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which they outsource certain of their business operations, may take actions in violation of their policies and procedures. Any such violation, even if prohibited by the policies and procedures of these subsidiaries and business affiliates or the law, could have certain adverse effects on the financial condition of these subsidiaries and business affiliates. Any failure by these subsidiaries and business affiliates to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international operation of their businesses could materially adversely affect their, and hence our, financial condition.\nIn the event that we are unable to conduct business with certain third-party providers of data and information integral to our operations, our revenue and business prospects may suffer.\nWe rely on access to certain third-party providers of data in the investment sector in order for Sequire\u2019s platform to function and provide meaningful data and insights for our customers. We have benefited from the data that these third-parties have provided to us on behalf of their customers. In the event that we lose access to these third-party providers, it would limit our ability to effectively market the Sequire platform and sell our services to our customers. In the event that these third-party providers change their terms or our ability to access their data on a cost-effective basis to us, our business may be materially harmed.\nCompetitors may create products that compete with Sequire platform and there can be no assurances that we\u2019ll be able to protect our intellectual property related to Sequire.\nThe Sequire platform\u2019s success depends heavily on our intellectual property and the continued development and innovation of the platform. Notwithstanding, there may be competitors seeking to compete by creating similar platforms with more aggressive pricing or lower cost structures, greater functionality, and by emulating the services provided by the Sequire platform. Furthermore, certain of the information that we implement in our Sequire platform is either publicly available or ascertained through third-party service providers for which no barrier to entry exists. Companies with significantly more resources than us may attempt to create competing products at lower prices. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we are able to adequately defend our trade secrets or intellectual property rights with respect to competitors.\nRisks Related to receipt of Securities for Services\nWe are not, and do not intend to become, regulated as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (and similar legislation in other jurisdictions) and if we are deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions would make it impractical for us to operate as contemplated.\nThe U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder (and similar legislation in other jurisdictions) provide certain protections to investors and impose certain restrictions on companies that are registered as investment companies. Among other things, such rules limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities and impose certain governance requirements. We have not been and do not intend to become regulated as an investment company and we intend to conduct its activities so it will not be deemed to be an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (and similar legislation in other jurisdictions). In order to ensure that we are not deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to materially restrict or limit the scope of our operations or plans related to Sequire, we will be limited in the types of acquisitions that we may make and we may need to modify our organizational structure or dispose of assets that we would not otherwise dispose of. Moreover, if anything were to happen which would potentially cause us to be deemed an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, it would be impractical for us to operate as intended pursuant to the Sequire platform and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, we would be required to take extraordinary steps to address the situation, such as the modification and restructuring of our Sequire platform, which would materially adversely affect our ability to derive revenue.\nSequire\u2019s services are primarily paid for in restricted shares of stock of its customers, which are often smaller publicly traded companies with volatile stock prices, limited liquidity, and risker operations.\nThe Sequire platform provides SaaS, and payment is often made through equity securities of customers instead of cash. The securities issued are often those of smaller size public companies that often have limited operating cash and negative cash flows. Additionally, these securities are primarily restricted, and are subject to legal holding periods pursuant to Rule 144. The value of such securities on the date of receipt compared to the date when we are able to legally sell the securities may decrease, and the stock price of such issuers is often volatile, unpredictable and has limited liquidity. As a result, the value of the equity received on the date of payment may be significantly greater than the actual revenue derived by us upon a sale of the securities. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the companies we receive securities from pursuant to our Sequire services will remain solvent during the legally required holding period under Rule 144, which would result in the loss of some or all of our anticipated revenue. As we are not experienced stock traders, there can be no assurances that our personnel responsible for selling the securities will do so at opportune times, or be able to maximize revenue.\nSequire\u2019s receipt of securities in lieu of cash may be affected negatively by a downturn in the U.S. and/or global securities markets and could significantly reduce our revenue.\nGeneral political and economic conditions and events such as U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, economic recession, governmental shutdown, trade tensions and disputes, global economic slowdown, widespread health epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war, changes in local and national economic and political conditions, regulatory changes or changes in the law, or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations could create a downturn in the U.S. and/or global securities markets. As we receive restricted securities of companies, a downturn in the U.S. or global markets may impact such companies and the value of our securities.\nRecently, the spread of COVID-19 has adversely affected global business activities and has resulted in significant uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in financial markets. The impact of the coronavirus continues to evolve and has been marked by rapid changes and developments. Accordingly, we cannot reliably predict the ultimate impact on financial markets and value of our securities held.\nRisks Related to LD Micro\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities or advisors could adversely impact our business.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or other public health crisis were to affect our operations, facilities or those of our customers or suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only materially impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn the event that we are unable to integrate LD Micro, our newly acquired wholly owned subsidiary with our current assets or continue to develop LD Micro, it could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn September 2020, we acquired LD Micro as a wholly owned subsidiary. Management is currently integrating operational aspects of LD Micro into SRAX. There can be no assurances that LD Micro is profitable, that we successfully integrate LD Micro\u2019s business with that of SRAX, or that we are able to successfully operate LD Micro\u2019s operations profitably. The failure to do any of the foregoing could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLD Micro, our newly acquired subsidiary operates in a business segment that has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur recently acquired subsidiary, LD Micro, hosts online and in-person investor conferences for publicly traded companies. While we believe we will be able to transition a majority of the events and conferences into an online format during the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so successfully, or that investors and other attendees will find such virtual conferences as compelling.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock pursuant to our at the market sales agreement.\nWe are a party to an at-the-market sales agreement pursuant to which we are able to sell our Class A common shares directly into the market. Currently, we would be required to use the proceeds to pay for the redemption of our outstanding Debentures, subject to certain amounts as more fully set forth in the Debentures. If we are required to sell a substantial number of shares, or the public perceives that these sales may occur, it could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares in the public market, or the possibility of such sales, could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from sales under our at-the-market sales agreement, and may not use the proceeds effectively.\nAs a result of sales made under our at-the-market sales agreement in excess of those required to be paid pursuant to our outstanding Debentures, our management will have broad discretion in the application of such net proceeds, if any, and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our Class A Common Stock. You will be relying on the judgment of our management concerning these uses and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The failure of our management to apply these funds effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nThe actual number of shares we will issue under the at-the-market sales agreement, at any one time or in total, is uncertain.\nSubject to certain limitations in the at-the-market sales agreement and compliance with applicable law, we and our Sales Agent may mutually agree to sell shares of our Class A Common Stock at any time throughout the term of the ATM. The number of shares that are sold by the Sales Agent after agreement on the terms of the transaction acceptance will fluctuate based on the market price of the shares of our Class A Common Stock during the sales period and limits we set with our Sales Agent. Because the price per share of each share sold will fluctuate based on the market price of our shares of Class A Common Stock during the sales period, it is not possible to predict the number of shares that will ultimately be issued.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile.\nThe market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than those of a seasoned issuer. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. Mainly however, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our limited operating history, lack of significant revenues to date, our continued operating losses and missed guidance. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Additionally, in the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class A common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this quarterly report, these factors include:\n\u25cf the success of competitive products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf sales of our Class A common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u25cf additional issuances of securities upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants;\n\u25cf market conditions in the technology sectors; and\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and advertising technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of the shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of the shares of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. To the extent that any claims or suits are brought against us and successfully concluded, we could be materially adversely affected, jeopardizing our ability to operate successfully. Furthermore, our human and capital resources could be adversely affected by the need to defend any such actions, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense.\nFailure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe have previously provided, and may provide in the future, public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors with a better understanding of management\u2019s expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided. For example, in the past, we have missed guidance a number of times. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline.\nDelaware law contains anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our company and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us, without our board of directors\u2019 consent, for at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. A small number of securities and industry analysts currently publish research regarding our Company on a limited basis. In the event that one or more of the securities or industry analysts who have initiated coverage downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our shares of Class A common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the trading price of our shares of Class A common stock and trading volume to decline.\nThe elimination of monetary liability against our directors and officers under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors and officers may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation eliminates the personal liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent permissible under Delaware law. Further, our bylaws provide that we are obligated to indemnify any of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law. We are also parties to separate indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and our officers which, subject to certain conditions, require us to advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even if such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us or our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16399, "SIC": 7311, "TIC": "SRAX"}
