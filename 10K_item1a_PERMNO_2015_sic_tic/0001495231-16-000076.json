{"cik": "1495231", "company": "IZEA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth at the beginning of Management's Discussion and Analysis entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\", investors should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of losses, expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception which has resulted in a total accumulated deficit of $34,249,521 as of December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a net loss of $11,308,171, including a $7,222,320 loss from operations. Although our revenue has increased since inception, we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain these growth rates or realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe are developing a new platform to process all of our existing business transactions and grow our operations, but cannot provide any assurance regarding its commercial success.\nWe are continuing to develop our primary platform called the IZEA Exchange (IZEAx). IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of content through a wide variety of social channels. IZEAx is a brand-new system, engineered from the ground-up to provide an integrated offering that is improved and more efficient for the company to operate. Our intention is to focus all of our engineering resources on the IZEAx platform for the foreseeable future. Throughout 2016, we will be adding additional features and begin integrating the Ebyline platform offerings for content services within our IZEAx platform. We are spending a significant amount of time and resources on the development of this platform, but we cannot provide any assurances of its short or long-term commercial success or growth. There is no assurance that the amount of money being allocated for the platform will be sufficient to complete it, or that such completion will result in\nsignificant revenues or profit for us. There is a risk that the merging of our Ebyline platform will result in a decrease in revenue related to the self-service content business if the customers do not understand the changes or perceive that the IZEAx platform can provide them with a similar or value added service experience. If our advertisers and creators do not perceive this platform to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to retain them or acquire new advertisers and creators. Additionally, if existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over this platform, demand for IZEAx may decrease and our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nWe have experienced rapid growth over a short period and we do not know whether this will continue to develop or whether it can be maintained. If we are unable to successfully respond to changes in the market, our business could be harmed.\nOur business has grown rapidly as publishers, brands and creators have increasingly used our platforms. It is difficult to predict whether our platforms will continue to grow and whether the historical levels of growth can be maintained. We expect that the platforms will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict. It is possible that brands and creators could broadly determine that they no longer believe in the value of our current platforms. In the event of these or any other changes to the market, our continued success will depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet the changing market dynamics. If we are unable to do so, our business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nDelays in releasing enhanced versions of our products and services could adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs part of our strategy, we expect to periodically release enhanced versions of our premier platforms and related services. Even if our new versions contain the features and functionality our customers want, in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new product releases, our competitive position may be harmed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products in a timely and efficient manner. Due to the complexity of these products, internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre-commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these new versions. In addition, the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products. Any delay in releasing other future products or enhancements of our products could cause our financial results to be adversely impacted.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our acquiring companies, technologies and assets and adding them to our portfolio of software services to drive additional near and long-term revenue, which we may be unable to do.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on our ability to acquire companies, technologies and assets. The success of this acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to accomplish the following:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable companies, technologies or assets to buy;\n\u2022\ncomplete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\ncomplete the acquisition(s) in the time frame and within the budget we expect; and\n\u2022\nimprove the results of operations of each of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate its operations on an accretive basis.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in any or all of the factors above. Our failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could have an adverse effect on other aspects of our business strategy and our business in general. We may not be able to find appropriate acquisition candidates, accretively acquire those candidates that we identify or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably. We currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that we will complete any acquisitions in the future.\nThe social sponsorship landscape is subject to numerous changes that could cause our revenue to decline.\nOur business model may not continue to be effective in the future for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nsocial sponsorship is, by its nature, limited in content relative to other media;\n\u2022\ncompanies may be reluctant or slow to adopt social sponsorship that replaces, limits or competes with their existing direct marketing efforts;\n\u2022\ncompanies may prefer other forms of advertising we do not offer, including certain forms of search engine placements;\n\u2022\ncompanies, such as Facebook and Twitter, may no longer grant us access to their websites in connection with our social sponsorship platforms;\n\u2022\ncompanies may not utilize social sponsorship due to concerns of \u201cclick-fraud\u201d particularly related to search engine placements (\u201cclick-fraud\u201d is a form of online fraud when a person or computer program imitates a legitimate user by\nclicking on an advertisement for the purpose generating a charge per click without having an actual interest in the target of the advertisement's link); and\n\u2022\nregulatory actions may negatively impact certain business practices that we currently rely on to generate a portion of our revenue and profitability.\nIf the number of companies that purchase social sponsorship from us or the size of the sponsorship campaigns does not grow, our revenue could decline which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to retain existing creators, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nWe must continue to retain and acquire creators that publish sponsorships through IZEAx in order to increase revenue from customers and achieve profitability. If creators do not perceive our products and services to be of high value and quality or if we fail to provide value with IZEAx, we may not be able to acquire or retain creators. If we are unable to acquire new creators in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if creators cease using our products and services, the revenue we generate may decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that many of our new creators originate from word of mouth and other referrals from existing creators, and therefore we must ensure that our existing creators remain loyal to our service in order to continue receiving those referrals. If our efforts to satisfy our existing creators are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new creators in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new creators.\nIf we fail to retain existing customers or add new customers, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain brands that are prepared to offer products or services on compelling terms through IZEAx. We must continue to attract and retain brand customers in order to increase revenue and achieve profitability. We have one customer that accounted for 14% of our revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. If new customers do not find our marketing and promotional services effective, or if existing customers do not believe that utilizing our platforms provides them with a long-term increase in value, revenue or profit, they may stop advertising through our platforms. In addition, we may experience attrition in our customers in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including losses to competitors, closures or bankruptcies. If we are unable to attract new customers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if too many customers are unwilling to offer products or services with compelling terms to our creators through our platforms or if too many large customers seek extended payment terms, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIntense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability.\nThe market for native advertising is highly competitive. We expect this competition to continue to increase, in part because there are no significant barriers to entry to our industry. Increased competition may result in price reductions for advertising space, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our principal competitors include other companies that provide advertisers with Internet advertising solutions and companies that offer pay per click search services.\nCompetition for advertising placements among current and future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high traffic websites and social sponsorship providers, as well as competition with other media for native advertising placements, could result in significant price competition, declining margins and reductions in advertising revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of other media companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. We also compete with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, television, radio, cable and print for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we fail to compete successfully, we could lose customers or advertising inventory and our revenue and results of operations could decline.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we receive unfavorable media coverage, our ability to expand our base of creators and advertisers will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the \"IZEA\" brand is critical to expanding our base of creators and advertisers. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain the \"IZEA\" brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our platforms, applications, practices or service offerings, or the offerings of our advertisers, could adversely affect our reputation, resulting in difficulties in recruiting, decreased revenue and a negative impact on the number of advertisers and the size of our creator base, the loyalty of our creators and the number and variety of sponsorships we offer each day. As a result, our business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur total number of user accounts may be higher than the number of our actual individual advertisers or creators and may not be representative of the number of persons who are active users.\nOur total number of user accounts in IZEAx and Ebyline may be higher than the number of our actual individual advertisers and creators because some may have created multiple accounts for different purposes, including different user connections. We define a user connection as a social account or blog that has been added to IZEAx under a user account. It is possible for one user to add as many user connections as they like, and it is common for talent mangers and large publishers to add many connections under a single account. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these creators, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual individual creators, and thus we rely on the number of total user connections and user accounts as our measure of the size of our user base. In addition, the number of user accounts includes the total number of individuals that have completed registration through a specific date, less individuals who have unsubscribed, and should not be considered as representative of the number of persons who continue to actively create to fulfill the sponsorships offered through our platforms. Many users may create an account, but do not actively participate in marketplace activities.\nWe may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.\nAs described in the section \"Business - Government Regulation,\" we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally and certain laws or regulations directly applicable to service providers for advertising and marketing Internet commerce. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the social media, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may become applicable to us or may be adopted in the future with respect to the Internet covering issues such as:\n\u2022\ntruth-in-advertising;\n\u2022\nuser privacy;\n\u2022\ntaxation;\n\u2022\nright to access personal data;\n\u2022\ncopyrights;\n\u2022\ndistribution; and\n\u2022\ncharacteristics and quality of services.\nThe applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property, encryption, taxation, libel, export or import matters and personal privacy to social media platforms is uncertain. The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of social media platforms and related technologies. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of social media and related technologies. Changes to these laws intended to address these issues, including some recently proposed changes, could create uncertainty in the social media marketplace. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs.\nOur social sponsorship business is subject to the risks associated with word of mouth advertising and endorsements, such as violations of the \u201ctruth-in-advertising,\u201d FTC Guides and other similar regulatory requirements and, more generally, loss of consumer confidence.\nWe do not engage in targeted or online behavioral advertising practices, nor do we compile or use information concerning consumer behavior on an individual level, but we may do so from time to time in the aggregate and on an anonymous basis to analyze our services and offerings, and better optimize them for improved business results. As the practice\nof targeted advertising has become increasingly scrutinized by both regulators and the industry alike, a greater emphasis has been placed on educating consumers about their privacy choices on the Internet, and providing them with the right to opt in or opt out of certain industry practices, such as targeted advertising. The common thread throughout both targeted advertising and the FTC requirements described in detail in the section \"Business - Government Regulation\" is the increased importance placed on transparency between the advertiser and the consumer to ensure that consumers know the difference between \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cadvertising\u201d on the Internet, and are afforded the opportunity to decide how their data will be used in the manner to which they are marketed. There is a risk regarding negative consumer perception \u201cof the practice of undisclosed compensation of social media users to endorse specific products\u201d which pertains to a risk of overall general public confidence in the FTC's ability to enforce its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising in social media. As described in the section \"Business - Government Regulation,\" we undertake various measures through controls across our platforms and by monitoring and enforcing our code of ethics to ensure that advertisers and creators comply with the FTC Guides when utilizing our sites, but if competitors and other companies do not, it could create a negative overall perception for the industry. Not only will readers stop relying on blogs for useful, timely and insightful information that enrich their lives by having access to up-to-the-minute information that often bears different perspectives and philosophies, but a lack of compliance will almost inevitably result in greater governmental oversight and involvement in an already-highly regulated marketplace. If there is pervasive overall negative perception caused by others not complying with FTC Guides among its other acts, regulations and policies, then this could result in reduced revenue and results of operations and higher compliance costs for us.\nNew tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of social media, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our creators to additional sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over social media. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over social media. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data, and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international privacy laws and regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. We have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of creator data on our websites and platforms. Several internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, FTC requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of creators or advertisers and adversely affect our business. Federal, state and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party web \"cookies\" for behavioral advertising. The regulation of these cookies and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our platforms and applications, and any significant disruption in service on our platforms and applications could result in a loss of creators or advertisers.\nCreators and advertisers access our services through our platforms and applications. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain, and serve our creators and advertisers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platforms and\napplications and the underlying network infrastructure. As our creator base continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts for data centers and equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the traffic on our platforms and applications. The operation of these systems is expensive and complex and could result in operational failures. In the event that our creator base or the amount of traffic on our platforms and applications grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our platforms and applications, and prevent our creators and advertisers from accessing our services. A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is hosted by third-party providers. Any disruption in these services or any failure of these providers to handle existing or increased traffic could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. If we do not maintain or expand our network infrastructure successfully or if we experience operational failures, we could lose current and potential creators and advertisers, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our platforms, our platforms and applications may be perceived as not being secure, advertisers and creators may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur platforms and applications and the network infrastructure that is hosted by third-party providers involve the storage and transmission of advertiser and creator proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, security flaws in the third party hosting service that we rely upon or any number of other reasons and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our advertisers' or creators' data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, advertisers or creators to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our advertisers' or creators' data. Although we do have security measures in place, we have had instances where some customers have used fraudulent credit cards in order to pay for our services. While these breaches of our security did not result in material harm to our business, any future breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our platforms and applications that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain and use unauthorized credit cards, obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely basis. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose advertisers, creators and vendors and have difficulty obtaining merchant processors or insurance coverage essential for our operations.\nIf our technology platforms contain defects, we may need to suspend their availability and our business and reputation would be harmed.\nPlatforms as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems. Many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial release of new platforms or enhancements to existing platforms. Although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before making our platforms available to them, our products are not error-free. These errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or delays in customer acceptance that would be detrimental to our business and reputation. We may not be able to detect and correct errors before releasing our product commercially. We cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known errors, considered minor by us, will not be considered serious by our customers, resulting in a decrease in our revenues.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits for information by our advertisers and our creators, which may affect our business.\nLaws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their advertisers or of social media content creators and for the content of their advertisers' listings are currently unsettled. It is unclear whether we could be subjected to claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories relating to the information we publish on our websites or the information that is published across our platforms. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, as well as print publications in the past. We may not successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by our advertisers or our creators. Our potential liability for unlawful activities of our advertisers or our creators or for the content of our advertisers' listings could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, which may require us, among other things, to spend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims and the\ndefense of such claims may divert the attention of our management from our operations. If we are subjected to such lawsuits, it may adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to detect click-fraud, we could lose the confidence of our advertisers and advertising partners as a result of lost revenue to advertisers or misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, thereby causing our business to suffer.\n\u201cClick-fraud\u201d is a form of online fraud when a person or computer program imitates a legitimate user by clicking on an advertisement for the purpose generating a charge per click without having an actual interest in the target of the advertisement's link. We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or illegitimate clicks on our sponsored listings. The security measures we have in place, which are designed to reduce the likelihood of click-fraud, detect click-fraud from time to time. While the instances of click-fraud that we have detected to date have not had a material effect on our business, click-fraud could result in an advertiser experiencing a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs because the fraudulent clicks will not lead to revenue for the advertisers. As a result, our advertisers and advertising partners may become dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which could lead to loss of advertisers, advertising partners and revenue. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to address problems caused by such breaches. Concerns over the security of the Internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also deter people from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, it may result in costly litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim our current or future products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could cause costly litigation that could consume significant management time. As the number of product and services offerings in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap, companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. These claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If required, we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements, or obtain them on terms acceptable to us.\nHistorically, we have not relied upon patents to protect our proprietary technology, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services which would harm our competitive position.\nOur success depends upon our proprietary technology. We do not have registered patents on any of our current platforms, because we determined that the costs of patent prosecution outweighed the benefits given the alternative of reliance upon copyright law to protect our computer code and other proprietary technology and properties. In addition to copyright laws, we rely upon service mark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.\nWe have developed a new platform called the IZEA Exchange (IZEAx). IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of content including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a wide variety of social channels including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and LinkedIn, among others. We have filed a patent application covering important features of this platform and own a registered trademark for \u201cNative Ad Exchange.\u201d. We are aggressively pursuing a patent application with the desired outcome of receiving a patent for the platform, although there can be no assurance thereof.\nOur market is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete, we must continually enhance our products and services.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of our products and services. The social sponsorship industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete. In the past, we have discovered that some of our customers desire additional performance and functionality not currently offered by our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our\nability to develop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of our technology and other proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging industry standards, we may not be able to increase our revenue and expand our business.\nDifficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have experienced a period of growth that has placed, and and will continue to place, a strain on our managerial and financial resources. As our business needs expand, we intend to hire new employees. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to:\n\u2022\nimprove existing, and implement new, operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\ninstall enhanced management information systems; and\n\u2022\ntrain, motivate and manage our employees.\nWe may not be able to install adequate management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business would be seriously harmed.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, including Edward H. Murphy, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan S. Schram, our Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Murphy, who is our founder, has unique knowledge regarding the social sponsorship space and business contacts that would be difficult to replace. Mr. Schram has sales, marketing and development expertise regarding our platforms that our other officers do not possess. Even though we have employment agreements in place with them, if Messrs. Murphy and Schram were to become unavailable to us, our operations would be adversely affected. We maintain \"key-man\" life insurance for our benefit in the amount of $1,500,000 on the life of Mr. Murphy, but not for any other officer. This insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for the loss of Mr. Murphy. Moreover, we have no insurance to compensate us for the loss of any other of our executive officers or key employees.\nOur future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified graphic designers, computer scientists, sales and marketing and senior management personnel. Competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them, particularly in the Orlando, Florida area where our headquarters are located. We have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. Failure to attract, assimilate and retain personnel, including key management, technical, sales and marketing personnel, would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, we also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult and costly for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nExercise of stock options, warrants and other securities will dilute your percentage of ownership and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of March 18, 2016, we had 5,339,944 shares of common stock issued, outstanding stock options to purchase 845,083 shares of common stock at an average price of $8.63 per share, and outstanding warrants to purchase 523,115 shares of common stock at an average price of $9.15 per share.\nAdditionally, we have reserved shares to issue stock options, restricted stock or other awards to purchase or receive up to 159,167 shares of common stock under our May 2011 Equity Incentive Plan and 61,215 shares of common stock under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In the future, we may grant additional stock options, restricted stock units, warrants and convertible securities. The exercise, conversion or exchange of stock options, restricted stock units, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our other stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities.\nThere may be substantial sales of our common stock under the prospectus relating to our 2013 and 2014 Private Placements, which could cause our stock price to drop.\nWe have two effective registration statements (File No. 333-191743 and File No. 333-197482) covering the resale of 1,378,276 shares of our common stock that may be offered by certain stockholders who participated in our 2013 Private Placement and loan consideration from August through September 2013 or who obtained shares of common stock for services. The number of shares the selling stockholders may sell consists of 1,278,300 shares of common stock that are currently issued and outstanding and 99,976 shares of common stock that they may receive if they exercise their warrants.\nWe also have a third effective registration statement (File No. 333-195081) covering the resale of 3,503,665 shares of our common stock that may be offered by certain stockholders who participated in our 2014 Private Placement. The number of shares the selling stockholders may sell consists of 3,107,129 shares of common stock that are currently issued and outstanding and 396,536 shares of common stock that they may receive if they exercise their warrants.\nThere are currently no agreements or understandings in place with these selling stockholders to restrict their sale of those shares. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders over a short period of time could cause the market price of our common stock to drop and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future by selling additional securities.\nOur earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other political conditions may cause a downturn in the market for our products or services. Despite the recent improvements in market conditions, a future downturn in the market for our products or services could adversely affect our operating results and increase the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. Our future operating results may be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated advertisers and creators; our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and services on a timely basis; changes in the mix of products developed, produced and sold; and disputes with our advertisers and creators. These factors affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our quarterly and/or annual operating results. The change in our earnings or general economic conditions may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nWhile our shares of common stock recently became listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in our industry;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nlimited \"public float\" in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market prices of our common stock;\n\u2022\nexpiration of any Rule 144 holding periods or registration of unregistered securities issued by us;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022\noperating results that fall below expectations;\n\u2022\nloss of any strategic relationship;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments; and\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 15943, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "IZEA"}
