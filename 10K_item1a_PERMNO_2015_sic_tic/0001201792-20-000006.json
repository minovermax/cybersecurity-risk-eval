RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. As a result of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as such additional risks and uncertainties, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Attracting and Retaining Students\nOur success and financial performance depends on the effectiveness of our ability to attract students who persist in our institutions\u2019 programs.\nBuilding awareness and reputation among potential students of our institutions and the programs they offer is critical to our institutions\u2019 ability to attract new students. In order to maintain and increase our revenue and profits, our institutions must continue to attract new, qualified students in a cost-effective manner, and these students must remain active in our institutions\u2019 programs. In addition, because our institutions experience declines in their student population as a result of graduation, transfers to other academic institutions, withdrawals, military deployments and other reasons, in order to grow we need to first attract sufficient students to replace those who have left. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our institutions\u2019 programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining qualified students in those programs include:\n\u2022\nchanges and revisions to policies of the DoD and the various military services;\n\u2022\nchallenges in maintaining strong relationships with military and military-affiliated communities;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of more, and more successful, competitors, and alternative education models;\n\u2022\nfactors related to our institutions\u2019 marketing, including the costs of internet advertising and multi-faceted interactive marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nchallenges in designing marketing campaigns that successfully attract college-ready students;\n\u2022\nthe reduced availability of, or higher interest rates and other costs associated with, Title IV loan funds or other sources of financial aid;\n\u2022\nperformance problems with our institutions\u2019 online systems;\n\u2022\nour institutions\u2019 failure to maintain accreditation, state authorization, eligibility for Title IV programs or other sources of financial aid, or other approvals;\n\u2022\nincreased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022\ninvestigations or litigation by government agencies, other regulators, or private parties that may limit our ability to operate or damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nchallenges in maintaining a positive reputation among students, employers, and other stakeholders;\n\u2022\nstudent dissatisfaction with our institutions\u2019 services and programs;\n\u2022\nfailure to develop, deliver and maintain a message or image for APUS that resonates well with non-military students;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity regarding us, our institutions, our competitors, or online or for-profit education generally;\n\u2022\na decline in the acceptance of online education generally; and\n\u2022\na decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our institutions\u2019 programs or programs provided by for-profit schools generally.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop awareness and reputation of our institutions and the programs we offer, and to recruit and enroll students that persist in our programs over time, our enrollments will suffer and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively market our programs, our operating results would be negatively affected.\nOur marketing strategy for APUS traditionally focused on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military, military-affiliated, and public service communities. However, with limitations on access to military students, as discussed further below under the Risk Factor that begins \u201cIf APUS does not have strong relationships with, and access to, various military installations . . .\u201d and with a continued focus on efforts to attract students outside of the military, we must continue to focus on marketing channels that attract college-ready students unaffiliated with the military who perform well at APUS. However, we have experienced challenges attracting college-ready students unaffiliated with the military who perform well at APUS, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on a cost-effective basis.\nFurthermore, because APUS\u2019s tuition is generally lower than that of most of its competitors, it has fewer dollars to spend per student on marketing and advertising than they do. Nevertheless, APUS has tried to, and may in the future try to, implement new marketing tactics and channels, including those with which it has no experience and which have no guarantee of success. For example, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in marketing expenditures for fiscal 2020, including to support a new advertising campaign focusing on affordability and return on investment for learners. If we are unable to develop and optimize marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness of our institutions and the programs we offer and their value propositions, and are unable to enroll and retain qualified students in military and non-military markets, our enrollments would suffer, and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of HCN depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase student enrollments in HCN\u2019s programs. Enrollments in HCN\u2019s ADN Program in 2019 were significantly lower than HCN planned, resulting in a significant decline in revenue in our HCN Segment. We believe the decline in enrollments is likely partly associated with the implementation of new academic achievement and admissions requirements, as well as negative perceptions by certain current and prospective student cohorts, among other potential factors. While we work on identifying the appropriate balance of academic achievement requirements, admissions requirements, and attracting appropriate students, as well as identifying and remediating the factors impacting enrollments, there may continue to be a negative impact on enrollments at HCN. We cannot predict whether our initiatives and efforts will be successful over the long term and cannot guarantee that we will be able to reverse the enrollment and revenue decline in our HCN Segment or return to our prior level of enrollments. Although we cannot predict what adjustments may be necessary or costs may be incurred as a result of the decline in enrollment at HCN, any such adjustments and costs may have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, with the opening of HCN\u2019s fifth campus in Toledo in January 2017 and the planned opening of HCN\u2019s sixth campus in Indianapolis, Indiana in the second quarter of 2020, we have been marketing in geographic areas in which HCN did not previously have a campus. If in the future we are unable to effectively market HCN\u2019s programs, we may not be able to successfully maintain and increase HCN enrollments, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nChanges our institutions may make to their operations to improve the student experience and enhance their ability to identify and enroll students who are likely to succeed may adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, profitability, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn order to improve the learning experience of our students and to attract students who are likely to persist in our institutions\u2019 programs, we have identified, and continue to work to identify, potential changes and initiatives that we believe will more effectively attract and enroll college-ready students, support those students, and help improve those students\u2019 educational outcomes, including through systems, faculty-related initiatives and co-curricular initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom and to strengthen the bond between APUS and its students. APUS has made multiple changes to its admissions assessment process and may further modify it in the future in order to better identify college-ready students. For example, APUS implemented a process in 2017 requiring enhanced certification of prospective non-military students\u2019 prior transcripts to confirm their authenticity and evaluate them for transfer credit.\nAdditional initiatives may include the following:\n\u2022\nfurther changing admissions standards and requirements;\n\u2022\nupdates to the admissions process and procedures;\n\u2022\nimplementing more stringent satisfactory academic progress standards;\n\u2022\nchanging tuition costs and payment options;\n\u2022\nexperimenting with additional CBE programs and other alternative delivery methods; and\n\u2022\naltering our institutions\u2019 marketing efforts to target the appropriate prospective students.\nHCN has also been implementing changes, including changes to its curriculum, admissions, and academic achievement and course retake policies, that are designed to improve NCLEX scores and retention rates over time.\nThese initiatives may adversely impact our institutions\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, particularly in the near term. These initiatives require significant time, energy, and resources. We may not succeed in achieving our objectives due to organizational, operational, regulatory, resource, or other constraints. If our efforts are not successful, we may experience reduced enrollment, increased expense, or other impacts on our business that materially and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Even if these initiatives successfully lead to the identification and enrollment of students who are likely to succeed and to improvements in student experience, they could result in adverse impacts on enrollments. Due to the many factors that can impact enrollments, we may not appropriately identify the cause of any adverse impacts, and therefore may not be able to appropriately modify our initiatives.\nIf APUS does not have strong relationships with, and access to, various military installations and installation education centers, our ability to maintain enrollments from military students and our future growth may be impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 57% of APUS\u2019s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment, and a significant portion of APUS students rely on DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education. We are highly dependent on our relationship with the military and its members, and our ability to attract and retain military service members as students. Because APUS relies on referrals and personal relationships for recruiting, impediments to access can have an adverse effect on maintaining and generating registrations from military students.\nDoD has issued briefings that prohibit base commanders from authorizing educational institutions to hold regular or recurring office hours solely to provide counseling and prohibit former military members from accessing installations to represent an educational institution using their government ID card privileges. This has adversely affected our efforts to support existing students and recruit new students. If we are not able to improve our access to military installations and our existing students on those installations, or find alternative methods to serve those students, our military enrollments could continue to decline. Furthermore, the DoD MOU, which specifies terms and conditions of participation in DoD tuition assistance programs and is discussed in more depth in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Department of Defense\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, and the related increased focus by DoD on relationships with and oversight of educational providers, or additional DoD restrictions, could lead to further adverse changes in the nature of our relationships with military installations and their education centers and our access to military service members.\nAn inability to maintain strong relationships with installation education centers and with military service members would have an adverse effect on APUS\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified students, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nEnrollments and course registrations by active duty service members may be adversely affected by a variety of factors not directly related to education programs, including changes in military activity and budgets.\nEvents not directly related to education programs that could occur in the future could lead to a reduction in registrations from students on active duty. For example, large-scale personnel reductions or other significant drawdowns of U.S. active duty military forces would likely have a negative effect on enrollment and course registrations. Increased operations and overseas deployments across all branches of the military and the related increased demands on many active duty service members, combined with limited internet access associated with some deployments, could also negatively impact the ability of certain active duty military students to pursue higher education.\nMilitary budget cuts or constraints could also negatively affect us by leading to force reductions or cuts to services and tools that we or APUS\u2019s students rely upon for recruitment, enrollment, access, and tuition assistance. Even temporary changes to military activity and budgets may adversely affect operations. For example, funding for the federal government, including the DoD, lapsed in January 2018 and February 2018, resulting in partial shutdowns that lasted for a few days and several hours, respectively. Funding for some portions of the federal government, not including DoD, lapsed on December 22, 2018, resulting in a partial government shutdown that lasted for 35 days. In addition, as a result of increased demand stemming from improvements in service delivery and raised limits on annual benefits available per sailor, tuition assistance benefits available to sailors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 were exhausted by the end of May 2019, and effective May 28, 2019 the Navy ceased approving tuition assistance program funds for eligible sailors until the start of the new government fiscal year on October 1, 2019. The temporary exhaustion of Navy tuition assistance program funds had a significant negative impact on our results of operations for the third quarter of 2019, and negatively impacted October 2019 revenue by approximately $0.4 million. Any future government shutdown or suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs could have a material adverse effect on APUS\u2019s enrollments.\nWe will remain subject to the risk of events that occur within and with respect to the military, even where they do not directly relate to the use of DoD tuition assistance programs. Because of our dependence on active duty military students, changes that occur within and with respect to the military could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nDoD tuition assistance programs offered to service members of the U.S. Armed Forces constituted approximately 39% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2019, and our revenue and number of students would decrease if APUS is no longer able to receive funds under these tuition assistance programs or if tuition assistance is reduced, eliminated, or suspended.\nService members of the U.S. Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the DoD tuition assistance programs. Service members may use DoD tuition assistance programs to pursue postsecondary education at institutions that are accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED and that satisfy other requirements, including execution of, and compliance with, an MOU that specifies terms and conditions of participation in DoD tuition assistance programs. Students participating in DoD tuition assistance programs constituted approximately 39% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2019.\nWe do not know the scale or nature of future actions that may be taken with respect to DoD tuition assistance programs, which could include eliminating those programs, reducing the funds, benefits, or level of reimbursement available thereunder, changing the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, enacting new restrictions on institutional participation or imposing other eligibility criteria on institutions, all of which could impact enrollments from service members. Other administrative changes to DoD programs could also have negative effects on our enrollments. For example, as discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Department of Defense,\u201d in March 2013, DoD restricted the ability of service members who have not previously taken a postsecondary education course and are in certain overseas duty locations to receive DoD tuition assistance for courses offered by institutions of higher education, such as APUS, that are not parties to contracts with DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. As a result, our ability to retain existing students or enroll new students who are service members at those locations was curtailed.\nChanges to eligibility requirements under the DoD tuition assistance programs have already occurred, and we expect there could be additional changes to the programs in the future. For example, as discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Department of Defense,\u201d several of the military services announced changes to their tuition assistance programs that took effect in federal fiscal years 2014 and 2018. In addition, effective October 1, 2019, all Navy service members must have a minimum of two years of service before becoming eligible to use tuition assistance or the Navy College Program for Afloat College Education, funding is capped at twelve semester hours per fiscal year, and career funding is capped at 120 semester hours. These policies could have a negative impact on our enrollments. Additional changes to DoD tuition assistance programs could occur due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes. Annual tuition assistance funding is limited and could be exhausted in any given year due to budget constraints or changes in demand or policy. For example, as a result of increased demand stemming from improvements in service delivery and raised limits on annual benefits available per sailor, tuition assistance benefits available to sailors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 were exhausted by the end of May 2019, and effective May 28, 2019 the Navy ceased approving tuition assistance program funds for eligible sailors until the start of the new government fiscal year on October 1, 2019. The temporary exhaustion of Navy tuition assistance program funds had a significant negative impact on our results of operations for the third quarter of 2019, and negatively impacted October 2019 revenue by approximately $0.4 million. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent the Navy will continue to impose limitations on tuition assistance program approvals as a result of limited funding. Furthermore, in March 2020, the Navy announced a new \u201cEducation Strategy for Seapower 2020\u201d that is intended to be a new comprehensive education strategy. While the details and impact of this particular strategy are still uncertain, we expect each military branch and the DoD to continually evaluate their approaches to education, and any resulting changes could have an impact on the funds available to service members to pursue their education at our institutions. Changes in funding allocations could have a material adverse effect on APUS\u2019s enrollments.\nIf we are no longer able to receive funds from DoD tuition assistance programs, or if those programs are modified, reduced, eliminated, or temporarily suspended, our enrollments and revenue could be significantly reduced, which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have limited experience participating in the DoD\u2019s credentialing assistance programs, and changes to credentialing assistance programs or funding could have an adverse impact on our business strategy and results of operations.\nAs discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Defense\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, branches of the U.S. military offer credentialing assistance, which links soldiers to and in many cases provides funds for approved training courses or exams related to occupational\ncertifications, and associated books, supplies and materials. While benefits vary by service, service members may be eligible for assistance in paying for certifications, including by vouchers, reimbursement, or grants. Our ability to comply with regulatory requirements related to credentialing assistance and to enroll students in programs eligible for credentialing assistance remains uncertain. We have limited experience in offering programs eligible for credentialing assistance and have few current offerings in credentialing assistance, and as a result may not be as recognized for credentialing assistance as other providers that have developed or may develop a stronger brand. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to enroll students in credentialing assistance programs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, and our plans to increase the use of credentialing assistance at APUS.\nThe Army is now offering an expanded credentialing program called the Army Credentialing Assistance Program, or CA. Students in the Army may use both DoD tuition assistance and credentialing assistance for CA, subject to a combined cap on benefit amounts. As a result, soldiers that take advantage of one of these forms of assistance may not be able to use the other form to the extent that they otherwise might, which could adversely impact enrollments and our results of operations. Over time, it is possible that increased use of credentialing assistance could result in fewer funds being used or available for tuition assistance. In addition, to be eligible for credentialing assistance, students must meet certain eligibility requirements, including in some cases service time, experience and DoD tuition assistance eligibility requirements, and the training program must also be eligible.\nWhile we believe other service branches may follow the Army\u2019s example in expanding their credentialing programs or pursue other approaches to enhancing support for credentialing, there can be no assurance that they will do so or that we will benefit from any such expansion or enhancement. In addition, the DoD and military branches could eliminate credentialing assistance programs, reducing the funds, benefits, or level of reimbursement available for credentialing, change the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, enact new restrictions on institutional participation or impose other eligibility criteria on institutions, all of which could impact enrollments from service members. Changes to DoD tuition assistance programs and funds could also have an impact on credentialing assistance programs and funds, and vice versa.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully adjust to future market demands by updating and expanding the content of existing programs and developing new programs, specializations, and modes of teaching on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our performance may be impaired.\nWe believe that our institutions need to continuously update and expand the content of their existing programs and develop new programs, specializations, and modes of teaching in order to continue to retain and attract qualified students. However, the updates and expansions of our institutions\u2019 existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by their accreditors, state regulators, ED, existing or prospective students, or employers. If we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our institutions may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. If we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations, or other factors, our institutions\u2019 ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs, specializations, and modes of teaching or modifying or eliminating existing programs requires our institutions to make investments in management, academic resources including faculty, and capital expenditures, incur marketing expenses, and reallocate other resources. Our institutions may have limited experience providing courses in new fields of study or new modes of teaching (such as CBE, micro-credentials, or other non-degree credentials) and may need to modify systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other institutions and organizations to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If our institutions are unable to establish new academic programs, increase the number of students enrolling in new academic programs, offer programs in a cost-effective manner, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of those programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully pursue HCN\u2019s program initiatives and expansions, including opening new HCN campuses, our future growth may be impaired.\nWe experienced decreases in enrollment at HCN in 2019, which resulted in a significant decline in revenue in our HCN Segment. The success of HCN will depend on our ability to maintain and increase student enrollments in HCN\u2019s programs and grow HCN\u2019s on-campus offerings. As part of our strategy, we intend to open new campuses for HCN, such as the new campus in suburban Toledo, Ohio that began operations in early 2017, and the new campus in Indianapolis, Indiana that we expect to begin operations in the second quarter of 2020. Such actions require us to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency\napprovals and to comply with any requirements from those agencies related to a new location. For example, under ABHES rules, HCN was not permitted to seek ABHES approval for a new location until twelve months after HCN received its initial ABHES accreditation in June 2018. Adding new locations may also require significant financial investments, human resource capabilities, and new clinical placement relationships. In addition, regulatory authorities may place limitations or restrictions on new programs or campuses, including by only provisionally accrediting programs or limiting the number of initial enrollees. For example, in November 2019, the Indiana State Board of Nursing voted to grant initial accreditation for a PN Program at HCN\u2019s Indianapolis campus, but growth beyond an initial cohort of up to 30 students for the first year is subject to HCN\u2019s ability to petition to increase the number of admissions after a site visit that will occur upon graduation of the first cohort. The Indiana State Board of Nursing will not grant the Indianapolis campus full accreditation status until the first cohort graduates, and may not grant full accreditation at that time if the program has a pass rate lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate.\nIf we are unable to, or suffer any delay in our ability to, obtain appropriate approvals, attract additional students to new campus locations, offer programs at new campuses in a cost-effective manner, identify appropriate clinical placements, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established campuses, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the inability to expand efficiently or successfully existing programs, pursue new program initiatives, and add new campuses would harm our ability to grow the business and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nStrong competition in the postsecondary education market could decrease our institutions\u2019 market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.\nWithin the postsecondary education market, our institutions compete primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges, as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. These institutions may have instructional and support resources, or course delivery tools, that are superior to those of our institutions and other for-profit schools. Many of these competitors, whether for-profit, not-for-profit, or public, are also able to leverage their greater scale and size to more efficiently compete. Many of our competitors also have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students, or to provide instructional and support resources that are superior to those of our institutions and other for-profit schools. In addition, the DoD and military services may establish their own undergraduate education programs and begin offering distance learning for graduate degrees through their own institutions. Within the postsecondary education market generally, we have experienced increased competition, including the entrance of additional providers of online and non-traditional programs, a shift of for-profit institutions to not-for-profit status, and declines or slower growth in the total postsecondary student population. According to the National Student Clearinghouse, enrollment in Title IV postsecondary degree-granting institutions in the fall of 2019 decreased 1.3%, compared to the fall of 2018, with a decrease of 2.1% taking place among four-year for-profit schools. Longer term projections suggest that previous growth in enrollment in postsecondary degree-granting institutions is slowing. According to a May 2019 report from ED, such enrollment was projected to grow 3% over the 11-year period ending in fall of 2028, compared to 27% growth over the 17-year period that ended in 2017. The combination of reduced growth or declines in the postsecondary student population and the entrance of additional providers in the online postsecondary education market will further intensify competition, and any decline in the number of enrollments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, increased competition for college-ready students has led to an increase in the cost of advertising in certain marketing channels. Continued increases in the cost of advertising may adversely impact our ability to attract college-ready students and/or increase our student acquisition costs.\nWe expect to continue to face greater competition from non-traditional offerings, provided by both educational institutions and non-traditional providers.\nIn recent years, competing institutions and others have started providing non-traditional education programs without charge or at low costs, including CBE programs, coding bootcamps, and micro-credentialing. We believe that our institutions will continue to face new competition from non-traditional programs, including lower cost programs. While we are working to develop our own alternatives in some of these areas, including through the launch of Momentum, a collection of CBE programs at APUS, in the first quarter of 2017, other institutions have programs that are more fully developed, and our offerings may not receive market acceptance. Since May 2018, APUS has limited enrollments in Momentum until system infrastructure is upgraded. Our institutions may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect their business or results of operations. Increased availability of federal student financial aid for CBE programs could create additional competition and drive additional students toward non-traditional\neducation programs. These competitive factors could cause our institutions\u2019 enrollments, revenue, and profitability to decrease significantly.\nStrong competition in the military market could decrease our institutions\u2019 market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.\nWe anticipate that APUS will continue to see strong competition within the military market, which continues to be a primary market for APUS. There are a number of for-profit schools and not-for-profit institutions that focus on the military market because of the size of the market and the availability of funding, and some for-profit schools seek to attract students eligible for DoD tuition assistance programs, VA education benefits, or both, at least in part as a strategy of those institutions to satisfy the 90/10 Rule, which is described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The \u201890/10 Rule.\u2019\u201d Some of these institutions may develop relationships with the military and education service officers that are stronger than APUS\u2019s, which could have an adverse effect on APUS\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified students, and ultimately, on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nIf we or our institutions fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for the operation of postsecondary education institutions, we and our institutions could face penalties and significant restrictions on operations, including loss of access to DoD tuition assistance programs and federal student loans and grants.\nWe and our institutions are subject to extensive regulation by (i) accrediting agencies, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government through ED. APUS and HCN also are subject to DoD and VA oversight because APUS and HCN participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and veterans\u2019 education benefits programs administered by the VA. Regulations, standards, and policies of these organizations address the vast majority of our institutions\u2019 operations, including their educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and financial condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to acquire new institutions, open new locations, add new or expand existing educational programs, change our corporate structure or ownership, and make other substantive changes. These requirements can also increase our cost of operations.\nFindings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards, and policies could result in any of the relevant regulatory agencies taking action including: imposing monetary fines, penalties, or injunctions; limiting operations, including restricting our institutions\u2019 ability to offer new programs of study or to open new locations, or imposing limits on our growth; limiting or terminating our ability to grant degrees; restricting or revoking our institutions\u2019 accreditation, licensure, or other approval to operate; limiting, suspending, or terminating our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, DoD tuition assistance programs, or VA education benefit programs; requiring us to repay funds, post a letter of credit, or become subject to payment methods for Title IV programs that are not the advance payment system; subjecting us to civil or criminal penalties; or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe regulations, standards, and policies of ED, state regulatory bodies, and our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies change frequently and are subject to interpretive ambiguities. Recent and pending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under DoD tuition assistance programs, ability to participate in Title IV programs, ability to participate in VA education benefit programs, or costs of doing business. We cannot predict with certainty how these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply, or will be deemed by others to have complied, with all of the requirements.\nIn addition, in some circumstances of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance, we may be subject to lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act, similar state false claim statutes, or various \u201cwhistleblower\u201d statutes. These lawsuits in some cases can be prosecuted by a private plaintiff in respect of some action taken by us, even if ED or another regulatory body does not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability, or the government can intervene and become a party to the lawsuit. These lawsuits have the potential to generate significant financial liability linked to our receipt of government funds, including Title IV funding and DoD tuition assistance funds.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain their institutional accreditation, they would lose the ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs.\nAccreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by ED is required for participation in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs. APUS and HCN participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs. As\ndescribed more fully in each operating segment\u2019s section in \u201cOur Institutions - Accreditation\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Accreditation,\u201d APUS is accredited by HLC and HCN is accredited by ABHES, which are institutional accrediting agencies recognized by ED.\nOur institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies may impose restrictions on their accreditation or may terminate their accreditation. To remain accredited, our institutions must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources, and financial stability. Our institutions also must comply with accrediting agency policies and requirements, such as the requirements to apply and wait for approval before making certain changes. For example, in connection with the implementation of a shared services model with APEI, APUS was required to submit a change in structure application to HLC. In November 2018, HLC approved the change in structure application and extended APUS\u2019s accreditation following adoption of the shared services model, and we entered into intercompany agreements to implement the model.\nFailure to meet accreditation criteria or standards or to comply with accreditation policies and requirements could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agency. The complete loss of institutional accreditation at one of our institutions would, among other things, render the institution and its students ineligible to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs, and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nHCN recently changed accrediting bodies and must satisfy accreditation standards, including specific student achievement indicators, with which it has not historically had to comply.\nHCN is accredited by ABHES. Some of the ABHES accreditation standards differ from those HCN historically needed to meet under the requirements of ACICS, HCN\u2019s former accreditor, which accredited HCN until October 1, 2018. We have limited experience complying with ABHES requirements. ABHES imposes certain limitations on newly accredited institutions, including a prohibition on applying for a new non-main or satellite campus during the first twelve months after receiving initial accreditation.\nIn addition, ABHES annually reviews student achievement indicators, including retention rate, placement rate, and licensing and credentialing examination pass rate. Under ABHES policy, ABHES may withdraw accreditation at any time if it determines that an institution fails to demonstrate at least a 70% retention rate for each program, a 70% placement rate for each program, and a 70% pass rate on mandatory licensing and credentialing examinations, or fails to meet state-mandated results for credentialing or licensure. Alternatively, ABHES may in its discretion provide an opportunity for a program to come into compliance within a period of time specified by ABHES, and ABHES may extend the period for achieving compliance if a program demonstrates improvement over time or other good cause. For the reporting year ended June 30, 2018, several HCN programs did not satisfy ABHES\u2019s threshold requirements for retention rates or placement rates. As a result, in February 2019, ABHES directed HCN to provide evidence to ABHES that the relevant programs had achieved a retention rate of at least 70% for the period from July 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019 and a placement rate of at least 70% for the reporting year ended June 30, 2018, along with additional documentation and analysis related to those rates and pertinent action plans. HCN timely submitted the required progress report. For the reporting year ending June 30, 2019, each of HCN\u2019s programs at each of HCN\u2019s campuses satisfied ABHES\u2019s placement rate requirements but failed to satisfy ABHES\u2019s threshold requirements for retention rates.\nIn August 2019, ABHES notified HCN that ABHES had placed HCN\u2019s Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo locations on outcomes reporting status, which requires submission of additional documentation regarding student outcomes and action plans for improving these outcomes, with respect to the reporting year ended June 30, 2018. ABHES determined that the PN Program at each of the Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo campuses did not satisfy ABHES\u2019s retention rate requirement and that it was unable to verify that the ADN Program at each of the Cleveland and Toledo campuses had met ABHES\u2019s placement rate requirement. In August 2019, ABHES notified HCN that the relevant programs at the Cleveland, Dayton, and Toledo campuses must come into compliance by May 1, 2020 and that the PN Program at the Columbus campus must come into compliance by May 1, 2021. In October 2019, HCN notified ABHES that the PN Programs at each of the Dayton, Toledo, and Columbus campuses failed to satisfy ABHES\u2019s threshold requirements for retention rates for the reporting year ended June 30, 2019. In February 2020, ABHES notified HCN that it had taken additional actions with respect to certain HCN programs at certain locations related to those programs\u2019 performance in relation to ABHES student achievement indicators. Specifically, ABHES: (i) placed the PN programs at the Dayton and Toledo campuses on program specific warning status because the programs have failed to meet the 70% retention rate threshold since HCN\u2019s 2017-2018 annual report and informed HCN that those programs must meet the retention rate threshold by May 1, 2020; (ii) removed the ADN programs at the Cleveland and Toledo campuses from outcomes reporting status after placement rates for those programs at those locations met the 70% compliance threshold; (iii) continued outcomes reporting status for the PN program at the Columbus campus because it has not met the retention rate\ncompliance threshold and reconfirmed that it has until May 1, 2021 to do so; and (iv) directed HCN to provide evidence to ABHES that the ADN programs at each of the Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Toledo campuses and the PN programs at the Cleveland and Cincinnati campuses met the retention rate compliance threshold for the period from July 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020 and informed HCN that those programs must meet the compliance threshold by May 1, 2021. There can be no assurance that HCN will be able to demonstrate compliance by the relevant deadlines in all cases. If HCN is unable to bring the programs into compliance during the timeframe established by ABHES, unless such timeframe is extended for good cause, ABHES may take other action, up to and including withdrawing accreditation for those programs. In addition, adverse actions taken by ABHES may trigger reporting requirements and ED action under ED\u2019s Borrower Defense Regulations, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Borrower Defenses.\u201d\nIf any HCN campus or program fails to satisfy ABHES achievement measures, enrollment in such HCN campus or program could decline, or we could be forced to cease enrollments at that campus or in that program, which could have a material adverse impact on HCN\u2019s student enrollment and our and HCN\u2019s revenue, cash flows, and results of operations. The actions HCN takes to comply with ABHES requirements may not be successful in resolving existing issues and, if those actions are targeted at specific campuses or programs, may fail to prevent additional issues arising with respect to those or other campuses or programs. Similarly, even if HCN is successful in the long term in complying with these standards, the actions HCN takes to comply could result in increased costs or decreased enrollments.\nParticipation in the DoD tuition assistance programs requires compliance with numerous regulations with respect to which the failure to comply could lead to a loss of an ability to participate in these programs or other adverse events.\nIn order to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs, institutions must, among other things, comply with an MOU that specifies terms and conditions of participation in DoD tuition assistance programs. By signing the MOU, APUS and HCN have agreed to participate in DoD\u2019s Voluntary Education Institutional Compliance Program, or ICP. An institution that is found noncompliant with DoD requirements through the ICP and demonstrates an unwillingness to resolve a finding may be subject to a range of penalties from a written warning to termination of the institution\u2019s participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs. For example, as more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations - Compliance Reviews,\u201d in February 2018, DoD issued a report that made two findings about APUS. First, DoD found that attire worn by an individual providing testimonials on APUS\u2019s public-facing website could be construed as similar to a distinctive part of a military uniform. Second, DoD found that APUS had failed to provide sufficient information relating to the financial aid process, including a timeline for applying for financial aid. APUS submitted a corrective action plan and evidence of corrective actions, and in December 2018, DoD notified APUS that all corrective actions had been reviewed and accepted by DoD. If we are no longer able to receive funds from DoD tuition assistance programs, or if those programs are reduced, eliminated, or temporarily suspended, our enrollments and revenue could be significantly reduced, which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur institutions\u2019 student enrollments could decline if they fail to maintain accreditation.\nInstitutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Many institutions will only accept transfer credit from regionally accredited institutions. Students and sponsors of tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for quality assurance, and employers rely on institutions\u2019 accredited status when evaluating a candidate\u2019s credentials. Failure to maintain our institutional accreditation would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations. In addition, certain of our programs are accredited by specialized accrediting agencies, or recognized by professional organizations. If our institutions fail to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies and professional organizations, the relevant programs could lose the specialized accreditation or professional recognition, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, in certain cases, professional licensure will not be granted if an applicant for licensure earned the relevant educational credential from an institution or educational program that lacks regional or specialized accreditation. Failure to obtain or maintain specialized accreditation or professional recognition for certain programs could result in materially reduced student enrollments in affected programs and have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf the accrediting agency of one of our institutions was to lose its ability to serve as an accrediting agency for Title IV program purposes and the institution was unable to obtain recognition from another recognized accrediting agency, that institution would lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs.\nAPUS is accredited by HLC. In February 2018, NACIQI, the panel charged with advising ED on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for Title IV purposes, voted to recommend that ED renew HLC\u2019s recognition for five years. If HLC were to\nlose its recognition as an accrediting agency and APUS was unable to obtain recognition from another recognized accrediting agency, APUS would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs. The inability of APUS to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenue, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHCN is accredited by ABHES. In 2016, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew ABHES\u2019s recognition for five years. If ABHES were to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency and HCN was unable to obtain recognition from another recognized accrediting agency, HCN would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs. The ineligibility of HCN to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on HCN\u2019s enrollments, revenue, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure of our institutions or their accrediting agencies to comply with Department of Education regulations setting forth new standards and procedures related to institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV and ED\u2019s recognition of accrediting agencies could affect our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn October 2018, ED announced that it would establish the Accreditation and Innovation Committee to prepare proposed regulations related to, among other things, ED\u2019s recognition of accrediting agencies and institutional and program eligibility issues, including state authorization and programs offered through distance education. In April 2019, the Accreditation and Innovation Committee reached consensus on the package of proposed regulatory language. In June 2019, ED published certain portions of the agreed-upon regulatory language, including those provisions related to accreditation and state authorization, in a notice of proposed rulemaking. On November 1, 2019, ED published final regulations concerning accreditation and state authorization, portions of which relating to accreditation generally will be effective on July 1, 2020. The final regulations revise ED\u2019s process for recognition and review of accrediting agencies and the criteria used by ED to recognize accrediting agencies. The regulations also revise ED\u2019s requirements for accrediting agency oversight of accredited institutions and programs by generally providing accrediting agencies with greater autonomy and flexibility. On December 11, 2019, in a notice of proposed rulemaking, ED published additional portions of the agreed-upon regulatory language, including provisions related to the participation of faith-based entities in the Title IV programs and certain rules related to the TEACH Grant program. ED has indicated that it will issue an additional notice of proposed rulemaking to address other provisions in the agreed-upon regulatory language developed as part of the negotiated rulemaking. We are unable to predict the result of any other current or future rulemakings, or the impact of such rulemakings on our business. However, the failure of our institutions or their accrediting agencies to comply with any final regulations could affect our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNational or regional accreditation agencies may prescribe more rigorous accreditation standards or special forms of monitoring or action plans for our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our student enrollment, revenue, and cash flows.\nThe accreditation standards of the regional or national accreditation agencies that accredit our institutions can and do vary, and the accreditation agencies may prescribe more rigorous standards than are currently in place. Complying with more rigorous accreditation standards could require significant changes to the way we operate our business and increase our administrative and other costs. No assurances can be given that our institutions would be able to comply with more rigorous accreditation standards in a timely manner or at all. If one of our institutions does not meet its accreditation requirements, its accreditation could be limited, modified, suspended, or terminated. Failure to maintain accreditation would make such institution ineligible to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on the institution\u2019s student enrollment and revenue.\nAccrediting bodies may adopt new or revised criteria, standards, and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate, or limit the growth of for-profit institutions like ours. For example, as discussed more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Accreditation,\u201d HLC has adopted a policy to allow HLC to designate publicly an institution as \u201cin financial distress\u201d or \u201cunder governmental investigation\u201d where such situations have the potential to impact the institution\u2019s operations and HLC believes the public should have information in making a decision to attend or continue to attend the institution. As discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Accreditation,\u201d HLC imposed a \u201cgovernmental investigation\u201d designation on APUS in February 2018 in connection with a CID issued to APUS by the Attorney General of Massachusetts in July 2017. HLC removed the governmental investigation designation in August 2018 in light of action taken to resolve the CID.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain state authorization in the states where they are physically located, the institutions would lose their ability to grant degrees and other credentials in that state and to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs.\nAs discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization,\u201d to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs, an institution must be legally authorized by the relevant education agency of the state in which it is physically located. Loss of state authorization by one of our institutions in the state in which it is physically located would cause that institution to be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs and to be unable to operate in the state and grant credentials. In addition, if one of our institutions were to lose its state authorization, it would lose its institutional accreditation, and if HCN were to lose approval from OBN for the Diploma in Practical Nursing or the Associate Degree in Nursing, or from the Indiana Board of Nursing for the Diploma in Practical Nursing, students in the program lacking approval would not be eligible to apply for licensure by examination to practice nursing in Ohio or Indiana, respectively.\nED regulations provide that an institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws, and the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements. If a state in which one of our institutions is located fails in the future to satisfy the provisions of that regulation, our institutions\u2019 ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs could be limited or terminated.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to comply with the requirements of the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, or regulations of ED or various states related to state authorization could result in actions that would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nVarious states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries, including registration requirements applicable to online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. SARA is a voluntary agreement among member states, districts, and territories that establishes national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education. For U.S. jurisdictions that are not members of SARA (namely, at this time, California), our institutions must satisfy the requirements of those individual jurisdictions with regard to online education in order to enroll students in those jurisdictions. Those requirements may change from time to time and, in some instances, are ambiguous or are left to the interpretative discretion of state regulators.\nChanges in requirements to participate in SARA or changes to state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the applicable regulators may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees. If one of our institutions were to fail to comply with SARA requirements or state licensing or authorization requirements to provide distance education in a non-SARA jurisdiction, the institution could lose its ability to participate in SARA or may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization to provide distance education in that non-SARA jurisdiction, respectively. If one of our institutions were to fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, it could be subject to injunctive actions or penalties.\nOn December 19, 2016, ED published the Distance Education Rule, which is more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization\u201d, addressing, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education. After a delay and subsequent court order, the Distance Education Rule took effect on May 26, 2019. The Distance Education Rule requires an institution offering distance education programs to be authorized on a state-by-state basis, if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students. If one of our institutions fails to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state, the institution could lose its ability to award Title IV aid to students in that state and to provide distance education in that state. The Distance Education Rule also requires an institution to provide public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs that are provided or can be completed solely through distance education or correspondence courses, excluding internships and practicums.\nIn October 2018, ED announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations related to, among other things, disclosure and other requirements of state authorization. On November 1, 2019, ED published final regulations concerning accreditation and state authorization, which generally will be effective on July 1, 2020, except that institutions may in their discretion implement early regulations relating to state authorization and institutional information disclosures. The final regulations related to state authorization effectively replace the Distance Education Rule. APUS implemented early these regulations effective November 1, 2019. The final regulations clarify the required methodology for determining the state in which a student is located for purposes of satisfying state authorization requirements for distance education courses, and require an institution to disclose certain information related to whether programs leading to professional licensure meet applicable state requirements, regardless of program modality. Failure to make the disclosures required by the Distance Education Rule or its replacement regulations could put us at risk of administrative enforcement action or related litigation, including claims from students related to misrepresentation and other matters. In addition, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, such disclosure requirements will have an effect on our enrollment processes and results.\nThe inability of our institutions\u2019 graduates to obtain professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenue, limit our ability to offer educational programs, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nHCN graduates and certain APUS graduates seek professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on numerous factors, including: the individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and whether the institution or program has any required accreditation. For example, certain states have refused to license or certify students from particular APUS initial teacher licensure programs on grounds that the program did not meet one or more of the state\u2019s specific licensure requirements or was not approved by the state for purposes of professional licensure. APUS has determined not to enroll new students in any of its initial teacher licensure programs.\nTo apply for licensure to practice nursing in Ohio, an applicant must have successfully completed a nursing education program that is approved by the OBN. The OBN requires that nursing education programs such as HCN\u2019s PN and ADN Programs have a pass rate on the relevant NCLEX that is at least 95% of the national average for first-time candidates in a calendar year. As discussed more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions,\u201d failure to satisfy that requirement can result in the OBN taking certain adverse actions, including placement of a program on provisional status or withdrawal of approval pursuant to an adjudication proceeding. In March 2017, the OBN placed HCN\u2019s ADN Program on provisional approval because the ADN Program has not met the OBN pass rate standard for four consecutive years. In March 2019, the OBN found that HCN\u2019s ADN Program did not meet the OBN pass rate standard in 2018 for a sixth consecutive year. HCN has been implementing changes, including curriculum, admissions, and academic achievement and course retake policy changes that are designed to improve NCLEX scores over time, but there is no assurance that these changes will be successful or will not have negative effects on HCN\u2019s enrollment. For example, enrollments in HCN\u2019s ADN Program in 2019 were significantly lower than HCN planned, which we believe is likely partly associated with the implementation of new academic achievement and admissions standards that had the effect of reducing enrollments from qualified students. If HCN is unable to improve NCLEX scores over time, this situation could have an adverse impact on our ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue HCN\u2019s ADN Program, any of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. The Indiana State Board of Nursing also requires that nursing education programs have a pass rate on the relevant NCLEX exam that satisfies certain requirements. The Indiana State Board of Nursing may not grant full accreditation to an initially accredited program that has a pass rate is lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate, and if the program\u2019s pass rate is lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate for three consecutive years, a program may be subject to additional oversight or a change in accreditation status.\nState requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are professional certification standards, and we may not become aware of changes that may impact our students in certain instances. In the event that one or more states refuse to recognize our institutions\u2019 students for professional licensure based on factors relating to our institutions or programs, the potential growth of our institutions\u2019 programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, requirements for employment vary from employer to employer and from field to field. To the extent our graduates fail to satisfy requirements for employment by particular employers or in a particular profession based on characteristics of our programs, the ability to maintain enrollments, as well as the potential for growth of our institutions\u2019 programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, if our institutions\u2019 graduates fail to obtain professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields of study, we and our institutions could be exposed to litigation, including class-action litigation, claiming that we are at fault for such failure, which would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs, and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department of Education prior to seeking recertification, and our future success may be adversely affected if our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification.\nAn institution generally must seek recertification from ED at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors, such as whether it is provisionally certified. ED may also review an institution\u2019s continued eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs, or scope of eligibility and certification, in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, or expands its activities in certain ways. In certain circumstances, ED must provisionally certify an institution, such as when it is an initial participant in Title IV programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control.\nA provisionally-certified institution must apply for and receive ED approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If ED determines that a provisionally-certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities, it may seek to revoke the institution\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully-certified.\nAPUS is certified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2020 and will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after that date. As discussed more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations - Compliance Reviews,\u201d in September 2016, ED began a program review of APUS\u2019s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years, and that program review remains open and ongoing. If the program review and any associated liabilities remain unresolved at the time ED acts on APUS\u2019s recertification application and ED decides to recertify APUS, we believe such recertification is likely to be on a provisional basis because of the unresolved program review and associated liabilities. HCN is certified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2021 and will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after that date.\nIf ED were to withdraw or not renew our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs, our students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds or DoD tuition assistance program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification to participate in Title IV programs they will not be able to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification to participate in ED\u2019s Title IV programs, they will not be able to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs because the DoD MOU requires an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV programs in order to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. Loss of participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nED\u2019s regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV programs and the sanctions ED may impose if an institution fails to satisfy any of those criteria. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things, comply with all applicable Title IV requirements, including with respect to the administration of Title IV programs and the processing of Title IV program funds. If an institution fails to satisfy any of the administrative capability requirements, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to heightened cash monitoring status, or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d method of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.\nIf one of our institutions is found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements, it could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV program funding or certain Title IV-related conditions or fines could be imposed, which would adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility by one of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by ED, or post a letter of credit in favor of ED, and possibly accept other conditions, such as provisional certification, additional reporting requirements, or regulatory oversight of its participation in Title IV programs. ED may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to a parent company of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the parent company, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of ED, and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. For our institutions, ED applies its measures of financial responsibility at the level of the parent company, APEI. An obligation to post a letter of credit, or to accept other conditions, such as a change in our system of Title IV payment from ED for purposes of disbursement, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance, or affect our cash flow.\nIn the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, ED modified its financial responsibility standards to provide that an institution (other than a public institution) may not be able to meet its financial or administrative obligations, and is therefore not financially responsible, if it is subject to one or more triggering events occurring on or after July 1, 2017. On September 23, 2019, ED published the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations, which, among other things, amend ED\u2019s financial responsibility provisions in several respects. Like the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations identify certain conditions or other triggering events that have or may have an adverse material effect on the institution\u2019s financial condition, in response to which ED would or could require that the institution submit some form of financial protection to ED. For more on the financial responsibility provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Borrower Defenses.\u201d\nIf, under the Borrower Defense Regulations, ED determines that one of our institutions is not financially responsible because of one or more triggering events, the institution would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit equal to at least 10% of the amount of federal student financial aid funds received by the institution for the past year. If one of our institutions is found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s financial responsibility requirements, it could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, and results of operations. If we, as the parent company of an eligible institution, are found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s financial responsibility measures, all of our institutions could be limited in their access to, or lose, Title IV program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and financial position.\nED rules now in effect and subsequent rules that take effect July 1, 2020, each setting forth new standards and procedures related to borrower defense-to-repayment claims, and requirements related to dispute resolution, may create significant liability that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. Regulations in effect prior to the 2016 Defense Regulations permitted a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution\u2019s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. The 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, which in part govern which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a student borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program, or a Direct Loan, and certain other matters, create a new federal standard for borrower defenses, new limitation periods for borrower defense claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. Certain portions of the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations became effective October 16, 2018 after ED\u2019s delay of the effective date of those regulations and a court decision in legal challenges to the delay. On September 23, 2019, ED published the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations, which among other things establish a new federal standard for evaluating, and a new process for adjudicating, borrower defenses to repayment of loans made under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2020. The 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations thereafter will continue to apply to all loans made under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2017 and before July 1, 2020. For more information on the Borrower Defense Regulations, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Borrower Defenses.\u201d\nUnder the Borrower Defense Regulations, ED may initiate a separate proceeding to collect from an institution the amount of relief resulting from a borrower defense brought by an individual borrower, and as part of group-process hearings under the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, ED will collect from the institution any liability for amounts discharged or reimbursed to borrowers under the group process. The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations eliminate the process available under the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations for a group of borrowers. If ED determines that borrowers of Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loans, we could be subject to repayment liability to ED that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations also prohibit institutions from requiring students to engage in the institutions\u2019 internal complaint processes before contacting other agencies, prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements by institutions, prohibit class action lawsuit waivers, and require institutions to notify ED of arbitration filings and awards, for claims that may form the basis for a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. As a result of the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations\u2019 dispute resolution provisions, we could incur claims and expenses that we have not previously incurred, and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations generally remove the prohibitions contained in the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations but require institutions whose students must enter into pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers as a condition of enrollment to disclose publicly those requirements in an easily accessible format, and prohibit such an institution to require a student to participate in arbitration or any internal dispute resolution process prior to filing a borrower defense to repayment application with ED.\nIf one or more of our institutions does not comply with the 90/10 Rule, it or they will lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs.\nThe HEA requires all for-profit education institutions to comply with what is commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, which imposes sanctions on institutions that derive more than 90% of their total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs, as calculated under ED\u2019s regulations. In recent years, Congress has considered various proposals that would modify the 90/10 Rule. At this time we cannot predict whether Congress will pass legislation to modify the 90/10 Rule. Such proposals, or other similar legislation, should they become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions.\nThe 90/10 Rule percentage for our institutions could increase in the future, depending on the impact of future changes in our enrollment mix, and regulatory and other factors outside our control, including, for APUS, any reduction in tuition assistance provided by DoD for service members and education benefits provided by the VA for veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90/10 Rule calculation. Currently, DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits are not treated as Title IV revenue under the 90/10 Rule and, therefore, such funding is included in the \u201c10%\u201d portion of the rule calculation. A reduction in the availability of this type of funding, or a change (through legislation, regulatory action, or an executive order) that requires that those funds be treated in the same manner as Title IV funding under the 90/10 Rule, would increase our institutions\u2019 90/10 Rule percentage. For the past three years, HCN has derived more than 80% of its total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs as calculated under ED\u2019s regulations. If HCN is unable to attract students who do not depend on Title IV program aid, such as students who finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers, or through VA benefits, HCN\u2019s 90/10 Rule percentage may increase.\nIf any of our institutions violates the 90/10 Rule and loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, it would also lose the ability to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs because DoD requires institutions to participate in the Title IV programs in order to participate in the tuition assistance programs, and ineligibility of either or both of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA failure by our institutions to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s incentive payment rule could result in sanctions.\nIf one of our institutions pays a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of the HEA\u2019s prohibition on such payments, commonly referred to as the incentive payment rule, the institution could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If ED determines that one of our institutions violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to ED\u2019s satisfaction. ED may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. ED may also seek to recover Title IV funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. In June 2015, ED announced that it will calculate institutional liability for noncompliance with the incentive payment rule by calculating the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment rule. As described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Incentive Payment Rule,\u201d changes in the interpretation of the regulation may create uncertainty about what constitutes impermissible incentive payments. Ambiguities as to how the incentive payment rule is interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain employees, and, as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe DoD MOU requires that institutions participating in the DoD tuition assistance programs have policies in place compliant with regulations issued by ED related to restrictions on payment of incentive compensation. In addition, the Improving Transparency of Education Opportunities for Veterans Acts bans incentive compensation based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid with regard to VA benefits.\nIn addition, third parties may file \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suits on behalf of the federal government under the Federal False Claims Act alleging violation of the incentive payment provision. Such suits may prompt ED investigations, and the federal government may determine to intervene in the lawsuits. Particularly in light of ED\u2019s June 2015 announcement discussed above and the uncertainty surrounding interpretation of the incentive payment rule, the existence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, qui tam or whistleblower suits or ED investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline, could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, and could impact the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, among other things. As a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their student loan default rates are too high, and our future growth could be impaired as a result.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an educational institution\u2019s federal student loan cohort default rates must remain below certain specified levels. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year. If an institution\u2019s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate. Educational institutions will lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their cohort default rate exceeds 40% for any given year or is equal to or greater than 30% for three consecutive years.\nIf one of our institutions is required to develop a formal default prevention plan, it may increase our administrative costs which would adversely impact our results of operations. In the past there has been increased attention by members of Congress and others on default prevention activities of for-profit education institutions. If such attention leads to Congressional or regulatory action restricting the types of default prevention assistance that educational institutions are permitted to provide, the default rates of our former students may be negatively impacted. Such attention could also lead to Congressional proposals to increase the measuring period, which could negatively impact our default rates. In the past, members of Congress have also introduced proposed legislation that would assess institutions a share of the costs associated with default of student loans by students who were enrolled in the institutions\u2019 education programs and would tie an institution\u2019s obligation to make such \u201crisk-sharing\u201d payments to the institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs. If one of our institutions loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, students would no longer be eligible to use Title IV program funds at that institution, which would significantly reduce that institution\u2019s enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to administer our institutions\u2019 participation in Title IV programs and their failure to perform services as agreed or to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nED\u2019s regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to ED for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. Our institutions utilize third-party servicers for some services and in the future may consider using third-party servicers for other functions that are currently managed directly by our institutions. If any third-party servicer that we have engaged does not comply with applicable statutes and regulations including the HEA, our institutions may be liable for its actions, and our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of one of our third-party servicers to perform the services as agreed may adversely impact our ability to operate, our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, and our financial condition. Further, in the event that our institutions transition to or from a third-party servicer for any of its services, there would be costs and risks related to the transition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur institutions will be subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if the Department of Education determines that our institutions failed to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion, and must return those unearned funds to the Title IV programs in a timely manner, generally within 45 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under ED regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution\u2019s annual Title IV compliance audit constitute material noncompliance for which an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit.\nHCN\u2019s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2012, identified a deficiency related to timely return of Title IV program funds. In a Final Audit Determination Letter in February 2014, ED determined that HCN was not required to repay the liability to ED and directed HCN to adopt procedures to prevent reoccurrence. However, HCN was required to post an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of approximately $130,000, which was released by ED in February 2018.\nAPUS\u2019s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2016 identified a finding related to return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly computed. In a Final Audit Determination letter dated January 29, 2018, ED conveyed its finding that funds had not been returned timely. ED also noted that a similar finding had been made in an open program review with respect to which APUS has not yet received a program review report. In connection with the finding, ED\nrequired APUS to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $700,000. APUS posted the letter of credit on March 28, 2018 and it expired December 31, 2019.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to comply with ED\u2019s substantial misrepresentation rules could result in material sanctions.\nED may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. An institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, or admissions services, makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency, or to ED.\nIf ED determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may: (i) if the institution is provisionally certified, revoke an institution\u2019s program participation agreement or impose limitations on its participation in Title IV programs; (ii) deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution; or (iii) initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. If administrative actions or litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation were brought against our institutions, we could incur legal costs related to their investigation and defense, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act as implemented by ED could result in sanctions.\nOur institutions must comply with certain campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to ED and disclose in its annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred within the institution\u2019s so-called \u201cClery geography.\u201d APUS historically has not had to comply with the Clery Act because it is a wholly online institution. As a result of opening a Veteran\u2019s Center in Charles Town, WV, APUS determined that it is no longer subject to that exclusion and issued its first annual security report in 2016. HCN publishes an annual security report as required by the Clery Act. Our institutions\u2019 failure to comply with the Clery Act requirements or regulations promulgated by ED could result in our institutions being fined or having their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, could lead to litigation, or could harm our institutions\u2019 reputation, each of which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.\nEnforcement of laws related to the accessibility of technology continues to evolve, which could result in increased information technology development costs and compliance risks.\nAPUS\u2019s educational programs are made available to students through personal computers, mobile devices and other technological devices. For each of these programs, the curriculum makes use of a combination of graphics, pictures, videos, animations, sounds, and interactive content. Federal agencies including ED and the Department of Justice have considered or are considering how electronic and information technology should be made accessible to persons with disabilities, such as in the terms of specific technical standards. For example, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or Section 504, prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance. ED\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice assert that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, ED\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has taken enforcement action against several institutions of higher education, including primarily online institutions, after determining that their websites and online learning management platforms were not accessible to persons with a disability. If one of our institutions is found to have violated Section 504, it may be required to modify existing content and functionality of its online classroom or other uses of technology, including through adoption of specific technical standards. As a result of such enforcement action or as a result of new laws and regulations that require greater accessibility or accessibility in accordance with specific technical standards, our institutions may have to modify their online classrooms and other uses of technology to satisfy applicable requirements, which could require substantial financial investment. As with all nondiscrimination laws that apply to recipients of federal financial assistance, an institution may lose access to federal financial assistance if it does not comply with Section 504 requirements. In addition, private parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits alleging failure to comply with laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and defending against such actions may require our institutions to incur costs to modify their online classrooms and other uses of technology and costs of litigation.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims, or initiate enforcement actions or litigation against us, any of which could disrupt our institutions\u2019 operations and adversely affect their performance.\nBecause our institutions operate in a highly-regulated industry, we are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of noncompliance, enforcement proceedings, and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, students, employees, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. For example, ED regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in Title IV programs and the ED OIG regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. Institutions that participate in the Title IV programs also must have an independent auditor conduct an annual audit of the institution\u2019s compliance with the laws and regulations that are applicable to the Title IV programs in which the school participates and must submit the results of the audit to ED. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has investigated and in some cases brought lawsuits against for-profit institutions alleging that the institutions engaged in deceptive trade practices, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sued for-profit institutions for engaging in allegedly illegal predatory lending practices.\nIf the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, our institutions may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions, or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. Even if our institutions adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us or one of our institutions may result in reputational damage, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit. Any one of these sanctions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our institutions, which may materially adversely affect our ability to operate.\nED is currently conducting a program review of APUS\u2019s administration of the Title IV programs, and we cannot predict the outcome of the review.\nIn September 2016, ED began a program review of APUS\u2019s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years. As part of the program review, ED conducted a site visit in September 2016. The program review remains open and ongoing. We anticipate that certain findings addressed in the 2016 Title IV compliance audit Final Audit Determination letter dated January 29, 2018 will be resolved through the program review process, including a finding that return of Title IV funds calculations were incorrectly computed for some students and a finding that APUS had incorrectly reported the students\u2019 enrollment status to the National Student Loan Data System for some students. In addition, APUS is certified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2020 and will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after that date. If the program review and any associated liabilities remain unresolved at the time ED acts on APUS\u2019s recertification application and ED decides to recertify APUS, we believe such recertification is likely to be on a provisional basis because of the unresolved program review and associated liabilities. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the program review, when it will be completed, or whether it will impose any liability or other limitations on APUS as a result of the review.\nInvestigations by state Attorneys General, Congress, and governmental agencies may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs.\nWe and other for-profit postsecondary education providers have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation in recent years. State attorneys general have increasingly focused on allegations of improper recruiting, compensation, and deceptive marketing practices, among other issues. States may also have consumer disclosure laws, including laws specifically applicable to for-profit institutions, and a state attorney general may take the position that any such laws apply to institutions that offer wholly online education to students in the state. A number of state attorneys general have launched investigations into for-profit postsecondary education institutions. In August 2017, we received from the Attorney General of Massachusetts a CID relating to an investigation of alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by American Military University in connection with the recruitment and retention of students and the financing of education. The CID required the production of documents and information relating to recruitment, enrollment, job placement and other matters. On August 6, 2018, APUS entered into an AOD to resolve the inquiry. Pursuant to the terms of the AOD, and without any finding or admission of wrongdoing on APUS\u2019s part, APUS paid $270,000 to the Attorney General and agreed to otherwise comply with applicable Massachusetts regulations. Other state attorneys general may also initiate inquiries into us or our subsidiaries. Actions by state attorneys general and other governmental agencies, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions\u2019 programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit institutions.\nOur institutions are two of a much larger number of for-profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market. Regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been brought against several for-profit educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices, and noncompliance with ED regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media and social media coverage, have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings, and have in some cases resulted in legislation or rulemaking. In some cases, institutions have ceased operations, including while under multiple government investigations. Broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector have negatively affected public perceptions of for-profit educational institutions, including our institutions, and this trend could continue or broaden. In addition, reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, Congress, and governmental agencies have led to adverse media and social media coverage of postsecondary and for-profit education. Adverse media or social media coverage regarding others in our industry, or regarding us or our institutions directly, could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments at our institutions, lower revenue and increased expenses, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. Such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by ED, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures, state attorneys general, or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including us and our institutions. For these reasons or others, not-for-profit or public educational institutions may take actions to differentiate themselves from the for-profit educational institutions, including by choosing not to enter into collaborations with for-profit institutions, including us, or by excluding for-profit institutions from membership in industry groups. Similarly, some corporations may choose not to collaborate with for-profit providers such as us for programs for their employees or for other training purposes. For example, when Walmart announced that it will not be renewing its partnership agreement with APUS, it announced a new program that only involved not-for-profit institutions.\nIf we undergo a change in ownership or control, the Department of Education will place our institutions on provisional certification, and the terms of that provisional certification could limit our institutions\u2019 potential for growth and adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, our revenue, and results of operations.\nED\u2019s regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly-traded corporation occurs if: (i) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control; or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control under this standard. Under the HEA, an institution whose parent undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility.\nFuture transactions could constitute a change in ownership or control under ED\u2019s regulations and could cause ED to place our institutions on provisional certification as required by the HEA. The conditions of provisional certification or heightened scrutiny by ED could impact, among other things, our institutions\u2019 ability to add educational programs, or additional locations, our ability to acquire other institutions, or our ability to make other significant changes. In addition, if ED were to determine that our institutions were unable to meet their responsibilities while they were provisionally-certified, ED could seek to revoke our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections than if they were fully-certified. Limitations on our institutions\u2019 operations could, and the loss of our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs would adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollments, and our revenue and results of operations.\nIf regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our Company or of institutions that we own or acquire, our and our institutions\u2019 ability to operate could be impaired.\nIf we or one of our institutions experiences a change of ownership or control under the standards of applicable state regulatory bodies, accrediting agencies, ED, or other regulators, we or the institution governed by such agencies must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution\u2019s common stock, significant changes in the composition of an institution\u2019s Board of Directors, internal restructurings, acquisitions of institutions from other owners, or certain other transactions. Some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our or our institutions\u2019 failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the relevant regulatory agencies following a transaction involving a change of ownership or control could result in a suspension of operating authority, loss of accreditation, or suspension or loss of ability to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions and our financial condition. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require our institutions to suspend activities in that state or otherwise impair our\ninstitutions\u2019 operations. The potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence, among other things, future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain contingents of Congress continue to examine the for-profit postsecondary education sector, which could result in targeted legislation, heightened oversight, or additional Department of Education rulemaking that may limit or condition Title IV program participation of for-profit schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWhile in recent years the focus of Congress on for-profit educational institutions has declined, certain contingents of Congress continue to examine institutions like ours. This focus has resulted in the introduction of various pieces of legislation, the holding of several hearings by various Congressional committees, and Congressional investigations and inquiries. We have previously incurred significant legal and other costs to respond to Congressional inquiries, and could incur significant legal and other costs to respond to any future inquiries. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and investigations will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV programs, or litigation alleging statutory violations, regulatory infractions, or common law causes of action.\nCongress currently is in the process of considering comprehensive legislation to reauthorize the HEA. We cannot predict whether, in what form, or when, the two houses of Congress will reauthorize the HEA or whether, or when, the President will sign reauthorization legislation. Amendments to the HEA could occur as part of reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.\nThe adoption of any law or regulation that reduces funding for federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our institutions or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue. Legislative action also may increase our administrative costs and require our institutions to modify their practices in order to comply with applicable requirements. Additionally, members of Congress have also from time to time encouraged ED to adopt additional regulations for participation in Title IV programs that could increase our cost of operations or expose us to additional risks.\nCongressional examination of DoD oversight of tuition assistance used for distance education and for-profit institutions could result in legislative or regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, Congress has considered various proposals that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One current proposal would decrease the limit on Title IV funds from 90% to 85% and another current proposal would maintain the 90% limit but count DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits toward that limit. Such a proposal or other similar legislation, should it become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions. In contrast, another proposal would have eliminated the 90/10 Rule. At this time we cannot predict the likelihood that Congress or the President will modify the 90/10 Rule or take some other action to limit the use of DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits at for-profit institutions. To the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition the participation of for-profit schools or distance education programs in DoD tuition assistance programs or in Title IV programs, or that limit or condition the amount of DoD tuition assistance for which for-profit schools or distance education programs are eligible to receive, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCongress has in the past changed, and may in the future change, eligibility standards and funding levels for federal student financial aid programs, DoD tuition assistance, and other programs. Other governmental or regulatory bodies may also change similar laws or regulations relating to such programs, which could adversely affect our student population, revenue, and financial condition.\nPolitical and budgetary concerns can significantly affect Title IV programs, military tuition assistance programs, and other laws and regulations governing federal and state aid programs.\nTitle IV programs are made available pursuant to the provisions of the HEA, and the HEA comes up for reauthorization by Congress approximately every five to six years. In the recent past, Congress has passed short-term non-substantive extensions of the HEA pending comprehensive reauthorization legislation. Further, when Congress does not act on comprehensive reauthorization through a single piece of legislation, it may act through multiple pieces of legislation. Congress completed the most recent reauthorization through multiple pieces of legislation and may reauthorize the HEA in a piecemeal manner in the future. Congress currently is in the process of considering legislation to reauthorize the HEA. Additionally, Congress determines the funding level for each Title IV program on an annual basis.\nFuture Congressional action, including in reauthorizations or appropriations acts, may result in numerous legislative changes, including those that could adversely affect the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, DoD tuition assistance programs, and the availability of such funding sources for our students. Members of Congress frequently propose legislation to alter or amend the terms under which our institutions participate in the federal student financial aid programs. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV programs or the ability of our institutions or students to participate in these programs could materially harm our institutions\u2019 business. A reduction in government funding levels could lead to lower enrollments at our institutions and require our institutions to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for their students. Lower student enrollments at our institutions or their students\u2019 inability to arrange alternative sources of funding could adversely affect our financial condition. Congressional action may also require our institutions to modify their practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory expenses.\nWe are not in a position to predict whether any legislation will be passed by Congress or signed into law in the future. The reallocation of funding among Title IV programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different Title IV programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institutions and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nRecent and future regulatory developments may adversely impact our institutions\u2019 enrollment, financial condition, results of operations, expenses, and cash flows.\nED has in the past published and in the future may publish additional rules that affect our institutions. For example, on October 15, 2018, ED published in the Federal Register a notice of its intent to establish the Accreditation and Innovation Committee, including three subcommittees, to prepare proposed regulations on several topics related to the Title IV programs. In April 2019, the Accreditation and Innovation Committee reached consensus on the package of proposed regulatory language. Subsequently, ED has issued proposed and, in some cases, final rules related to the topics addressed by that committee. For more information about the rulemaking processes currently underway, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Regulatory Activity - Federal Rulemakings.\u201d\nIn addition to publishing rules, ED has in the past and may in the future take other actions that affect our institutions. For example, in September 2015, ED publicly released its \u201cCollege Scorecard\u201d website, as discussed in more detail in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - College Scorecard.\u201d Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. In May 2019, ED updated the College Scorecard to include additional information, including program-level outcomes data such as earnings and loan debt, and in November 2019 ED supplemented the College Scorecard to include program-level outcomes data such as median earnings and median loan debt. We cannot determine the extent to which data collected and published by ED has impacted or may impact our institution\u2019s enrollments, reputation, or operating results, including if students exclude our institutions from consideration because of the College Scorecard\u2019s presentation of our graduation rate, the focus on tax status and our status as a for-profit business, or because of other factors.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future rulemakings, actions, or interpretations that may be implemented or adopted by ED. However, these and future regulatory developments may adversely impact our institutions\u2019 enrollments, financial condition, results of operations, expenses, and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with the various federal and state laws and regulations governing HCN\u2019s recently launched program to extend credit to its students could subject us to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans and other injunctive requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nIn July 2018, HCN began offering extended payment plan options, and beginning with enrollments for the term beginning in January 2020, HCN added an additional extended payment program. The extended payment plan options are designed to assist students with educational costs consisting of tuition, textbooks, and fees. Payment plans require monthly payments while the student is enrolled in a program and extend for a period up to six months after the last day of attendance or graduation. The extended payment plans are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, such as the Truth in Lending Act as implemented in Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as implemented in Regulation B, and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. For more on these extended payment plan options and their regulation, see \u201cOur Institutions - Hondros College of Nursing - Sources of Student Financing\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations / Requirements - Additional Sources of Student Payments\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. We have limited experience in extending credit to our students and therefore in complying with these laws and regulations. If we do not comply with laws and regulations applicable to this financing\nprogram, we could be subject to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans and other injunctive requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain or renew licenses, approvals or accreditation and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDoD\u2019s MOU includes terms and conditions that impose extensive regulatory requirements on our institutions with respect to participation in DoD tuition assistance programs.\nEach institution participating in DoD tuition assistance programs is required to sign an MOU outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to accepting funds from DoD tuition assistance programs. In 2014, DoD promulgated new regulations and institutions were required to sign a new MOU, which we refer to as the DoD MOU, in order to continue to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. For more information about the requirements imposed by the DoD MOU, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Department of Defense.\u201d We cannot predict precisely what type of immediate sanctions, if any, will be implemented before an institution loses the ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs for failure to comply with the DoD MOU. We believe that DoD may also impose sanctions other than denying an institution the ability to participate in tuition assistance programs, including restricting student enrollment in tuition assistance programs, suspending an institution from enrolling new students, limiting access to military installations, subjecting the institution to heightened compliance oversight, or otherwise limiting an institution\u2019s ability to participate in tuition assistance programs. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the DoD MOU or any successor MOU, we will not be able to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs, which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid.\nWe collected a substantial portion of our fiscal year 2019 consolidated revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds. Any processing disruptions by ED, by our institutions, or by third-party service providers may impact the ability of our institutions\u2019 students to obtain Title IV financial aid on a timely basis. If our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid, either because of administrative challenges on their part or the part of their vendors, or the inability of ED to process Title IV funds on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 business and on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid because of administrative challenges on their part or the part of their vendors, ED could require that our institutions become subject to payment methods for Title IV programs that are not the advance payment system, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 cash flows.\nWe have recently implemented a shared services model for services between APEI and APUS, and APEI and HCN, and challenges encountered due to the implementation of this model may cause strategic or operational challenges and adversely impact us.\nBeginning in 2016, we began to invest capital and human resources in the transition and planned implementation of the shared services model pursuant to which APEI will provide services to APUS and HCN that were previously handled directly within APUS and HCN, as well as in changes to our systems and training of employees, among other things. We also separated the roles of President of APUS and CEO of APEI, although subsequently our CEO, Dr. Wallace E. Boston, resumed both positions until a new CEO of APEI was appointed effective September 23, 2019. In December 2016, APUS submitted a change of structure application to HLC in connection with the proposed implementation of the shared services model.\nIn November 2018, HLC notified APUS that the HLC Board of Trustees approved the change in structure application and extended APUS\u2019s accreditation following adoption of the shared services model, which we subsequently implemented. As required by HLC policy and ED regulation, HLC conducted a focused site visit in May 2019. The site visit team found that evidence of compliance with the commitments APUS made in its application and with HLC\u2019s Eligibility Requirements and Criteria for Accreditation was sufficiently demonstrated and no further follow up was recommended. In August 2019, HLC notified APUS that HLC\u2019s Institutional Actions Council, which conducts reviews and takes action on accreditation recommendations, concurred with the site visit team\u2019s findings.\nAs with any operational change, the implementation of the shared services model, and the evaluation and implementation of any leadership changes, could lead to strategic and operational challenges, distractions of management from other key initiatives, inefficiencies, or increased costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEfforts to diversify our business outside of the traditional areas served by our institutions may provide strategic and operational challenges that we are not prepared or able to address.\nWe intend to continue to explore opportunities to invest in the education industry, which could include purchasing or investing in other education-related companies or companies developing new technologies. As we seek opportunities to expand our business and serve markets beyond those traditionally served by our institutions, we may encounter strategic and operational challenges different from those within our existing institutions. Our institutions may have limited experience operating in new businesses and markets or new modes of teaching (such as CBE, micro-credentials, or other non-degree credentials) and may need to modify systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other institutions and organizations. In addition, our systems and infrastructure may not be able to respond quickly enough to support new business opportunities, or we may not otherwise be able to address the strategic or operational differences of these new opportunities. If we are unable to successfully capitalize on new opportunities, the value of our common stock may decline over time, including because of the challenges of growing our core business under our current model.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and may enter into or seek to enter into, business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, or divert management attention.\nWe may seek to enter into business combinations or acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties consolidating operations and integrating information technology and other systems, as well as the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations during the acquisition and integration processes;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval of the acquisition from the necessary regulatory agencies, or the imposition of operating restrictions or a letter of credit requirement on us or on the acquired institution;\n\u2022\nchallenges relating to conforming non-compliant financial reporting procedures to those required of a subsidiary of a U.S. reporting company, including procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.\nAny inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, many acquisitions result in the acquirer recording goodwill. If any acquisitions for which we record goodwill are not successful or experience challenges, that goodwill may become impaired and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, we recorded pretax, non-cash charges of $7.3 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill as a result of determinations that the fair value of HCN was less than its carrying value because of circumstances including HCN\u2019s underperformance against 2019 internal targets and overall 2019 financial performance. We also previously recorded a charge in 2016 to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill as a result of a determination that the fair value of HCN was less than its carrying value.\nOur acquisition of an educational institution would also likely be considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards, as in the HCN acquisition. For such an acquisition, we may need approval from ED, applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies, and possibly other regulatory bodies, a number of which can only be requested after completion of the acquisition. Our inability to obtain such approvals with respect to a completed acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a productive result. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of securities or could require use of substantial portions of our available cash, as in the HCN acquisition, or issuances of debt, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have limited experience in making investments in other entities, and any such investments may not result in strategic benefits for our business or could expose us to other risks.\nTo assist us in achieving elements of our business strategy or to further develop our business capabilities, from time to time we will consider and may pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. These transactions could include, among other things, investments in, partnerships or joint ventures with, or the acquisition of, other schools, service providers or education technology related companies, among other types of entities. Investing in another entity requires expertise in evaluating another entity\u2019s business and identifying strategic benefits of a potential investment in such entity, among other expertise. These types of investments involve significant challenges and risks, including that the investment does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we acquire unknown liabilities, or that management\u2019s attention is diverted from our core business. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition. Any investments in other entities may also subject us to the operating and financial risks of such entities, and we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of such entities.\nWe have made minority investments in entities in which we do not have sole control, which present risks in addition to those that apply to other investments or acquisitions. These investments include our investment in a holding company that acquired and now operates New Horizons Worldwide, Inc., or New Horizons, our investment in preferred stock of Fidelis Education, Inc., or Fidelis Education, our investment in preferred stock of Second Avenue Software, Inc., or Second Avenue, and our investment in preferred stock of RallyPoint, an online social network for members of the military. Although we have the right to representation on the Board of Directors of the holding company of New Horizons, the Board of Directors of Fidelis Education, and the Board of Directors of Second Avenue, and have observer rights for the Board of Directors of RallyPoint, we do not have the ability to control the policies, management or affairs of these entities, and generally we would not have that ability in any minority investment in an entity. The interests of persons who control the entities in which we have invested and may invest may differ from our interests, and they may cause such entities to take actions that are not in our best interest, and we may become involved in disputes with such persons. Our inability to control entities in which we make minority investments could negatively affect our ability to realize the strategic benefits of those investments.\nWe have made these minority investments to realize strategic benefits for our business, rather than to generate income or capital gains from these investments, and we may make future minority investments for similar purposes. We cannot ensure that we will realize any strategic benefits from these investments in the near-term or at all. To the extent that the strategic benefits of any investment are not timely realized, or the investment otherwise underperforms, we may wish to dispose of the investment. Because our interests in entities in which we have made minority investments, such as New Horizons, Fidelis Education, Second Avenue, and RallyPoint are highly illiquid and not traded in any public market, we may not be able to timely dispose of these interests, or may have to sell at less than our carrying value. Further, should the value of these investments become impaired, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of these investments. For example, we recorded a non-cash, pretax impairment charge of $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, to reduce the carrying value of certain minority investments to their fair value.\nOur inability to dispose of our interest in such an entity, or a reduction in the carrying value of such an entity on our books, would negatively affect our operating results.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage and limit our exposure to bad debt.\nWe experienced an increase in bad debt in our HCN segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 and have experienced increases in other recent interim periods in both our HCN and APUS segments. We believe these increases in bad debt in our HCN segment have been primarily driven by HCN\u2019s implementation of extended payment plan options in 2018. For more information on the extended payment plan options, see \u201cOur Institutions - Hondros College of Nursing - Sources of Student Financing\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations / Requirements - Additional Sources of Student Payments\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nWe also experienced increases in our bad debt expense over several years prior to 2015, particularly at APUS. We believe those increases were primarily driven by an increase in the number of students using Title IV program funds, operational policies, processing challenges, and challenges collecting funds primarily related to students who did not complete courses. In September 2015, APUS changed the method by which it disburses Title IV program funds in an effort to lower bad debt expense and to reduce the attractiveness of our programs to students who are seeking to abuse the Title IV programs. While we have experienced decreases in bad debt expense at APUS during each of the last several years, there is no assurance that these changes caused the reductions.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to limit our exposure to bad debt or that steps we take to limit bad debt will be effective. Continued bad debt increases in our HCN segment or bad debt expense increases at APUS could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party vendors whose service may be of lower quality than ours, whose responsiveness may be less timely than ours, and whose compliance practices may increase our operational and compliance risk.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide certain services to our institutions and their students primarily related to information technology services and financial aid processing, and expect to rely more heavily on such vendors, particularly through cloud computing services, for certain information technology services in the future. While we monitor and assess the service of these vendors, it is possible that the quality of their service and the timeliness of their responses may be less than the service and responsiveness that we or our institutions would provide. These third-party vendors may lack adequate business continuity planning. Using third-party vendors increases compliance risk that the vendors may not adequately protect personal information regarding our institutions\u2019 students and their families, or that they may not comply with applicable federal or state regulations applicable to our institutions\u2019 business. Further, transitioning from existing vendors or from in-house processes to new providers or from third-party providers to in-house processes involves inherent risks, including the risk of significant disruptions of integral processes. In the event third-party vendors fail to provide services, lack adequate continuity planning, or fail to provide necessary implementation or transition services, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our institutions may lose the ability to participate in Title IV programs or Department of Defense tuition assistance programs, or have participation in these programs conditioned or limited.\nOur institutions, in particular APUS, have been the target of fraudulent and abusive activity related to Title IV program funds, as well as other fraudulent or abusive activities. We believe the risk of outside parties attempting to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds at APUS, including as a result of identity theft, is heightened due to its being an exclusively online education provider and its relatively low tuition. Our institutions must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid. We cannot be certain that our institutions\u2019 systems and processes will continue to be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with the changing nature of these fraud schemes.\nED requires institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the ED OIG credible information about fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs, and in the past our institutions have referred to the OIG information with respect to potential fraud by applicants and students. If the systems and processes that our institutions have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, ED may find that our institutions do not satisfy ED\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. If our institutions fail to satisfy the administrative capability requirements, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer our institutions from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to heightened cash monitoring status, or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment, place our institutions on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate our institutions\u2019 participation in Title IV programs, which would adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, revenue, and results of operations. In addition, our institutions\u2019 ability to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs is conditioned on maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by ED. Any significant failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause our institutions to fail to meet their accreditors\u2019 standards. Furthermore, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering online programs, like APUS\u2019s programs, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for such a program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to meet the requirements of our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies could result in the loss of accreditation of one or more of our institutions, which could result in their loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, DoD tuition assistance programs, or both.\nWe may have unanticipated tax liabilities that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our institutions are subject to multiple types of taxes in the U.S. and may be subject to taxation in the future in various foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax accruals involves various estimates and judgments, and therefore the ultimate tax determination is subject to uncertainty. In addition, changes in tax laws, regulations, or rules, or application of state sales taxes, may adversely affect our future reported financial results, may impact the way in which we conduct our business, or may increase the risk of audit by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities. Although we believe our tax accruals are reasonable, the final determination of tax returns under review or returns that may be reviewed in the future and any related litigation could result in tax liabilities that materially differ from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, an increasing number of states are adopting new laws or changing their interpretation of existing laws regarding the apportionment factors used for state corporate income tax purposes in a manner that could result in a larger proportion of our income being taxed by the states in which we are required to file state tax returns. These legislative and administrative changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and certain investments.\nWe rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and certain investments and generate all of our operating income through our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and investments. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to us depends on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory requirements such as obligations to maintain certain restricted cash or post letters of credit, accreditation requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries, and the covenants of any future obligations that we or our subsidiaries may incur.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed, and changes in management could cause disruption and uncertainty.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. While we have employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, the President of APUS, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Technology Officer, we do not have employment agreements with other executives or personnel, and the employment agreements that we do have do not prevent our executives from voluntarily ceasing to work for us.\nWe must attract and retain diverse and highly qualified management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel to our institutions. Competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas, and executives with relevant industry expertise. We have had a number of other executive officers retire or otherwise depart our Company over the last several years and we continually evaluate our leadership structure. For instance, effective October 15, 2017, Dr. Karan Powell retired from her role as President of APUS. Dr. Boston, who was at the time our Chief Executive Officer, was appointed to serve as Interim President of APUS, and since August 2018 has served as President of APUS on a permanent basis. In September 2019, Angela Selden was hired as our Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Boston remained in the role of President of APUS pending his expected retirement in June 2020. In addition, in May 2018, we hired a new Chief Technology Officer, and in May 2019, we appointed a new interim Chief Executive Officer of HCN, replacing the former Chief Executive Officer of HCN. In addition to these hires and changes, we are also seeking a successor to Dr. Boston as President of APUS, and may otherwise continue to work to strengthen our management team. As with any leadership changes, our past or future changes could lead to strategic and operational challenges and uncertainties, distractions of management from other key initiatives, inefficiencies, or increased costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to attract new management, faculty, administrators, or skilled personnel or fail to retain, develop, and motivate our existing management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel, our institutions and our ability to serve our students and expand our programs, open new locations, make investments or acquisitions, and update or enhance our technology could be severely harmed, and changes in management could disrupt our business and cause uncertainty.\nOur success depends on the contributions of our approximately 2,900 employees.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents, experience, and efforts of our employees, and we believe that we can be distinguished by our ability to foster a culture and practice of innovation, quality, communication, cooperation, honesty, and respect. In addition, our strategic initiatives require our management, faculty, staff, and skilled personnel to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. Our failure to maintain a positive culture or to continue fostering the growth and development of our personnel, including through the use of staff performance evaluation systems and processes, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on key personnel to lead with integrity. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values, we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our culture.\nWe also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. While we have processes in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel, or transfer knowledge, could significantly impact our business and results of operations.\nOur limited ability to obtain exclusive proprietary rights and protect our intellectual property, as well as disputes we may encounter from time to time with third parties regarding our use of their intellectual property, could harm our operations and prospects.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our institutions develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and other registrations. Our institutions rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content experts.\nWe cannot ensure that any measures we and our institutions take to protect our intellectual property or obtain rights to the intellectual property of others will be adequate, or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our institutions\u2019 proprietary rights in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate the proprietary rights of our institutions. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or copy aspects of our institutions\u2019 curriculum, online resource material, quality management, and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our institutions\u2019 business. Protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our institutions\u2019 competitors of competing courses and programs.\nOur institutions may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against our institutions alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for our institutions to conduct operations in such a way as to avoid disputes regarding those intellectual property rights. Any such dispute could subject our institutions to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether that dispute has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and our institutions may be required to alter the content of their courses or pay monetary damages, which may be significant.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of course materials posted online for course discussions.\nIn some instances, our institutions\u2019 faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content online in course discussion boards or in other venues. The laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional policies governing these practices. We and our institutions may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online. Third parties may raise claims against us and our institutions for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us and our institutions to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our institutions\u2019 faculty members or students could also post classified material on course discussion boards, which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our institutions\u2019 reputations and relationships with members of the military and government. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages and our institutions may be required to alter the content of their courses.\nLegal proceedings, particularly class action lawsuits, may require human and financial resources, distract our management, and negatively affect our reputation and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we and our institutions have been and may be involved in various legal proceedings. In recent years, we have observed an increase in litigation brought against for-profit schools, including class actions brought by students and prospective students based on alleged misrepresentations about a school\u2019s programs, an increase in \u201cqui tam\u201d lawsuits, and investigations by state attorneys general into for-profit postsecondary education institutions, which are described above under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry.\u201d For example, in November 2013, a putative class action was brought against HCN relating to a time period prior to our ownership. The lawsuit asserted claims for fraud and fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied-in-fact contract, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. While HCN admitted to no wrongdoing in the eventual settlement agreement and the case was dismissed with prejudice after the payment of a de minimis settlement, on December 4, 2015, ED sent HCN a letter informing HCN that ED had determined to fine HCN $27,500 based on ED\u2019s finding that HCN had substantially misrepresented its programmatic accreditation status during a time period prior to our ownership of HCN. HCN informed ED in a letter that it disagreed with ED\u2019s findings but would pay the fine in order to resolve promptly the matter and to enable ED to finalize its review of the application for a change in ownership. In the future, not all claims may be as easily resolved. The significant human and financial resources required to investigate and respond to claims brought in any future\nlitigation may distract management\u2019s attention from operating our business or lead to larger payments or liabilities, including adverse regulatory action, and, as a result, negatively affect our operating results.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds will be available on acceptable terms.\nWe may need additional capital in the future for various reasons, including to finance business acquisitions and investments in technology or to achieve growth or fund other business initiatives, but there is no assurance that capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Additionally, any securities issued to raise capital may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate capital is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, our and our institutions\u2019 ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures, will be limited.\nOur access to capital markets and sourcing for additional funding to expand or operate our business is subject to market conditions. Credit concerns regarding the for-profit postsecondary education industry as a whole also may impede our access to capital markets. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may have to limit strategic initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEconomic and market conditions, including changes in interest rates, could affect our enrollments, success with placement and persistence and cohort default rates in the U.S. or abroad.\nOur business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by a general economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or abroad. Our institutions derive a significant portion of their revenue from Title IV programs, which include student loans with interest rates subsidized by the federal government. Additionally, some students finance their education through private loans that are not government subsidized. Historically low interest rates have created a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, our students may have to pay higher interest rates on their Title IV program loans and private loans as a result of recent interest rate increases. Increases in applicable interest rates could result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to our existing and prospective students, which could result in a reduction in our enrollment. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to our students\u2019 repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our eligibility to participate in some Title IV programs, which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nAdverse economic developments that affect the United States could also result in a reduction in the number of jobs available to our graduates and lower salaries being offered in connection with available employment, which, in turn, could result in declines in our success with placements and persistence. In addition, adverse economic developments could adversely affect the ability or willingness of our former students to repay student loans, which could increase our institutions\u2019 student loan cohort default rates and require increased time, attention, and resources to manage these defaults. Our institutions\u2019 students are able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition and fees. The excess is received by such students as a credit balance refund. However, if a student withdraws, our institutions must return any unearned Title IV funds, which may include a portion of the credit balance refund, and must seek to collect from the student any resulting amounts owed to the institution. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students\u2019 ability to satisfy debts to the institution, including debts that result from returns of unearned Title IV amounts. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without repayment from our institutions\u2019 students could increase, and our financial results could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Technology Infrastructure\nWe need to continue to invest, and may need to increase our level of investment in, our institutions\u2019 information technology, which may place a strain on resources that could adversely affect our systems, controls, and operating efficiency, and those of our institutions.\nWe need to invest capital, time, and resources to update our institutions\u2019 information technology, including our student-facing systems, in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace, including data analytics, artificial intelligence, interactive and immersive user and learning experience technologies such as those that leverage virtual and augmented reality, multi-channel customer engagement, and robotic process automation, to update or replace older systems, and to enhance functionality. We incurred approximately $2.1 million during 2019 to evaluate and invest in replacements or upgrades to our information technology systems, including our learning management system, and to inform the scope and duration of our larger overall information technology transformation program. We also anticipate spending between approximately $6.0 million and $8.0 million in 2020, focusing on specific information technology projects, including replacements of our learning management and customer relationship management systems. While we estimate 80% of this anticipated spending to be one-time spending with respect to the projects and systems to which the expenditures relate, we expect to make similar expenditures in future years,\nbut we have not estimated any future amounts at this time. We would likely also have to make investments to integrate the technology systems of any business we may acquire in the future. Our efforts to improve our information technology systems may not be successful, may cost more than expected, may increase our level of spending, not all of which can be capitalized, or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. We may also be unable to address all of the initiatives that we would like to pursue, or find that the number of projects we are working on impacts our ability to adequately address critical areas. As a result of unsuccessful development efforts, or as a result of replacing outdated technology, software or other technology related assets, we may have assets that become impaired. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pretax, non-cash charge of $5.1 million in long-lived assets, primarily consisting of a loss that resulted from the abandonment of development of a new student course registration system.\nIf we are unable to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 technology resources or update their resources appropriately, their ability to handle future growth, to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, even if we are able to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 resources and update their resources appropriately, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by an increased level of spending.\nSystem disruptions to our online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructure and systems of third parties, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and could damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe performance and reliability of our and our institutions\u2019 networks and technology infrastructure, including those of third parties systems we use, is critical to our institutions\u2019 reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could interrupt our or our institutions\u2019 ability to operate and could result in the unavailability of APUS\u2019 online classrooms, preventing students from accessing their courses and adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, our institutions\u2019 technology infrastructure, and the technology infrastructure of our third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist activities, and telecommunications failures.\nOur systems at APUS, particularly those proprietary information systems and processes that we refer to as Partnership at a DistanceTM, or PAD, have been predominantly developed in-house, with limited support from outside vendors. To the extent that we have utilized third-party vendors to provide certain software products for our systems, we have generally needed to integrate those products into, and ensure that they function with, PAD. We continuously work on upgrades to PAD, and our employees devote substantial time to its development and to the successful integration of third-party products into PAD. To the extent that we face system disruptions or malfunctions with PAD or lose employees with experience on our systems, we may not have the capacity to address such disruptions or malfunctions or to continue to administer PAD with our internal resources, and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system.\nWe also use third party services such as cloud computing and software as a service for certain aspects of our operations and are reliant on the capabilities of vendors for such functions. We expect to increasingly rely on cloud computing and software as a service providers for our information technology operations in the future. Cloud computing and third party service providers may take actions beyond our control that could adversely affect our access to the provider\u2019s service, including discontinuing or limiting our access to its platform or modifying or interpreting its terms of service or other policies in a manner that impacts our ability to run our business and operations. In addition, any transition of cloud computing and third party services that we use to another vendor could be difficult to implement and cause us to incur significant time and expense. Any significant downtime or other interruption or disruption of these services could adversely impact our operations and our business.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of our institutions\u2019 data centers or server rooms or those of our third party service providers could cause a loss of data. Even with redundancy, a significant interruption in the operation of these facilities or the loss of institutional and operational data due to a natural disaster, fire, power interruption, act of terrorism, or other unanticipated catastrophic event may not be preventable. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by the failure to successfully expand or upgrade systems, or to manage transitions and implementations, could reduce the ability to manage network and technological infrastructure, which could adversely affect our institutions\u2019 operations and reputations. Additionally, our institutions do not necessarily control the operation of the facilities hosting our technology infrastructure and may be required to rely on other parties to provide physical security, facilities management, and communications infrastructure services. If any third party vendors encounter financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that causes them to fail to adequately secure and maintain their facilities or provide necessary connectivity or capacity, our institutions and their students may experience interruptions in service or the loss or theft of important data, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nData security breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise sensitive information and cause system disruptions and significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain on our network systems, and on the networks of our third-party providers, certain information that is confidential, proprietary, personal (such as student information), or otherwise sensitive in nature, including financial information and confidential business information. Our computer networks, and the networks of our third-party vendors, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or disruptions by computer hackers, phishing, ransom-ware, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering and other security attacks or security problems. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information or personal information about our students or employees, or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. Our systems and the systems maintained by our third-party providers, have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access, breach or other system disruptions. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and the damage caused thereby. If we or third parties with access to our systems, or to our proprietary information or personal information about our students or employees, experience security breaches in the future, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, which could include litigation brought by affected individuals or other parties, the impositions of penalties, disruption to our operations, and damage to our reputation. Our planned increased use and reliance on cloud computing could expose us to additional risks. While our contractual arrangements with cloud computing vendors provide for the protection of information, we cannot control these vendors or their systems and cannot guarantee that a data security or privacy breach of their systems will not occur in the future.\nWe use external vendors to perform security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess our information security. We utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are adequately monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure. However, we cannot ensure that these security assessments and audits will protect our computer networks against the threat of security breaches. Similarly, although we require our third-party vendors to maintain a level of security that is acceptable to us and work closely with our third-party vendors to address potential and actual security concerns and attacks, we cannot ensure that we and our systems and proprietary information or personal information about our students or employees will be protected against the threat of security attacks on our third-party vendors that affect our systems or such information. System disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructures and systems of third parties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our institutions\u2019 operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our institutions or, in some cases, certain third-party vendors hired by our institutions, collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information and personal and family financial data. Our institutions also collect and maintain personal information of employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain third-party vendors, including our third-party servicers and information technology vendors. Although our institutions use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use, or transmission of personal information or intentional or unintentional misuse could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our institutions\u2019 operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could restrict the use of personal information and require notification of data breaches. We cannot guarantee that a breach, loss, or theft of personal information will not occur. A violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines or lawsuits against us or our institutions. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen safeguards will protect against security threats to our systems, data, and business. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our institutions\u2019 students and their families or our institutions\u2019 employees or other data that is held by our institutions or third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 reputations and results of operations and result in legal actions by regulators, state attorneys general, and private litigants, any of which actions could divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face an ever-increasing number of threats to our computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, malicious penetration, system viruses, ransomware, phishing and other malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our systems. These risks increase when we make changes to our information technology systems or implement new ones. Our size makes us a prominent target for hacking and other cyber-attacks within the education industry. From time to time we experience security events and incidents, and these reflect an increasing level of malicious sophistication, organization, and innovation. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats and may subsequently be deemed to have been inadequate by regulators or courts given the lack of prescriptive measures in data security and cybersecurity laws. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations, perhaps over an extended period of time prior to detection. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of or alleviate problems caused by these system disruptions and security breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nVarious federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, and security of student and consumer data. These laws could be applied in a manner that results in costs, the imposition of fines and operational conditions on our business. For example, if an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Failure to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements may result in FTC enforcement, which could include the imposition of conditions, penalties, monitoring, and oversight. In addition, this area of the law is evolving, and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations differ. In addition, in the U.S., Congress and many state legislatures are considering legislation relating to privacy and security of personal information as are other countries. These evolving laws and interpretations are difficult to predict and could impact our business. Legislative activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are relevant to us and the operations of our institutions, for example, restricting use or sharing of consumer data, including for marketing or advertising, and may lead to increases in the cost of compliance. For example, the CCPA became effective January 1, 2020 and contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents, affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information and provides a private right to action for certain data breaches. In addition, our institutions may be subject to the GDPR, which contains a number of requirements that may apply when they collect or otherwise handle personal information about individuals in the EU. These laws\u2019 applicability to us could result in substantial compliance costs or liabilities. The GDPR came into effect in May 2018, but enforcement priorities and interpretation of certain provisions remain unclear. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine for certain activities of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of an organization\u2019s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, per violation. Claims of failure to comply with our institutions\u2019 privacy policies or applicable laws or regulations could form the basis of governmental or private-party actions against us. Such claims and actions may cause damage to our institutions\u2019 reputation and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The enactment of laws similar to the GDPR or CCPA, or any future changes in such laws or additional restrictions, could result in significant costs and require us to change some of our business practices.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow. The increasing reliance on and use of the internet and other online services has led and may continue to lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, cybersecurity, internet neutrality, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices, and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs of compliance or doing business and materially affect our institutions\u2019 ability to offer online courses, which would have a material effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.\nOur stock has had relatively limited public float, and trading in our common stock has also been limited and, at times, volatile. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings, our institutions\u2019 net course registrations or enrollments, or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in the political environment, government policies, laws and regulations, or similar changes made by accrediting bodies;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u2022\nactions of others in our industry.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and monetary damages and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our institutions\u2019 enrollments and associated expenses. The student population at our institutions varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, increased military operations and deployments, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns at our institutions and related fluctuations in expenses. These fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations, have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, or both.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price or trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We previously were covered by more analysts, but we currently only have limited research coverage by analysts, which makes it more difficult to attract interest from investors. Furthermore, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business, or our stock performance, or if our performance does not meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts covering us cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change of control of our Company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, and rights of each series without stockholder approval, which may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Company;\n\u2022\na requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of their intention to nominate a director or to propose any other business at an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition against stockholder action by means of written consent unless otherwise approved by our Board of Directors in advance; and\n\u2022\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 92428, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "APEI"}
