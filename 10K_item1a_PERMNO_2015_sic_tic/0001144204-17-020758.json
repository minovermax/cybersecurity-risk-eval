{"cik": "1674227", "company": "Alliance MMA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business represents a new business model for the MMA industry.\nOur business model focuses on creating a developmental feeder organization for the UFC and other premier MMA promotions by combining many leading regional MMA promotions under one umbrella organization. Our business model is unique to the MMA industry and may not prove to be successful. We have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business. Although each of the Initial Business Units has operated independently, in some cases for many years, they commenced combined operations following the closing of our IPO on September 30, 2016 and the integration of those businesses by Alliance. The MMA industry is also rapidly growing and evolving and may develop in a way that is detrimental to our business model. You must consider the challenges, risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies using new and unproven business models in new and rapidly evolving markets. Some of these challenges relate to our ability to:\n\u00b7 establish or increase our brand name recognition;\n\u00b7 continue to acquire prominent regional MMA promotions;\n\u00b7 ability to integrate acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 expand our popularity and fan base;\n\u00b7 successfully produce live events;\n\u00b7 manage existing relationships with broadcast television outlets and create new relationships to broadcast and distribute our televised content domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7 develop sponsorship, advertising, licensing and branding activities; and\n\u00b7 create new outlets for our content and new marketing opportunities.\nOur business strategy may not successfully address these and the other challenges, risks and uncertainties that we face, which could adversely affect our overall success and delay or prevent us from achieving profitability.\nWe may be perceived as a competitive threat to the UFC and to other premier MMA promotions that may use their significantly greater resources to frustrate our business and growth strategy.\nIt is our intention to serve as a developmental organization for the UFC and other premier national MMA promotions in the same fashion as college athletic programs serve as \u201cfeeders\u201d to professional sports leagues. Although we do not intend to compete with these promotions, since we will promote live events, televise and distribute MMA media and related content, solicit sponsorship revenues and seek to secure professional MMA fighters to multi-fight contracts, we may be perceived as a competitor by these organizations. Should the UFC or another premier national MMA promotion view us as a competitive threat they could use their significantly greater resources to frustrate our business and growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our business.\nA future decline in the popularity of mixed martial arts could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are affected by consumer tastes and sports and entertainment trends, which are unpredictable and subject to change, and may be affected by changes in the social and political climate. We believe that MMA is growing in popularity in the United States and around the world, but a change in our fans\u2019 tastes or a material change in the perceptions of the MMA industry, whether due to social or political issues or otherwise, could adversely affect our operating results and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key professional MMA fighters.\nOur business is dependent upon identifying, recruiting and retaining highly regarded professional MMA fighters for our promotions. Fans and sponsors are attracted to events featuring top fighters, and the value placed on a promotion\u2019s television and other media rights is dependent to a great extent on the quality of the promotion\u2019s fighter roster. We may not be able to attract and retain key professional MMA fighters due to competition with other regional promoters for the same fighters. Failing to put on events featuring top professional fighters could adversely affect our operating results and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to attract national promotional and advertising sponsorships or maintain such arrangements.\nOur business strategy involves developing national sponsorship arrangements, or expanding existing regional sponsorship arrangements, in support of our network of live MMA events. We will compete with larger more established sports and entertainment organizations and media outlets for sponsorship and advertising revenue. While many of our Initial Business Units have existing local and regional sponsorship arrangements with large advertisers who advertise on a national basis in our target markets and demographic, they currently have no national sponsorships. Should we be able to secure national promotional and advertising arrangements following the proposed acquisition, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain these arrangements. Many factors, including the popularity and perception of MMA and the perceived quality of our promotions, will significantly affect our ability to secure and maintain important advertising and promotional arrangements. If we are unable to generate sponsorship and promotional revenue and increase that revenue over time, our operating results and business will be adversely affected.\nThe economic uncertainty impacts our business and financial results and a renewed recession could materially affect us in the future.\nAny significant decrease in consumer confidence, or periods of economic slowdown or recession, could lead to a curtailing of discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our revenues and results of operations and adversely affect our financial position. Our business will be dependent upon consumer discretionary spending and therefore will be affected by consumer confidence as well as the future performance of the United States and global economies. As a result, our results of operations will be susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. Increases in job losses, home foreclosures, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies, credit card debt and home mortgage and other borrowing costs, declines in housing values and reduced access to credit, among other factors, may result in lower levels of ticket sales, sponsorship and distribution revenue.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, and the loss of these executives could materially harm our business and our strategic direction if we were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Danner, our Chief Financial Officer, John Price and our President, Robert Haydak. We have employment agreements with all members of senior management, however, we cannot prevent members of senior management from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of members of senior management could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities. We have not purchased life insurance covering any members of our senior management.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence.\nFor our live and television audiences, we will face competition from, in addition to other MMA promotions, professional and college sports, as well as from other forms of live and televised entertainment and other leisure activities that are offered in a rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented marketplace. Many of the companies with which we will compete have greater financial resources than are available to us. Our failure to compete effectively could result in a significant loss of viewers, venues, distribution channels or athletes and fewer advertising dollars spent on our form of sporting events, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with the area, different rules and regulations and challenging operating environments.\nSome of our future acquisitions may be located in geographic areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause future promotions to be less successful than our existing promotions. Acquisitions in new markets may not generate the same level of revenues and may have higher operating expense ratios than the Initial Business Units\u2019 promotions.\nSome of our future acquisitions may occur outside the United States. Beyond the risks posed by new markets generally, the operating conditions in overseas markets may vary significantly from those our current promotions experienced in the past, including in relation to consumer preferences, regulatory environment, currency risk, the presence and cooperation of suitable local partners and availability of vendors or commercial and physical infrastructure, among others. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these acquisitions into our operations, achieving market acceptance, operating these acquisitions profitably, and maintaining compliance with the rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements of new markets. Our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to obtain and maintain key agreements and arrangements with television and other media outlets could adversely affect our ability to distribute our original MMA programming.\nOur business strategy is dependent upon monetizing the media content we intend to create at our live MMA events through live television and cable broadcasts and the distribution of live and historical video content through a variety of media outlets such as Internet pay-per-view and video on demand. We also anticipate that our growth will be dependent on securing international distribution arrangements for our content. There is significant competition for television and other distribution arrangements from within the MMA industry and from other sports and entertainment companies who offer these media outlets programming alternatives to our MMA content. Our failure to obtain and maintain key agreements and arrangements with television and other media outlets could adversely affect our ability to distribute our original MMA programming, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur limited operating history makes forecasting our revenues and expenses difficult.\nAs a result of our limited operating history as a combined business, it is difficult to forecast accurately our future revenues. Current and future expense levels are based on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues after we achieve the anticipated synergies of combining the Initial Business Units\u2019 businesses into one company. Revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on our ability to promote events, secure national sponsorships and advertising arrangements for our regional promotions, and enter into television and media distribution arrangements. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending appropriately to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may result in substantial losses and a lower market price for our common stock.\nIf we do not manage our growth effectively, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur expansion strategy includes the acquisition of additional regional MMA promotion companies and organic growth. These acquisitions may not be indicative of our ability to identify, secure and manage future acquisitions successfully. The acquisition of our current promotions or any future businesses may require a greater than anticipated investment of operational and financial resources as we seek to institute uniform standards and controls across promotions. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of management and resources, increases in administrative costs, including those relating to the assimilation of new employees, and costs associated with any debt or equity financings undertaken in connection with such acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any acquisition we undertake, including the acquisition of the Initial Business Units or Iron Tiger, will be successful. Future growth will also place additional demands on our management, sales, and marketing resources, and may require us to hire and train additional employees. We will need to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our growth, and we may not have the resources to do so in the time frames required. The failure to manage our growth effectively will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to implement our strategy of acquiring additional companies and such acquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks.\nWe anticipate making future acquisitions of regional MMA promotions in markets that we do not serve now. We may not be able to reach agreements with such promotions on favorable terms or at all. In completing the acquisition of promotions, we rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each acquisition as well as our own due diligence investigation. We cannot assure you that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that our due diligence will uncover all materially adverse facts relating to the operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their businesses. To the extent that we are required to pay for undisclosed obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, we may not realize the expected economic benefit from such acquisition and our ability to seek legal recourse from the seller may be limited.\nFuture acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of indebtedness and increased amortization expense.\nFuture acquisitions will likely result in issuances of equity securities, which may be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders, the incurrence of debt, which will require us to maintain cash flows sufficient to make payments of principal and interest, the assumption of known and unknown liabilities, and the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nIn order for us to grow and successfully execute our business plan, we may require additional financing which may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms. If such financing is available, it may be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders. Failure to obtain financing may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and our ability to grow our business.\nThere has been limited trading in our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will either develop or be maintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to enter the market periodically in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or appreciate over time. Because we intend to acquire additional regional MMA promotion businesses primarily using our common stock as purchase consideration, fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may make such acquisitions more difficult to consummate or may make them more dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 changes in the MMA industry;\n\u00b7 our ability to secure sponsorships and distribution arrangements for our content;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments; and\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe periodic availability of shares for sale upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d, in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nInvestor relations activities, nominal \u201cfloat\u201d and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.\nWe expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to generate investor awareness. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described. We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings, social media and email campaigns that are produced by third parties based upon publicly-available information concerning us. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts\u2019 reports or other materials based upon analysts\u2019 own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. In addition, investors may, from time to time, also take steps to encourage investor awareness through similar activities that may be undertaken at the expense of the investors. Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may adversely affect the trading market our common stock.\nWe may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events if we do not comply with applicable regulations.\nIn various states in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies will require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for athletes and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the revenue streams generated from our live events, in which case our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe could incur substantial liability in the event of accidents or injuries occurring during our events.\nWe intend to hold numerous live MMA events each year. Each live event will expose our employees who are involved in the production of those events to the risk of travel and match-related accidents, the costs of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The physical nature of our events will expose our professional MMA fighters to the risk of serious injury or death. Although our fighters, as independent contractors, are responsible for maintaining their own health, disability and life insurance, we insure medical costs for injuries that a fighter may suffer at our events. Any liability we incur as a result of the death of or a serious injury sustained by one of our fighters while fighting in a match at our events, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur live events will entail other risks inherent in public live events, including air and land travel interruption or accidents, the spread of illness, injuries resulting from building problems, equipment malfunction, terrorism or other violence, local labor strikes and other \u201cforce majeure\u201d type events. These circumstances could result in personal injuries or deaths, canceled events and other disruptions to our business for which we do not carry business interruption insurance, or result in liability to third parties for which we may not have insurance. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, particularly rights to our video fight libraries. We have an application pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to register \u201cAlliance MMA\u201d as a trademark and maintain a catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights covering television programming and photographs. Our inability to protect our portfolio of copyrighted material, trade names and other intellectual property rights from infringement, piracy, counterfeiting or other unauthorized use could negatively affect our business. We have received an initial office action from the USPTO contesting our application to register the Alliance MMA name on the basis that the name appears descriptive. We are contesting this initial office action and believe we will ultimately prevail in securing a registration, although there can be no assurance we will. If we fail to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose an important advantage in the market in which we compete. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to help us maintain our position in the market and our competitive advantages. Monitoring unauthorized uses of and enforcing our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly. Legal intellectual property actions are inherently uncertain and may not be successful, and may require a substantial amount of resources and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the laws, regulations and other requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to these laws could have a material adverse impact on the revenue, profit or the operation of our business.\nIn addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by Congress and state legislatures, may have an adverse effect on our business. The Affordable Care Act assesses penalties on employers who do not offer health insurance meeting certain affordability or benefit coverage requirements. While we believe our plans will meet these requirements, changes to the law or the payment of penalties if the specified level of coverage is not provided at an affordable cost to employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce accurate and complete financial reports and to help prevent financial fraud. In addition, such control is required in order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls or fail to correct deficiencies in our controls noted by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, we could fail to meet our obligations to report our operating results accurately and completely, and our continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market could be jeopardized.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or security breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various information technology systems and data centers, including our ticketing system, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Disruptions in these systems could have an adverse impact on our operations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in our business operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of infiltration or data theft. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect or prevent over long periods of time. Moreover, the hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud or deception aimed at our employees, contractors or temporary staff. In the event that the security of our information systems is compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated and system disruptions could occur. Any such misappropriation or disruption could cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe believe we maintain insurance coverage that is customary for businesses of our size and type; however, we may be unable to insure against certain types of losses or claims, or the cost of such insurance may be prohibitive. For example, although we carry insurance for breaches of our computer network security, there can be no assurance that such insurance will cover all potential losses or claims or that the dollar limits of such insurance will be sufficient to provide full coverage against all losses or claims. Uninsured losses or claims, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16376, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "WORX"}
