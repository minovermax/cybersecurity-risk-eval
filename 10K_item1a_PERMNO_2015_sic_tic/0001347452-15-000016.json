{"cik": "1347452", "company": "Andalay Solar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and information we provide in our press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected financial performance, operations and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our expectations. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. The factors underlying our forecasts and forward-looking statements are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe will need additional capital in the near future to fund our business, and financing may not be available. If we can find financing our common stock may be greatly diluted. If we cannot find financing to fund the business, we may decide or may be forced to reorganize or to wind down operations.\nWe expect our currently available capital resources and cash flows from operations to be insufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Our cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the amount of our sales, the timing and levels of products purchased, pricing, payment terms and credit limits from manufacturers, the availability and terms of asset-based credit facilities, the timing and level of our accounts receivable collections, and our ability to manage our business towards profitability.\nWe expect to need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or enter into new asset-based or other credit facilities, but such financings will likely dilute our stockholders. The December Equity Purchase Agreement that we entered into with Southridge Partners II, LP (\u201cSouthridge\u201d) on December 10, 2014 contains conditions that must be met prior to funding and therefore there can be no assurance that such conditions will be met when funding is needed. We cannot assure you that any additional financing that we may need will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our loss of S-3 eligibility in September 2012 due to our Nasdaq delisting and limited availability of authorized and unissued common stock may make it more difficult to raise such funds. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities, develop new products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures. If we are not able to raise additional capital, and if we are not able to significantly increase our revenues from operations, we will not have enough funds to continue operations and we may either decide to or may be forced to reorganize or to wind down our operations. If such event were to occur, any equity holdings in the Company would likely be reduced to zero.\nWe have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting procedures which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis.\nIn connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting process and procedures for the year ended December 31, 2014. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" under Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have determined that further improvements are required in our accounting processes before we can consider the material weakness remediated. Management's procedures and testing identified errors that, although not material to the consolidated financial statements, led management to conclude that control deficiencies exist related to various financial disclosures, including derivative valuation and warranty reserves. As a result of these deficiencies, it is reasonably possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not have prevented or detected errors from occurring that could have been material, either individually or in the aggregate.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. While we have taken actions to improve our internal controls in response to the identified material weakness related to certain aspects of our accounting process and procedures, additional work will be needed to address and remediate the identified material weakness. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, securities litigation, and/or lack of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects.\nOur loan and security agreement was exchanged for a convertible note, but both the agreement and the convertible note contain many negative covenants and if we trigger those covenants under the agreement we could lose all of our assets.\nOur loan and security agreement with Lender and Collateral Services, LLC is secured by all of our assets. The agreement and the convertible note which now evidences the loan contain both affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants regarding incurrence of indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, subject to materiality and other qualifications and exceptions customary for a credit facility of this size and type. Our obligations under the agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, which includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-defaults related to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to certain other matters, and loss of perfected lien status. If we fail to comply with these covenants or if we fail to make certain payments under the secured loans when due, the Lender could declare our loans in default. If we default on the loan, the Lender has the right to seize our assets that secure the loan, which may force us to suspend all operations.\nWe have a history of losses and there can be no assurance that we will generate or sustain positive earnings.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a net loss of $1.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. We cannot be certain that our business strategy will ever be successful. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with any emerging business operations. If we fail to address any of these risks or difficulties adequately, our business will likely suffer. Future revenues and profits, if any, will depend upon various factors, including the success, if any, of our expansion plans, marketability of our instruments and services, our ability to maintain favorable relations with manufacturers and customers, and general economic conditions. There is no assurance that we can operate profitably or that we will successfully implement our plans. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate positive earnings.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.\nOur significant operating losses, negative cash flow from operations, and challenges in rapidly securing alternative sources of supply for solar panels, raise substantial uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty, and contemplate the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report included herein. If we cannot generate the required revenues and gross margin to achieve profitability or obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we will need to substantially revise our business plan or cease operations and an investor could suffer the loss of a significant portion or all of his investment in our company. As a result of our delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market in September 2012, we are no longer eligible to file new registration statements on Form S-3, which may make it more costly and more difficult for us to obtain additional equity financing. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings, if any, for development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe are dependent upon our solar panel suppliers for regular shipments of products; however we have not been timely in payment to them in recent periods, which has resulted in disruption in our supply of products. If we do not quickly establish replacement sources of supply, our operations will be further adversely affected.\nHistorically, we obtained virtually all of our solar panels from Suntech and Lightway. During 2012, because of our cash position and liquidity constraints, we were late in making payments to both of these suppliers. On March 30, 2012, pursuant to our Supply Agreement with Lightway, we issued 1,900,000 shares of our common stock to Lightway in partial payment of our past due account payable to them. At the time of issuance, the shares were valued at $1,045,000. On May 1, 2012, Suntech filed a complaint for breach of contract, goods sold and delivered, account stated and open account against us in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco. Suntech alleged that it delivered products and did not receive full payment from us. On July 31, 2012, we and Suntech entered into a settlement of this dispute. Because of our inability to make scheduled settlement payments, on March 15, 2013, Suntech entered a judgment against us in the amount of $946,438. As of December 31, 2014, Suntech has not sought to enforce its judgment. As of December 31, 2014, we have included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets a balance due to Suntech America of $946,438. We currently have no unshipped orders from Suntech or Lightway.\nIn September 2013, we entered into a second supply agreement for assembly of our proprietary modules with Tianwei New Energy Co, Ltd., (\u201cTianwei\u201d) a panel supplier located in China. We began receiving product from Tianwei in February 2014 and stopped as of June 2014. In July 2014, we entered into a supply agreement for assembly of our proprietary modules with Auxin Solar, Inc., a panel supplier located in the United States. We began receiving product from Auxin in December 2014. Although we believe we can find alternative suppliers for solar panels manufactured to our specifications, our operations would be disrupted unless we are able to rapidly secure alternative sources of supply, our inventory and revenue could diminish significantly, causing disruption to our operations.\nWe are dependent upon our key suppliers for the components used in our systems and we must arrange for cost competitive manufacturing of our proprietary solar panels in order to grow our business.\nHistorically, we obtained virtually all of our components from suppliers in China. These components are specifically manufactured for our patented technology, and we are dependent on these suppliers to provide us with high quality low cost manufactured goods. If these suppliers stopped providing these materials to us, we may have a difficult time in sourcing high quality replacement vendors.\nIt is critical to the growth of our revenue that our products be high quality while offered at competitive pricing. We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to obtain and maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products. Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to maintain favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions. If we fail to negotiate better terms and maintain our relationships with our current suppliers or develop new supplier relationships, we may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which could adversely affect or limit our sales and growth.\nWe are currently subject to market prices for the components that we purchase, which are subject to fluctuation beyond our control. An increase in the price of components used in our systems could result in an increase in costs to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and demand for our products.\nInterruptions in our ability to procure needed components for our systems, whether due to discontinuance by our suppliers, delays or failures in delivery, shortages caused by inadequate production capacity or unavailability, financial failure, manufacturing quality, or for other reasons, would adversely affect or limit our sales and growth. There is no assurance that we will continue to find qualified manufacturers on acceptable terms and, if we do, there can be no assurance that product quality will continue to be acceptable, which could lead to a loss of sales and revenues.\nThe U.S. Government imposed tariffs on solar panels manufactured in China causing the prices we pay for solar panels to increase. This could cause customer demand for our products to decrease.\nIn early 2012, a group of solar panel manufacturers with domestic U.S. production facilities requested the U.S. Government to impose tariffs on the import of solar panels manufactured in China, based on allegations of unfair competition and of subsidization of prices for Chinese-made solar panels by the Chinese Government.\nOn December 31, 2013, SolarWorld America Industries, Inc. requested the U.S. Government to impose tariffs on the import of solar panels manufactured in China with Taiwanese solar cells, based on allegations of unfair competition and of subsidization of prices by the Chinese Government. In December 2014, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that imports of Chinese panels made with Taiwanese solar cells injure the domestic manufacturing industry. The Commerce Department has found for the complainant in all of the cases, imposing tariffs on Chinese manufacturers of solar panels and tariffs on solar panels made with Taiwanese solar cells.\nOur historical solar panel suppliers, Suntech and Lightway, both manufactured panels for us in China, and we anticipate that we may continue to purchase at least a portion of our solar modules from Chinese manufacturers. The imposition of tariffs on these modules may cause prices to rise, which would generally increase the price of solar power systems, and which may cause a reduction in demand.\nWe have experienced significant customer concentration in recent periods, and our revenue levels could be adversely affected if any significant customer fails to purchase products from us at anticipated levels.\nThe relative magnitude and the mix of revenue from our largest customers have varied significantly quarter to quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2014, five customers have accounted for significant revenues, varying by period, to our company: Smart Energy Today (\u201cSmart Energy\u201d), which specializes in helping home owners and business owners become more energy efficient, WDC Solar, Inc. (\u201cWDC\u201d), a leading construction, integration and installation of commercial, residential and utility scale solar installations in the Washington D.C. area, JCF Wholesale (\u201cJCF\u201d) a provider of residential and commercial electrical services in Southern California, Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. (Lowe\u2019s), a nationwide home improvement retail chain, and Sustainable Environmental Enterprises (\u201cSEE\u201d), a leading provider of renewable energy and development projects located in New Orleans, Louisiana. If we were to lose one of these companies as a customer, our revenue would decrease and our company may be materially harmed.\nWe are continuing to shift our business model, away from manufacturing and towards design and installation. We had previously exited the installation business, and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in returning to that business.\nOur shift to focus on a design and installation business model will depend, in large part, on our ability to successfully expand our distribution channels to include authorized dealers in California, as well as elsewhere in North America, and to accelerate the growth of our design and installation business. California is the largest state in the country for solar products, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the U.S. market. Therefore, we continue to pursue developing distribution channel partners in California and North America, as well as installation opportunities in California.\nIf we are not able to achieve the expansion of our design and installation business and meet our revenue growth and cost reduction objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our change in strategic focus and our restructuring may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nSpecifically, risks in the operations of our business in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the change to a design and installation business model include, among other things:\nIn addition, the shift(s) in our business model(s) may result in additional or unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated cost reduction benefits may not be realized.\nOur technology may encounter unexpected problems or may not be protectable, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur technology is relatively new and has not been tested in installation settings for a sufficient period of time to prove its long-term effectiveness and benefits. Problems may occur with products or their underlying components that are unexpected and could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We have been issued several U.S. and foreign patents that cover our Andalay solar panel technology. We have several other pending patent applications covering Andalay technology. Ultimately, we may not be able to realize the benefits from any patent that is issued.\nBecause our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry, we may lose market share to larger companies that are better equipped to weather a decline in market conditions due to increased competition.\nOur industry is highly competitive and fragmented, is subject to rapid change and has low barriers to entry. Competition in the solar power services industry may increase in the future, partly due to low barriers to entry, as well as from other alternative energy sources now in existence or developed in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share and greater competition for qualified technical personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to compete effectively, or if competition results in a deterioration of market conditions, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur profitability depends, in part, on our success and brand recognition and we could lose our competitive advantage if we are not able to protect our trademarks and patents against infringement, and any related litigation could be time-consuming and costly.\nWe have registered the \u201cAndalay Solar\u201d trademark with the USPTO related to our panel technology. Use of our trademarks or similar trademarks by competitors in geographic areas in which we have not yet operated could adversely affect our ability to use or gain protection for our brand in those markets, which could weaken our brand and harm our business and competitive position. In addition, any litigation relating to protecting our trademarks and patents against infringement could be time consuming and costly.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with global economy, which increase the uncertainty of project financing for solar installations and the risk of non-payment from customers.\nThe continuing tight credit markets are contributing to an ongoing slowdown in the solar industry, which may worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further. The market for installation of solar power systems depends largely on commercial and consumer capital spending. Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in these areas of spending, and may cause customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders, which may reduce our net sales. Difficulties in obtaining capital and adverse market conditions may also lead to the inability of some customers to obtain affordable financing, including traditional project financing and tax-incentive based financing and home equity based financing, resulting in lower sales to potential customers with liquidity issues, and may lead to an increase of incidents where our customers are unwilling or unable to pay for systems they purchase, and additional bad debt expense for us. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions make it challenging for us to obtain equity and debt financing to meet our working capital requirements to support our business, forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may have warranty obligations to Real Goods Solar, Inc. that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with our exit from the solar system installation business in California in 2010, Real Goods Solar, Inc. (\u201cReal Goods\u201d) agreed to undertake primary, \u201cfirst responder\u201d responsibility for future warranty service obligations relating to the approximately 800 installations for SunRun that we have previously completed (the \u201cAndalay Installations\u201d). We retain secondary warranty responsibility on the Andalay Installations, in the event that Real Goods fails to perform the warranty. We will reimburse Real Goods for actual warranty service work completed by Real Goods related to these \u201cfirst responder\u201d installations. Other than solar panels and inverters that are covered under the manufacturer warranty, we provided our customers for Andalay Installations a 5-year or a 10-year warranty. We have accrued, and included within \u201cAccrued Warranty\u201d in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, a liability of approximately $568,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, to cover these warranty obligations. That amount is intended to cover both the Andalay Installations and certain installation projects assigned to Real Goods. The terms of the Warranty Agreements provided that we establish an escrow account as a source of funds from which to satisfy our obligation to pay Real Goods for its fees and reimburse it for its expenses for warranty work performed by it pursuant to the Warranty Agreements which are not paid to Real Goods from the company directly. In March 2011, we entered into an Escrow Agreement with Real Goods and deposited $200,000 into an escrow fund. The amount is reflected in long-term assets of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets. In November 2014, Real Goods returned $110,000 of the escrow amount. If Real Goods fails to perform under the assigned warranty coverage, or the actual warranty expenses exceed the amounts we have accrued, we could incur significant unexpected additional expenses, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends on our key personnel, including our executive officers, and the loss of key personnel or the transition of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, could disrupt our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key sales, marketing and operations personnel. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. We may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify, hire and integrate new personnel; and we do not have key person insurance policies in place for these employees. Starting on May 7, 2012, Margaret Randazzo, acted as our Chief Financial Officer, a director, and our Chief Executive Officer. On April 22, 2014, Steven Chan assumed the role as our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer and President after Ms. Randazzo announced her resignation as our Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial Officer effective June 30, 2014. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find a suitable candidate to fill the role of a permanent Chief Financial Officer or that there will be a smooth transition. Changes in our key positions can be disruptive and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain highly qualified personnel, the quality of our services may decline and we may not successfully execute our internal growth strategies.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to continue to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, including technical personnel. Qualified technical employees periodically are in great demand and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements. While we currently have available technical expertise sufficient for the requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional highly skilled technical personnel. We expect competition for such personnel to increase as the market for solar power systems expands.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled technical employees in the future including a successor CFO. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates of compensation could impair our ability to secure and complete customer engagements and could harm our business.\nUnexpected warranty expenses or service claims could reduce our profits.\nWe maintain a warranty reserve on our balance sheet for potential warranty or service claims that could occur in the future. This reserve is adjusted based on our ongoing operating experience with equipment and installations. It is possible, perhaps due to bad supplier material or defective installations, that we would have actual expenses substantially in excess of the reserves we maintain. Our failure to accurately predict future warranty claims could result in unexpected profit volatility.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY\nWe have experienced technological changes in our industry. New technologies may prove inappropriate and result in liability to us or may not gain market acceptance by our customers.\nThe solar power industry (and the alternative energy industry, in general) is subject to technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to appropriately respond to changing technologies and changes in function of products and quality. If we adopt products and technologies that are not attractive to consumers, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining a significant share of our market. In addition, some new technologies are relatively untested and unperfected and may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may cause us to lose money.\nA drop in the retail price of conventional energy or non-solar alternative energy sources may negatively impact our profitability.\nWe believe that an end customer\u2019s decision to purchase or install solar power capabilities is primarily driven by the cost and return on investment resulting from solar power systems. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the prices of conventional and non-solar alternative energy sources, such as decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels, could cause the demand for solar power systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our profitability. Changes in utility electric rates or net metering policies could also have a negative effect on our business.\nExisting regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services.\nNew government regulations or utility policies pertaining to solar power systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems and our services. For example, there currently exist metering caps in certain jurisdictions which effectively limit the aggregate amount of power that may be sold by solar power generators into the power grid.\nOur business depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives; reduction, elimination or uncertainty of which would reduce the demand for our products and services.\nMany states offer incentives to offset the cost of solar power systems. These systems can take many forms, including direct rebates, state tax credits, system performance payments and Renewable Energy Credits (\u201cRECs\u201d). Moreover, the federal government currently offers a 30% tax credit for the installation of solar power systems. Businesses may also elect to accelerate the depreciation on their system over five years. Uncertainty about the introduction of, reduction in or elimination of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in significant reductions in demand for our services, which would negatively impact our sales.\nIf solar power technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or sufficient demand for solar power products does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our sales would decline and we would be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving, and its future success is uncertain. Many factors will influence the widespread adoption of solar power technology and demand for solar power products, including:\nIf solar power technology proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for solar power products fails to develop sufficiently, we would be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and sustain profitability. In addition, demand for solar power products in the markets and geographic regions we target may not develop or may develop more slowly than we anticipate.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe were delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and there is a limited trading volume for our common stock on the OTCQB.\nIn September 2012, our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our common stock, which currently trades on the OTCQB, does not have substantial trading volume. As a result, relatively small trades of our common stock may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock and, therefore, may contribute to the price volatility of our common stock. Because of the limited trading volume in our common stock and the price volatility of our common stock, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock when you desire or at the price you desire. The inability to sell your shares in a declining market because of such illiquidity or at a price you desire may substantially increase your risk of loss.\nIn addition, the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market has materially adversely affected our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all and could adversely affect institutional investor interest and we anticipate that this situation will continue into the future.\nOn each of August 30, 2013 and November 25, 2013, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Alpha Capital Anstalt relating to the sale and issuance of a convertible note in the principal amount of $200,000 that matures August 29, 2015 and November 25, 2015, respectively, and is convertible into shares of our common stock, at any time after issuance, at the option of the purchaser, at a conversion price equal to $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment upon the happening of certain events, including stock dividends, stock splits and the issuance of common stock equivalents at a price below the conversion price. On December 19, 2013, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Alpha Capital Anstalt relating to the sale and issuance of a (i) convertible note in the principal amount of $250,000 that matures December 19, 2015, and is convertible into shares of our common stock, at any time after issuance, at the option of the purchaser, at a conversion price equal to $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment upon the happening of certain events and (ii) five-year warrant exercisable for 6,250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment upon the happening of certain events.\nOn December 10, 2014, we entered into the December Equity Purchase Agreement with Southridge which superseded a prior agreement we had entered into with Southridge on January 23, 2014 pursuant to which we issued 35,000,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $684,000. Pursuant to the December Equity Purchase Agreement, Southridge has committed to purchase up to $5,000,000 worth of our common stock, over a period of time terminating on the earlier of: (i) 18 months from the effective date of the registration statement to be filed by us for the December Equity Purchase Agreement; or (ii) the date on which Southridge has purchased an aggregate maximum purchase price of $5,000,000 pursuant to the December Equity Purchase Agreement; Southridge\u2019s commitment to purchase our common stock is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, limitations based on the trading volume of our common stock.\nOn January 27, 2014, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with the Alpha Capital Anstalt relating to the sale and issuance of a convertible note in the principal amount of $100,000 that matures January 27, 2016 and is convertible into shares of our common stock, at any time after issuance, at the option of the purchaser, at a conversion price equal to $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment upon the happening of certain events. On February 25, 2014, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Alpha Capital Anstalt relating to the sale and issuance of a (i) convertible note in the principal amount of $200,000 that matures February 25, 2016 and is convertible into shares of our common stock, at any time after issuance, at the option of the purchaser, at a conversion price equal to $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment upon the happening of certain events and (ii) five-year warrant (with a cashless exercise feature under certain circumstances) to purchase 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.02 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. On March 18, 2014, we issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement we entered into with Alpha Capital Anstalt on February 25, 2014 a (i) convertible note in the principal amount of $300,000 that matures March 18, 2016 and (ii) five -year warrant (with a cashless exercise feature under certain circumstances) to purchase 7,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $.02 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.\nWhen the investors convert our convertible notes or exercise the warrant, our stockholders may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their common stock. In addition, the sale or availability for sale of the underlying shares or shares sold pursuant to the December Equity Purchase Agreement in the marketplace could depress our stock price. As a result, the investors could resell the underlying shares immediately upon issuance, which may result in significant downward pressure on the market price of our stock.\nIf we fail to meet the new eligibility requirements of the OTC Market Group, we will no longer be eligible to have our common stock quoted on the OTCQB\nIf we fail to maintain a minimum bid price of $0.01 per share one day per each thirty consecutive days, our stock will no longer be eligible to be traded on the OTCQB and will be traded on the pink sheets. Effective May 1, 2014, the OTC Market Group implemented new eligibility standards for companies traded on the OTCQB that will be gradually phased in over a one year period. Investors of companies that do not meet the eligibility requirements will not have the benefit of the additional disclosure requirements of the OTCQB and trading may be more difficult.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of April 10, 2015, we had 398,153,951 shares of common stock outstanding and we had warrants to purchase 22,148,045 shares of common stock and options to purchase 37,034,483 shares of common stock outstanding.\nAll of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding vested options will be freely tradable without restriction under the federal securities laws unless purchased by our affiliates.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock is a penny stock and therefore may be less attractive to investors.\nOur stock is considered to be a penny stock. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.\nThe broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY\nOur financial condition does not currently allow for the growth needed to maintain our strategy of licensing solar power systems and re-entering the residential solar installation business.\nOur cash on hand and receivables due to us, along with our current expenses, do not permit capital expenditure into the strategic areas of growth in which we believe we need to invest in in order to increase revenue and target towards profitability. If we are not able to increase our revenue and eventually attain profitability, we will run short of funds and may decide to or may be forced to discontinue our operations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, which impose additional burdens on us.\nWe are a public reporting company and, accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a public company, these rules and regulations result in increased compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of new series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of new series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOur recent increase in our authorized shares of common stock and our issuances of convertible notes could result in future dilution of our common stock.\nIf we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. In addition, holders of our convertible notes have the right to convert their notes into shares of our Common Stock, subject to a blocker of 9.99% of our outstanding common stock which will result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the increase in our number of authorized shares of common stock to 500,000,000 in September 2013 allows us to issue many more shares of common stock.\nFuture issuances of common shares may be adversely affected by the Equity Line.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of issuances and sales by us, including pursuant to the Equity Line under the December Equity Purchase Agreement, or sales by our existing shareholders, of common stock, or the perception that these issuances and sales could occur. Sales by our shareholders might also make it more difficult for us to issue and sell common stock at a time and price that we deem appropriate. It is likely that the sale of shares by Southridge will depress the market price of our common stock.\nDraw downs under the December Equity Purchase Agreement may cause dilution to existing shareholders.\nUnder the terms of the December Equity Purchase Agreement, Southridge has committed to purchase up to $5,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock. From time to time during the term of the December Equity Purchase Agreement, and at our sole discretion, we may present Southridge with a Draw Down Notice requiring Southridge to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase price to be paid by Southridge will be 90% of the average of the daily VWAP during the Valuation Period. On the date the Draw Down Notice is delivered to Southridge, we are required to deliver an estimated amount of shares to Southridge\u2019s brokerage account equal to 125% of the Draw Down Amount indicated in the Draw Down Notice divided by the closing bid price of the trading day immediately prior to the date of the Draw Down Notice (\u201cEstimated Shares\u201d). The Valuation Period will begin the first trading day after the Estimated Shares have been delivered to Southridge\u2019s brokerage account and have been cleared for trading and terminate on the tenth day thereafter. At the end of the Valuation Period, if the number of Estimated Shares delivered to Southridge is greater than the shares issuable pursuant to a Draw Down, then Southridge is required to return to us the difference between the Estimated Shares and the actual number of shares issuable pursuant to the Draw Down. If the number of Estimated Shares is less than the shares issuable under the Draw Down, then we are required to issue additional shares to Southridge equal to the difference; provided that the number of shares to be purchased by Southridge may not exceed the number of shares that, when added to the number of shares of our common stock then beneficially owned by Southridge, would exceed 9.99% of our shares of common stock outstanding. As a result, our existing shareholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any of the shares by Southridge. The issue and sale of the shares under the December Equity Purchase Agreement may also have an adverse effect on the market price of the common shares. Southridge may resell some, if not all, of the shares that we issue to it under the December Equity Purchase Agreement and such sales could cause the market price of the common stock to decline significantly. To the extent of any such decline, any subsequent puts would require us to issue and sell a greater number of shares to Southridge in exchange for each dollar of the put amount. Under these circumstances, the existing shareholders of our company will experience greater dilution. The effect of this dilution may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to decrease further, both because of the downward pressure on the stock price that would be caused by a large number of sales of our shares into the public market by Southridge, and because our existing stockholders may disagree with a decision to sell shares to Southridge at a time when our stock price is low, and may in response decide to sell additional shares, further decreasing our stock price. If we draw down amounts under the Equity Line when our share price is decreasing, we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount of funding.\nThere is no guarantee that we will satisfy the conditions to the December Equity Purchase Agreement.\nAlthough the December Equity Purchase Agreement provides that we can require Southridge to purchase, at our discretion, up to $5,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock in the aggregate, there can be no assurances given that we will be able to satisfy the closing conditions applicable for each put. Further, there are limitations on the number of shares in that each draw down amount is limited to the lowest closing bid price during the Valuation Period, subject to the floor. In addition, the number of shares to be purchased by Southridge may not exceed the number of shares that, when added to the number of shares of our common stock then beneficially owned by Southridge, would exceed 9.99% of our shares of common stock outstanding. Other conditions include requiring that the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part remains effective at all times during the term of the December Equity Purchase Agreement, that there is no material adverse change to our business on the date of delivery of a Draw Down Notice and that our common stock continues to trade of the OTCQB. If we fail to satisfy the applicable closing conditions, we will not be able to sell the put shares to Southridge.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to fully utilize the Equity Line.\nThere are limitations on the number of put shares that may be sold in each put. The number of put shares that Southridge shall be obligated to purchase in a given put shall not exceed the number of shares that, when added to the number of shares of our common stock then beneficially owned by Southridge, would exceed 9.99% of our shares of common stock outstanding. Thus, our ability to access the bulk of the funds available under the December Equity Purchase Agreement depends in part on Southridge\u2019s resale of stock purchased from us in prior puts. If with regard to a particular put, the share volume limitation is reached, we will not be able to sell the proposed put shares to Southridge. Accordingly, the Equity Line may not be available at any given time to satisfy our funding needs.\nSales of put shares under the December Equity Purchase Agreement could result in the possibility of short sales.\nAlthough Southridge has agreed not to enter into any \u201cshort sale\u201d (as such term is defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO of the Exchange Act), of our common stock, the sale after delivery of a put notice of such number of shares of common stock reasonably expected to be purchased under a put notice is not deemed a \u201cshort sale.\u201d Accordingly, Southridge may enter into sales or other arrangements it deems appropriate with respect to shares of our common stock after it receives a put notice under the December Equity Purchase Agreement so long as such sales or arrangements do not involve more than the number of put shares expected to be purchased under the applicable put notice. Any downward pressure on the market price of our common stock due to the issue and sale of common stock under the Equity Line could encourage short sales. If the market price of our common stock decreases during the put period it will reduce the amount paid by Southridge for the put shares. In a short sale, a prospective seller borrows common shares from a shareholder or broker and sells the borrowed common shares. The prospective seller hopes that the common share market price will decline, at which time the seller can purchase common shares at a lower price for delivery back to the lender. The seller profits when the common share market price declines because it is purchasing common shares at a price lower than the sale price of the borrowed common shares. Such sales could place downward pressure on the market price of the common stock by increasing the number of common shares being sold, which could further contribute to any decline of the market price of the common shares.\nThere is uncertainty as to number of subscription shares and the amount Southridge will pay for the put shares.\nThe actual number of shares we will issue in any particular put or in total under the December Equity Purchase Agreement is uncertain. Subject to certain limitations in the December Equity Purchase Agreement, we have the discretion to give a put notice at any time throughout the term. The number of shares we must issue after giving a put notice will fluctuate based on the market price of the common shares during the put pricing period. Southridge will receive more shares if the market price of our common stock declines. Since the price per share of each put share will fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock during the put pricing period, the actual amount Southridge will pay for the put shares included in any particular put will decrease if the market price of our common stock declines. We submitted various take-down requests during the first quarter of 2015 pursuant to the terms of the December Equity Purchase Agreement. As of April 10, 2015, 53,781,201 shares had been sold at an average price of $0.013 per share, resulting in total proceeds of approximately $780,000.", "PERMNO": 92295, "SIC": 3620, "TIC": "WEST"}
