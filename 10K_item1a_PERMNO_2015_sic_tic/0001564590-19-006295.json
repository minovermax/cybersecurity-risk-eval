{"cik": "902791", "company": "BARRETT BUSINESS SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information contained in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur consolidated retention for workers' compensation claims is $5.0 million per occurrence under our insurance arrangement with Chubb in the majority of states in which we operate.\nWe maintain our consolidated retention at $5.0 million per occurrence, except in Maryland and Colorado where our retention is at $1.0 million and $2.0 million per occurrence, respectively, due to regulatory requirements. The Company maintains its excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage with Chubb through our AICE subsidiary. Additionally, Ecole\u2019s retention is at $5.0 million per occurrence for coverage in Arizona and Utah. Thus, the Company has financial risk for most workers' compensation claims under $5.0 million on a per occurrence basis. This level of per occurrence retention may result in higher workers\u2019 compensation costs to us with a corresponding negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAdverse developments in the market for excess workers' compensation insurance could lead to increases in our costs.\nTo manage our financial exposure in the event of catastrophic injuries or fatalities, we maintain excess workers' compensation insurance. Changes in the market for excess workers' compensation insurance may lead to limited availability of such coverage, additional increases in our insurance costs or further increases in the amount for which we retain financial risk, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to continue our business operations under our present service model is dependent on maintaining workers' compensation insurance coverage.\nOur arrangement with Chubb to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage to BBSI\u2019s PEO clients in California, Delaware, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, West Virginia, Idaho, Nevada and the District of Columbia extends through June 30, 2019, with the possibility of additional annual renewals. If Chubb is unwilling or unable to renew our arrangement in the future, we would need to seek alternative coverage. If replacement coverage were unavailable or available only on significantly less favorable terms, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to manage the severity and frequency of workplace injuries will increase our workers\u2019 compensation expenses.\nSignificant increases in the relative frequency or severity of workplace injuries due to failures to accurately assess potential risks or assure implementation of effective safety measures by our clients may result in increased workers\u2019 compensation claims expenses, with a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n- 9 -\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market and credit risks, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe seek to hold a diversified portfolio of high-quality investments that is managed by a professional investment advisory firm in accordance with our investment policy and routinely reviewed by management and approved by our risk management committee. However, our investments are subject to general economic conditions and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities, including credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. Our portfolio consists primarily of debt securities and is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities. Although our investment strategy is designed to preserve our capital, we cannot be certain that our investment objectives will be achieved, and we could incur substantial realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods.\nWe may be unable to draw on our revolving credit facility in the future.\nAs discussed in more detail in \u201cNote 6 - Revolving Credit Facility and Long-Term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements incorporated into Item 8 of Part II of this report, our Credit Agreement with our principal bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \u201cBank\u201d), which expires July 1, 2020, provides for a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $28.0 million at December 31, 2018, to be used to finance working capital. There was no outstanding balance at that date. The Credit Agreement includes a standby letter of credit agreement providing for a sublimit of approximately $7.5 million in unsecured letters of credit, as well as a mortgage loan with a balance of approximately $4.2 million secured by our company office building in Vancouver, Washington.\nIf our business does not perform as expected, including if we generate less revenue than anticipated from our operations or encounter significant unexpected costs, we may fail to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facilities. If we do not comply with our financial covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment from the Bank, the Bank may elect to cause all amounts owed to become immediately due and payable or may decline to renew our credit facility. In that event, we would seek to establish a replacement credit facility with one or more other lenders, including lenders with which we have an existing relationship, potentially on less desirable terms. There can be no guarantee that replacement financing would be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with geographic market concentration.\nOur California operations accounted for approximately 79% of our total revenues in 2018. As a result of the current importance of our California operations and anticipated continued growth from these operations, our profitability over the next several years is expected to be largely dependent on economic and regulatory conditions in California. If California experiences an economic downturn, or if the regulatory environment changes in a way that adversely affects our ability to do business or limits our competitive advantages, our profitability and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to continue to grow revenues, we are dependent on retaining current clients and attracting new clients.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue growth can be volatile and is dependent on same customer sales and the addition of new clients. Revenues increased 2.2% in 2018 and 9.5% in 2017. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow revenues at or near current rates of growth. Maintaining growth rates becomes increasingly difficult as the size of the Company increases. Efforts to achieve business growth intensifies pressure on retaining current clients and attracting increasing numbers of new clients.\n- 10 -\nEconomic conditions, particularly in California, may impact our ability to attract new clients and cause our existing clients to reduce staffing levels or cease operations.\nWeak economic conditions typically have a negative impact on small-and mid-sized businesses, which make up the majority of our clients. In turn, these businesses could cut costs, including trimming employees from their payrolls, or closing locations or ceasing operations altogether. If weak economic conditions were to develop, these forces may result in decreased revenues due both to the downsizing of our current clients and increased difficulties in attracting new clients in a poor economic environment. In addition, weak economic conditions may also result in additional bad debt expense to the extent that existing clients cease operations.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with healthcare reforms.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cActs\u201d) subject us to potential penalties unless we offer our employees minimum essential healthcare coverage that is affordable. In order to comply with the employer mandate provision of the Acts, we offer health care coverage to all temporary and permanent employees eligible for coverage under the Acts other than employees of our PEO clients, which are responsible for providing required health care coverage to their employees. Designating employees as eligible is complex, and is subject to challenge by employees and the Internal Revenue Service. While we believe we have properly identified eligible employees, a later determination that we failed to offer the required health coverage to eligible employees could result in penalties that may materially harm our business. We cannot be certain that compliant insurance coverage will remain available to us on reasonable terms, and we could face additional risks arising from future changes to or repeal of the Acts or changed interpretations of our obligations under the Acts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all related costs through increased pricing to our customers or that such costs will be recovered in the period in which costs are incurred, and the net financial impact on our results of operations could be significant.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers. Service quality issues, whether actual or perceived, and even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies. Also, adverse publicity surrounding labor relations, data breaches, SEC investigations, securities class actions and the like, could negatively affect our overall reputation. Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur staffing business is vulnerable to economic fluctuations.\nDemand for our staffing services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity in the regions in which we do business. As economic activity slows down, companies often reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of permanent staff, resulting in decreased demand for staffing services. During strong economic periods, on the other hand, we often experience shortages of qualified employees to meet customer needs, as occurred during 2018.\nBecause we assume the obligation to make wage, tax and regulatory payments in respect of some employees, we are exposed to client credit risks.\nWe generally assume credit risk associated with our clients\u2019 employee payroll obligations, including liability for payment of salaries and wages (including payroll taxes), as well as retirement benefits. These obligations are fixed whether or not the client makes payments to us as required by our services agreement. We attempt to mitigate this risk by invoicing our clients at the end of their specific payroll processing cycle. We also carefully monitor the timeliness of our clients' payments and impose strict credit standards on our customers. If we fail to successfully manage our credit risk, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n- 11 -\nIncreases in unemployment claims could raise our state and federal unemployment tax rates which we may not be able to pass on to our customers.\nDuring weak economic conditions in our markets, the level of unemployment claims tends to rise as a result of employee layoffs at our clients and lack of work in our temporary staffing pool. The rise in unemployment claims often results in higher state and federal unemployment tax rates, which in most instances cannot be concurrently passed on to our customers either due to existing client services agreements or competitive pricing pressures. Increases in our state and federal unemployment tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly in the early part of the calendar year when payroll tax rates are at or near their maximum.\nIf we are determined not to be an \u201cemployer\u201d under certain laws and regulations, our clients may stop using our services, and we may be subject to additional liabilities.\nWe are the administrative employer in our co-employment relationships under the various laws and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Labor. If we are determined not to be the administrative employer under such laws and regulations and are therefore unable to assume our clients\u2019 obligations for employment and other taxes, our clients may be held jointly and severally liable for payment of such taxes. Some clients or prospective clients may view such potential liability as an unacceptable risk, discouraging current clients from continuing a relationship with us or prospective clients from entering into a new relationship with us. Any determination that we are not the administrative employer for purposes of ERISA could also adversely affect our cafeteria benefits plan operated under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code and result in liabilities to us under the plan.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs and periodic litigation that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe either co-employ employees in connection with our PEO client services agreements or place our employees in our customers' workplace in connection with our staffing business. As such, we are subject to a number of risks inherent to our status as the administrative employer, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nclaims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees, discrimination or harassment claims against our employees, or claims by our employees of discrimination or harassment by our clients;\n\u2022\nimmigration-related claims;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to violations of wage, hour and other workplace regulations;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to employee benefits, entitlements to employee benefits, or errors in the calculation or administration of such benefits; and\n\u2022\npossible claims relating to misuse of customer confidential information, misappropriation of assets or other similar claims.\nIf we experience significant incidents involving any of the above-described risk areas, we could face substantial out-of-pocket losses, fines or negative publicity. In addition, such claims may give rise to litigation, which may be time consuming, distracting and costly, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. With respect to claims involving our co-employer relationships, although our client services agreement provides that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to the conduct of the client or its employees, we may not be able to enforce such contractual indemnification, or the client may not have sufficient assets to satisfy its obligations to us. An increase in employment-related claims against us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n- 12 -\nWe are dependent upon technology services and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our client relationships and our ability to attract new clients may be adversely affected.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our branch network, perform employment-related services and accounting and reporting functions, and summarize and analyze our financial results. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from telecommunications failures, power-related outages, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage our operations, and encounter a loss of client confidence. In addition, our clients\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure or breach we experience. As a result, our relationships with our clients may be impaired, we may lose clients, our ability to attract new clients may be adversely affected, and we could be exposed to contractual liability. We may continue to invest in upgrades or replacements to our existing systems or additional security measures, each of which can involve substantial costs and risks relating to installation and implementation.\nWe depend on third-party software in order to provide our services and support our operations.\nSignificant portions of our services and operations rely on software that is licensed from third-party vendors. The fees associated with these license agreements could increase in future periods, resulting in increased operating expenses. If there are significant changes to the terms and conditions of our license agreements, or if we are unable to renew these license agreements, we may be required to make changes to our vendors or information technology systems. These changes may impact the services we provide to our clients or the processes we have in place to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf our efforts to protect the security of personal information about our employees and clients are unsuccessful, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of personal and proprietary information about thousands of employees and clients. If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our employees and clients could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal and proprietary information, which could cause them to terminate their relationships with us. Any loss of confidence arising from a significant data security breach could hurt our reputation, further damaging our business.\nWe operate in a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nCorporate human resource operations are subject to a broad range of complex and evolving laws and regulations, including those applicable to payroll practices, benefits administration, employment practices, workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and privacy. Because our clients have employees in many states throughout the United States, we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions. Some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change from time to time. Violation of such laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, damage our reputation, constitute a breach of our client agreements, impair our ability to obtain and renew required licenses, and decrease our profitability or competitiveness. If any of these effects were to occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n- 13 -\nChanges in government regulations may result in restrictions or prohibitions applicable to the provision of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing, regulatory or tax requirements.\nOur business is heavily regulated in most jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot provide assurance that the states in which we conduct or seek to conduct business will not:\n\u2022\nimpose additional regulations that prohibit or restrict employment-related businesses like ours;\n\u2022\nrequire additional licensing or add restrictions on existing licenses to provide employment-related services; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes or make changes in the way in which taxes are calculated for providers of employment-related services.\nAny changes in applicable laws and regulations may make it more difficult or expensive for us to do business, inhibit expansion of our business, or result in additional expenses that limit our profitability or decrease our ability to attract and retain clients.\nThe tax status of our insurance subsidiaries could be challenged by taxing authorities resulting in increased or accelerated income tax payments.\nIn conjunction with our workers\u2019 compensation program, we operate two wholly owned insurance subsidiaries, AICE and Ecole. We treat the two subsidiaries as insurance companies for federal and state income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service or a state taxing authority were to determine that the subsidiaries do not qualify as insurance companies, in which insurance reserves are currently deductible, we could be required to make accelerated income tax payments that we otherwise would have deferred until future periods.\nOur wholly owned insurance companies are subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur wholly owned insurance companies are primarily regulated by state insurance commissioners. Such regulation includes monitoring the financial status of these companies, approving policies and premium rates, maintaining requirements for capital surplus and types of investments, and approving any significant changes to the legal or operating structure of these entities. State regulators can also impose taxes and other fees on insurance companies under their jurisdiction. These regulations may restrict our ability to operate these companies in the manner we believe is best, which could increase the cost of our operations, restrict our access to insurance coverage or adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe may find it difficult to expand our business into additional states due to varying state regulatory requirements.\nFuture growth in our operations depends, in part, on our ability to offer our services to prospective clients in new states, which may subject us to different regulatory requirements and standards. In order to operate effectively in a new state, we must obtain all necessary regulatory approvals, adapt our procedures to that state's regulatory requirements and modify our service offerings to adapt to local market conditions. As we expand into additional states, we may not be able to duplicate in other markets the financial performance experienced in our current markets.\n- 14 -\nWe face competition from a number of other companies.\nWe face competition from various companies that may provide all or some of the services we offer. Our competitors include companies that are engaged in staffing services such as Robert Half International Inc., Kelly Services, Inc., and ManpowerGroup Inc.; companies that are focused on co-employment, such as Insperity, Inc., and TriNet Group, Inc.; and companies that primarily provide payroll processing services, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Paychex, Inc. We also face competition from information technology outsourcing firms and broad-based outsourcing and consulting firms that perform individual projects.\nSeveral of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, which may enable them to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and expand their infrastructure and service offerings more quickly and achieve greater cost efficiencies;\n\u2022\ninvest in new technologies;\n\u2022\nexpand operations into new markets more rapidly;\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to marketing;\n\u2022\ncompete for acquisitions more effectively and complete acquisitions more easily; and\n\u2022\naggressively price products and services and increase benefits in ways that we may not be able to match financially.\nIn order to compete effectively in our markets, we must target our potential clients carefully, continue to improve our efficiencies and the scope and quality of our services, and rely on our service quality, innovation, education and program clarity. If our competitive advantages are not compelling or sustainable, then we are unlikely to increase or sustain profits and our stock price could decline.\nWe are dependent upon certain key personnel and recruitment and retention of key employees may be difficult and expensive.\nWe believe that the successful operation of our business is dependent upon our retention of the services of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers and area managers. We may not be able to retain all of our executives, senior managers and key personnel in light of competition for their services. If we lose the services of one of our executive officers or a significant number of our senior managers, our results of operations likely would be adversely affected.\nWe do not have an expansive in-house sales staff and therefore rely extensively on referral partners.\nWe maintain a minimal internal professional sales force, and we rely heavily on referral partners to provide referrals to new business. In connection with these arrangements, we pay a fee to referral partners for new clients. These referral firms and individuals do not have an exclusive relationship with us. If we are unable to maintain these relationships or if they increase their fees or lose confidence in our services, we could face declines in our business and additional costs and uncertainties as we attempt to hire and train an internal sales force.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining qualified employees; during periods of economic growth, our costs to do so increase and attracting and retaining people becomes more difficult.\nOur teams of client-facing professionals are the foundation of our value proposition. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be impaired by economic conditions resulting in lower unemployment and increases in compensation. During periods of economic growth, we face increased competition for retaining and recruiting qualified personnel, which in turn leads to greater advertising and recruiting costs and increased salary expenses. If we cannot attract and retain qualified employees, the quality of our services may deteriorate and our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n- 15 -\nOur service agreements may be terminated on short notice, leaving us vulnerable to loss of a significant amount of customers in a short period of time, if business or regulatory conditions change or events occur that negatively affect our reputation.\nOur client services agreements are generally terminable on 30 days\u2019 notice by either us or our client. As a result, our clients may terminate their agreement with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to changing business or regulatory conditions or changes affecting our reputation or the reputation of our industry.\nOur industry has at times received negative publicity that, if it were to become more prevalent, could cause our business to decline.\nIn the staffing and co-employment industries in which we compete, companies periodically have been tarnished by negative publicity or scandals from poor business judgment or even outright fraud. If we or our industry face negative publicity, customers' confidence in the use of temporary personnel or co-employed workers may deteriorate, and they may be unwilling to enter into or continue our staffing or co-employment relationships. If a negative perception were to prevail, it would be more difficult for us to attract and retain customers.\nChanges in federal and state unemployment tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nIn past years, there has been significant negative publicity relating to the use of staffing or PEO companies to shield employers from poor unemployment history and high unemployment taxes. New legislation enacted at the state or federal level to try to counter this perceived problem could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to market our services or making our services less attractive to our customers and potential customers.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline, resulting in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile for the foreseeable future. Important factors that may cause our trading price to decline include the factors listed below and other factors that may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including those described above in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations, including a significant slowdown in our revenue growth or material increase in our workers\u2019 compensation expense;\n\u2022\nour failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or otherwise discover material errors in our financial reporting;\n\u2022\nimposition of significant fines or penalties or other adverse action by regulatory authorities against the Company;\n\u2022\nadverse developments in legal proceedings involving claims against the Company;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet financial projections or achieve financial results anticipated by analysts; or\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or management.\n- 16 -\nMaryland law and our Charter and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of the Company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law and our Charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring the Company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions of our Charter and bylaws permit the Board of Directors to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences, including voting rights, as the Board may establish, without further approval by the Company's stockholders, which could also adversely affect the voting power of holders of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to the Maryland control share act (the \u201cControl Share Act\u201d). Under the Control Share Act, a person (an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d) who acquires voting stock in a transaction (a \u201cControl Share Acquisition\u201d) which results in its holding voting power within specified ranges cannot vote the shares it acquires in the Control Share Acquisition unless voting rights are accorded to such control shares by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares, excluding the Acquiring Person and the Company's officers and directors who are also employees of the Company.\nThe Company is also subject to the provisions of Maryland law limiting the ability of certain Maryland corporations to engage in specified business combinations (the \u201cBusiness Combination Act\u201d). Subject to certain exceptions, the Business Combination Act prohibits a Maryland corporation from engaging in a business combination with a stockholder who, with its affiliates, owns 10% or more of the corporation's voting stock. These provisions will not apply to business combinations that are approved by the Board of Directors before the stockholder became an interested stockholder.", "PERMNO": 79249, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "BBSI"}
