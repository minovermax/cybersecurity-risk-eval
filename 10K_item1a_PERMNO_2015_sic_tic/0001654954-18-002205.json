{"cik": "2186", "company": "RELM WIRELESS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nVarious portions of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nWe depend on the success of our LMR product line\nWe currently depend on our LMR products as our sole source of sales. A decline in the price of and/or demand for LMR products, as a result of competition, technological change, the introduction of new products by us or others or a failure to manage product transitions successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our future success will largely depend on the successful introduction and sale of new digital LMR products. Even if we successfully develop these products, the development of which is a complex and uncertain process requiring innovation and investment, they may not achieve market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry\nWe face intense competition from other LMR suppliers, and the failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our market share, financial condition and results of operations. The largest supplier of LMR products in the world, Motorola Solutions, Inc., currently is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. This supplier is also the world\u2019s largest supplier of P-25 products. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Some also have established reputations for success in developing and supplying LMR products, including providing complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. We do not provide complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. These advantages may allow them:\n\u25cf\nto be more attractive to customers who desire a single-source supplier of LMR products;\n\u25cf\nto respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, which may render our products obsolete or less marketable;\n\u25cf\nto engage in more extensive research and development;\n\u25cf\nto undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns;\n\u25cf\nto be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities;\n\u25cf\nto adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u25cf\nto be more attractive to potential employees and strategic partners.\nMany of our competitors have established extensive networks of sales locations and multiple distribution channels that are more extensive than ours. We may not be able to compete successfully and competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in the demand for P-25 products could benefit competitors that are better financed and positioned to meet such demand. P-25 products have been brought to the market by an increasing number of our competitors. Our first P-25 portable radio was brought to market in 2003, and in recent years we introduced two new lines of P-25 products, the KNG and KNG2 Series. We are currently developing a new line of multiband products. Bringing such products to market and achieving a significant market penetration for them will continue to require time and expenditures of funds. We may be unsuccessful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, fully functional product enhancements or new products that respond to these and other technological advances, and our new products may not be accepted by customers. An inability to successfully develop and/or market products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and our success is dependent on our ability to adapt to such changes\nOur business could suffer if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes and product development in our industry. The market for our LMR products is characterized by ongoing technological development, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The LMR industry is experiencing a transition from analog LMR products to digital LMR products. In addition, the APCO P-25 standard is being increasingly adopted. If we are unable to successfully keep up with these changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend heavily on sales to the U.S. Government\nWe are subject to risks associated with our reliance on sales to the U.S. Government. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 38% of our sales were to agencies and departments of the U.S. Government. These sales were primarily to agencies of the DHS, DOD, USFS and DOI. We may be unable to maintain this government business. Our ability to maintain our government business will depend on many factors outside of our control, including competitive factors, changes in government personnel making contract decisions, spending limits and political factors. The loss of sales to the U.S. Government would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, most U.S. Government customers award business through a competitive bidding process, which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us. Even if we are awarded contracts, we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract, which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract award to us. In addition, following a contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer delay or our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is partially dependent on U.S. Government contracts, which are highly regulated and subject to terminations and oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives that could result in adverse findings and negatively impact our business\nOur U.S. Government business is subject to specific procurement regulations with numerous compliance requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracting, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs may increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws or policies, including those related to procurement integrity, U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of criminal justice data, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs, foreign corruption and the False Claims Act.\nGenerally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives and could result in adjustments to our contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract or grant may not be allowed, and such costs already reimbursed to us may have to be refunded. Future audits and adjustments, if required, may materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in investigations, termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits or reimbursements, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. All contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the U.S. Government.\nIn addition, contacts with government officials and participation in political activities are areas that are tightly controlled by federal, state, local and international laws. Failure to comply with these laws could cost us opportunities to seek certain government sales opportunities or even result in fines, prosecution or debarment.\nOur business is subject to the economic and political risks of manufacturing products in foreign countries\nWe engage in business with manufacturers located in other countries. Approximately 65.7% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2017 were sourced internationally. Accordingly, we are subject to special considerations and risks not typically associated with companies operating solely in the U.S. These include the risks associated with the political, economic and legal environments in such foreign countries, among others. Our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the general political and social conditions in foreign countries in which we maintain sourcing relationships, unfavorable changes in U.S. trade legislation and regulations, the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or other trade barriers, threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, labor disruptions, currency controls, fluctuating exchange rates with respect to contracts not denominated in U.S. dollars, and unanticipated or unfavorable changes in government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflation measures and method of taxation. If we were unable to navigate foreign regulatory environments, or if we were unable to enforce our contract rights in foreign countries, our business could be adversely impacted. Any of these events could interrupt our manufacturing process and cause operational disruptions, increase prices for manufacturing, reduce our sales or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nWe carry substantial quantities of inventory, and inaccurate estimates of necessary inventory could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition\nWe carry a significant amount of inventory to service customer requirements in a timely manner. If we are unable to sell this inventory over a commercially reasonable time, in the future we may be required to take inventory markdowns, which would reduce our net sales and/or gross margins. In addition, it is critical to our success that we accurately predict trends in customer demand, including seasonal fluctuations, in the future and do not overstock unpopular products or fail to sufficiently stock popular products. Both scenarios could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs or hedge our risks associated with currency fluctuations\nWe sometimes enter into firm fixed-price contracts. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Because certain of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, require us to engage subcontractors and/or can last multiple years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns, can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, a significant increase in inflation rates or currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longer-term contracts.\nOur investment strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our financial condition\nWe may invest part of our cash balances in public companies. For example, as of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 1.3 million shares of the common stock of Iteris, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITI) (\u201cIteris\u201d). These types of investments are more risky than holding our cash balances as bank deposits or, for example, such conservative investments as treasury bonds or money market funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the value or the performance of the companies in which we have invested or in which we may invest in the future, or that we will be able to achieve returns or benefits from these investments. We may lose all or part of our investment relating to such companies if their value decreases as a result of their financial performance or for any other reason. If our interests differ from those of other investors in companies over which we do not have control, we may be unable to effect any change at those companies. We are not required to meet any diversification standards, and our investments may become concentrated. If our investment strategy is not successful or we achieve less than expected returns from these investments, it could have a material adverse effect on us. The Board of Directors may also change our investment strategy at any time, and such changes could further increase our exposure, which could adversely impact us.\nFundamental Global Investors, LLC, with its affiliates, is our largest stockholder whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders\nThe interests of Fundamental Global Investors, LLC (\u201cFundamental Global\u201d) may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Fundamental Global and its affiliates, including Ballantyne Strong, Inc., of which Fundamental Global is the largest stockholder, and CWA Asset Management Group, LLC, 50% of which is owned by Fundamental Global, together hold approximately 35% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock. Kyle Cerminara, Chief Executive Officer, Partner and Manager of Fundamental Global and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ballantyne Strong, Inc. and Lewis Johnson, President, Partner and Manager of Fundamental Global Investors, LLC and a director of Ballantyne Strong, Inc., serve on our Board of Directors. As a result of its ownership position and Messrs. Cerminara\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s positions with the Company, Fundamental Global has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the power to impact the election of our directors, and approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as amendments to our articles of incorporation, by-laws, significant stock issuances, mergers and asset sales. Fundamental Global may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to their interests. Fundamental Global\u2019s significant ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand and reputation, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed\nOur business, results of operations and prospects depend, in part, on maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation for providing high-quality products and services. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. Although reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. If problems with our products cause operational disruption or other difficulties, or there are delays or other issues with the delivery of our products or services, our brand and reputation could be diminished. Damage to our reputation could also arise from actual or perceived legal violations, product safety issues, data security breaches, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor service, actual or perceived poor privacy practices, operational or sustainability issues, actual or perceived ethical issues or other events within or outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to us. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could lead to lost sales, loss of new opportunities and retention and recruiting difficulties. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe face a number of risks related to challenging economic conditions\nCurrent economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere remain uncertain. These challenging economic conditions could materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity and financial condition in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf\nPotential deferment or reduction of purchases by customers: Significant deficits and limited appropriations confronting our federal, state and local government customers may cause them to defer or reduce purchases of our products. Furthermore, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions may cause customers to defer purchases of our products in response to tighter credit and decreased cash availability.\n\u25cf\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers, distributors and suppliers: We make sales to certain of our customers through third-party dealers and distributors. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvencies of these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition the end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or directly from us, it could materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Challenging economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could negatively affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\n\u25cf\nLimited access by us to credit and capital: Although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term, the credit markets may limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers and on a limited number of suppliers of components to produce our products and the inability to obtain adequate and timely delivery of supplies and manufactured products could have a material adverse effect on us\nWe contract with manufacturers to produce portions of our products, and our dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers exposes us to certain risks, including shortages of manufacturing capacity, reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, production yield and costs. If any of our manufacturers terminate production or cannot meet our production requirements, we may have to rely on other contract manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new contract manufacturers. The lead-time required to qualify a new manufacturer could range from approximately two to six months. Despite efforts to do so, we may not be able to identify or qualify new contract manufacturers in a timely and cost-effective manner, and these new manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Any significant delay in our ability to obtain adequate quantities of our products from our current or alternative contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our dependence on limited and sole source suppliers of components involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality. Approximately 61.6% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2017 were sourced from three suppliers. We place purchase orders from time to time with these suppliers and have no guaranteed supply arrangements. Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products. The lead-time required for orders of some of our components is as much as six months. In addition, the lead-time required to qualify new suppliers for our components is as much as six months. If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products. This may damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and, thus, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth\nAcquisitions and other business transactions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We do not have any acquisitions currently pending, and there can be no assurance that we will complete any future acquisitions or other business transactions or that any such transactions which are completed will prove favorable to our business. We intend to seek stockholder approval for any such transactions only when so required by applicable law or regulation. Any acquisitions of businesses and their respective assets also involve the risks that the businesses and assets acquired may prove to be less valuable than we expect and we may assume unknown or unexpected liabilities, costs and problems. We hope to grow rapidly, and the failure to manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Our business plan contemplates, among other things, leveraging our products and technology for growth in our customer base and sales. This growth, if it materializes, could significantly challenge our management, employees, operations and financial capabilities. In the event of this expansion, we have to continue to implement and improve our operating systems and to expand, train, and manage our employee base. If we are unable to manage and integrate our expanding operations effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRetention of our executive officers and key personnel is critical to our business\nOur key executives are critical to our success. We do not have employment agreements with these individuals, and we cannot be sure that we will retain their services. The loss of services from any of our executive officers or these other key employees due to any reason whatsoever could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is also dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified operations, development and other personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to hire or retain necessary personnel. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of contract, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights, and failure to effectively utilize or successfully assert these rights could negatively impact us\nCurrently, we hold no U.S. patents. We have applied for several trademarks related to the names \u201cBK Technologies\u201d and \u201cBK Radio.\u201d As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, distributors and customers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights. There is a risk that we may be unable to prevent another party from manufacturing and selling competing products or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. It may also be particularly difficult to protect our products and intellectual property under the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position and could negatively impact us.\nRising health care costs may have a material adverse effect on us\nThe costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes and general economic conditions. We cannot predict what other health care programs and regulations ultimately will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. on our business and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict when or if Congress will repeal and/or replace certain health care programs and regulations at the federal level and the impact such changes would have on our business. A continued increase in health care costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nOur stock price is vulnerable to significant fluctuations, including due to our fluctuating quarterly operating results\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of the investment community, resulting in volatility for the market price for our common stock. Other factors affecting the volatility of our stock price include:\n\u25cf\nfuture announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement or introduction of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates by us or our competitors or by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of our key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for the stock of many companies generally, which fluctuations often are unrelated to operating performance.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other catastrophic events beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes; geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers or manufacturers are located, or acts of war or terrorism (wherever located around the world) or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems or otherwise causing damage to our business, employees, suppliers, manufacturers and customers; or other highly disruptive events, such as nuclear accidents, pandemics, unusual weather conditions or cyber attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Such events could result, among other things, in operational disruptions, physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties or properties used by third parties in connection with the supply of products or services to us, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations and communications and transportation disruptions. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and could also have indirect consequences, such as increases in the costs of insurance, if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nThe availability of our credit facility is conditioned upon our being in compliance with certain covenants\nWe have a $1.0 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d). As of December 31, 2017 and as of the date of this report, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The loan and security agreement governing the credit facility contains certain financial maintenance and other covenants. Failure to comply with any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that would permit SVB to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings at the time of occurrence. We are currently in compliance with all covenants. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to comply with the covenants in the future or, in the event we fail to do so, that we will be able to either obtain a waiver from SVB or refinance the credit facility in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all.\nA security breach or other significant disruption of our information technology systems, or those of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and other partners, caused by cyber attack or other means, could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and results of operations\nOur information technology systems, and those of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and other partners, are potentially vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or interruption from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, continually evolving cyber attacks (including social engineering and phishing attempts), cyber intrusion, computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, sabotage, war and telecommunication failures. Cyber attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures, or security measures of those parties that we do business with now or in the future, and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees and partners or our business information. A cyber attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems or those of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers or other partners, could result in the unauthorized release of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information of ours or our customers. Such unauthorized access to, or release of, this information could expose us to data loss, allow others to unfairly compete with us, subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could also significantly harm our reputation. Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe risk of noncompliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us could materially adversely affect us\nFailure to comply with government regulations applicable to our business could result in penalties and reputational damage. Our products are regulated by the FCC and otherwise subject to a wide range of global laws. As a public company, we are also subject to regulations of the SEC and the stock exchange on which we are listed. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. Compliance with existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. Failure to comply with or to respond to changes in these requirements and regulations could result in penalties on us, such as fines, restrictions on operations or a temporary or permanent closure of our facility. These penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, existing or new regulatory requirements or interpretations could materially adversely impact us.\nWe may not be able to maintain our NYSE American listing\nOur common stock has been listed on the NYSE American since 2005. If we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of the NYSE American, which include, among others, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, market capitalization, pre-tax income and per share sales price, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, we would be forced to list our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or some other quotation medium, depending on our ability to meet the specific requirements of those quotation systems. In that case, we may lose some or all of our institutional investors, and selling our common stock on the OTC Markets would be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold and transactions could be delayed. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock. If this happens, we will have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets to raise any additional necessary capital.\nAny infringement claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nAs the number of competing products available in the market increases and the functions of those products further overlap, the potential for infringement claims may increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, may result in costly litigation or require us to redesign the affected product to avoid infringement or require us to obtain a license for future sales of the affected product. Any of the foregoing could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any litigation resulting from any such claim could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant resources, including the efforts of our management and engineering personnel.\nReforms to the U.S. federal income tax regulations could adversely affect us\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law, substantially reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2018. This legislation includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, including a decrease in corporate tax rates, which results in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, among other significant changes. Some of these reforms could adversely affect our business, and we continue to evaluate the effect the 2017 Tax Act may have on us.\nWe have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to utilize under certain circumstances\nIf we incur future operating losses, we may be required to provide some or all of our deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, resulting in additional non-cash income tax expense. The change in the valuation may have a material impact on future results. If we do not achieve sufficient federal taxable income in future years to utilize all or some of our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), they will expire.\nWe may be unable to obtain components and parts that are verified to be Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) conflict-free, which could result in reputational damage\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (which are defined as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) in our products and whether these materials originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The SEC rules necessitate a complex compliance process and related administrative expense for a company once it determines a conflict mineral is necessary to the functionality or production of a product that the company manufactures or contracts to manufacture. Such companies must then conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine if the conflict minerals originated in the covered countries and undertake due diligence on the source and chain of custody in order to file a conflict minerals report with the SEC. In addition to the increased administrative expense and management involvement, there is a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us \u201cconflict-free\u201d components, parts and manufactured products, particularly since our supply chain is complex and, as a purchaser of finished components, we are several layers removed from the mining of any potential conflict minerals that may be contained in our products. We may not be able to obtain conflict-free products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations. We may also continue to be unable to determine if our products are conflict-free. If we discover that our products include minerals that have been identified as \u201cnot found to be DRC conflict-free,\u201d or if we continue to be unable to determine whether such minerals are included in our products, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders as a result.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price and impair our ability to raise equity capital\nApproximately 6.4 million (46%) of our shares of outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017 are owned by certain of our executive officers and directors and other affiliates, and may be resold publicly at any time, subject to the volume and other restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Approximately 54% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2017 are freely tradable without restriction.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or even the potential for such sales, could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.", "PERMNO": 10779, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "BKTI"}
