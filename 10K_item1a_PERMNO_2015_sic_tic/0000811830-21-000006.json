{"cik": "811830", "company": "Santander Holdings USA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and access to liquidity materially. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our businesses. Accordingly, the Company encounters risk as part of the normal course of its businesses. Some of the Company\u2019s more significant challenges and risks include the following:\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business. Closures and disruptions to businesses in the U.S. due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to negative effects on our customers, in some situations, reducing demand for certain of our products and services and necessitating greater customer support initiatives. Actions by government authorities to control the spread of COVID-19 and provide economic relief to the public, such as allowing customers to forego making scheduled loan payments or precluding creditors from exercising rights with respect to collateral, may contribute to negative effects to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. Disruptions and volatility in financial markets can have a material adverse effect on our ability to access capital and liquidity on acceptable financial terms. Negative and fluctuating economic conditions, such as a changing interest rate environment, may cause our lending margins to decrease and reduce customer demand for our higher margin products and services.\n\u2022Uncertainty regarding LIBOR may affect our business adversely. We have established an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, asses and monitor risks associated with the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR. However, there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for the potential disruption to financial markets and potential adverse effects to interest rates on our loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments currently tied to LIBOR.\n\u2022We are subject to substantial regulation. As a financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies, including limitations on permissible activities, required financial stress tests, required non-objection to certain actions, investigations and other regulatory proceedings. If we are unable to meet the expectations of our regulators fully, we may need to divert significant resources to remedial actions, be unable to take planned capital actions, and/or be subject to fines or other enforcement actions, among other things. These circumstances could affect our revenues and expenses and other aspects of our business and operations adversely.\n\u2022We may not be able to detect money laundering or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis. We work regularly to improve our policies, procedures and capabilities to detect and prevent financial crimes. However, such crimes are evolving continually, and there will be instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering or other illegal or improper activities. These instances may result in regulatory fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\n\u2022Credit risk is inherent in our business. Our customers\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 financial condition, repayment abilities, repayment intentions, the value of their collateral, and government economic policies, market interest rates and other factors affect the quality of our loan portfolio. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses.\n\u2022Liquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business. Changes in market interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously, may be unpredictable and highly volatile and can significantly increase our cost of funding. We rely primarily on deposits to fund lending activities. However, our ability to maintain or grow deposits depends on factors outside our control, such as general economic conditions and confidence of depositors in the economy and the financial services industry. If deposit withdrawals increase significantly in a short period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\n\u2022We are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to factors beyond our control, such as increased regulation of the financial sector, monetary policies, economic and political conditions, and other factors. Variations in interest rates could impact net interest income, which comprises the majority of our revenue, reducing our growth and potentially resulting in losses.\n\u2022We are subject to significant competition. We compete with banks that are larger than us and non-traditional providers of banking services who may not be subject to the same regulatory or legislative requirements to which we are subject. If we are unable to compete successfully with current and new competitors and anticipate changing banking industry trends, our business may be affected adversely.\n\u2022Risks relating to data collection, processing, storage systems and data security. Proper functioning of financial controls, accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively. Inadequate personnel, inadequate or failed internal control processes or systems, or external events that interrupt normal business operations could each impair our data collection, processing, storage systems and data security and result in losses.\n\u2022We and others in our industry face cybersecurity risks. We take protective measures and monitor and develop our systems continuously to protect our technology infrastructure and data from cyberattacks. However, cybersecurity risks continue to increase for our industry, and the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of parties behind such attacks present risks for compromised data, theft of funds or theft or destruction of corporate information and assets.\n\u2022SC\u2019s financial results could impact our results. SC\u2019s earnings have historically been a significant source of funding for the Company. Factors that could negatively affect SC\u2019s financial results could consequently affect SHUSA\u2019s financial results.\nThe above list is not exhaustive, and we face additional challenges and risks. Please carefully consider all of the information in this Form-K including matters set forth in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nRisk Factors\nRisk management and mitigation are important parts of the Company's business model and integrated into the Company's day-to-day operations. The success of the Company's business is dependent on management's ability to identify, understand, manage and mitigate the risks presented by business activities in light of the Company's strategic and financial objectives. These risks include credit risk, market risk, capital risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, investment risk, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputational risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following are the most significant risk factors that affect the Company. Any one or more of these could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, many of which are described below. These risk factors and other risks we may face are also discussed further in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe current outbreak COVID-19, has materially impacted our business, and the continuance of this pandemic or any future outbreak of any other highly contagious diseases or other public health emergency, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 was first reported in China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, including the United States. The outbreak has been declared a public health emergency of international concern and a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As of the date hereof, a significant number of countries and the majority of state governments in the United States have also made emergency declarations related to the outbreak, and have attempted to slow community spread of the virus by providing social distancing guidelines and issuing stay-at-home orders, and mandating the closure of certain non-essential businesses from time to time.\nThe actions taken by authorities have not always been implemented on a consistent basis, contributing to the continued spread of COVID-19. Further, these actions are not always coordinated across jurisdictions and, at times, led to economic hardship in the jurisdictions in which they have been implemented. For example, in many jurisdictions, businesses have been required to temporarily close or restrict their operations. Further, even for businesses that have remained open, in-person interactions have been limited and consumer demand has deteriorated rapidly. As a result, earlier in 2020 we experienced a significant decline in our origination of loans and leases.\nClosures and disruptions to businesses, leading to loss of revenue and unemployment, have led to negative effects on our customers. Similar to many other financial institutions, we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate our customers\u2019 COVID-related economic challenges. Earlier in 2020, we announced that we were providing additional support to customers, employees, and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and revised our servicing practices to increase the maximum number of permitted monthly payment extensions, grant waivers for late charges, permit mortgage loan forbearance, and provide lease extensions. Unlike the regional impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted customers nationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on the performance of our loan and auto lease portfolios over time than even the most severe historical natural disaster. As an example, we have experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions and modifications related to COVID-19 nationwide, and a significant number of such extensions and modifications have been granted. Further, we have temporarily suspended - and may continue to temporarily suspend - involuntary repossessions, although we may elect to re-initiate involuntary repossessions at any time. We also placed foreclosures on hold beginning in March 2020, and anticipate refraining from this activity until further notice.\nFurther, in an effort to provide COVID-19 assistance, government and regulatory authorities could also enact laws, regulations, executive orders and other guidance that allow customers to forego making scheduled payments for some period of time, require modifications to receivables (e.g., waiving accrued interest), preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, including repossession or liquidation of the collateral, or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the Company or our vendors as \u201cnon-essential businesses\u201d or otherwise. While we have business continuity plans in place, if significant portions of our or our vendors\u2019 workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, stay-at-home orders, facility closures, reductions in services or hours of operation, or ineffective remote work arrangements, there may be servicing disruptions, which could result in reduced collection effectiveness or our ability to operate our business and satisfy our obligations under our third-party servicing agreements.\nWe rely upon our ability to access various credit facilities to fund our operations. As international trade and business activity slowed and supply chains were disrupted related to the COVID-19 pandemic, global credit and financial markets experienced significant disruption and volatility. Earlier this year, financial markets experienced significant declines and volatility, and such market conditions may occur again and/or precede recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy. Under these circumstances, we may experience some or all of the risks related to market volatility and recessionary conditions described under the caption \"We are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets\" in this Risk Factors section . These include reduced demand for our products and services and reduced access to capital markets funding.\nGovernmental and regulatory authorities implemented fiscal and monetary policies and initiatives to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy and individual businesses and households, such as the reduction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate to near zero in March 2020 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement of capital preservation measures applicable to banking organizations in June and September 2020, such as suspending share repurchases, capping dividend payments, requiring banking organizations to re-evaluate their longer-term capital plans and requiring resubmission of capital plans to reflect more recent macroeconomic developments. In addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act provided financial institutions with the option to suspend certain GAAP requirements for coronavirus-related loan modifications that would otherwise constitute troubled debt restructurings and further required the U.S. federal banking agencies to defer to financial institutions\u2019 determinations in making such suspensions. However, these governmental and regulatory actions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of COVID-19. Sustained adverse economic effects from the pandemic may also result in downgrades in our credit ratings or adversely affect the interest rate environment.\nDue to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic, we are currently unable to estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19. If the pandemic is prolonged, or other diseases emerge that give rise to similar effects, the adverse impact to the global economy could deepen. The pandemic may also cause us to experience lower originations and higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, reduced access to funding or significantly increased costs of funding, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets. Any or all of the scenarios described in the preceding paragraphs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and increase the likelihood of experiencing other risks described in our Risk Factors.\nMacro-Economic and Political Risks\nGiven that our loan portfolios are concentrated in the United States, adverse changes affecting the economy of the United States could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur loan portfolios are concentrated in the United States. Accordingly, the recoverability of our loan portfolios and our ability to increase the amount of loans outstanding and our results of operations and financial condition in general are dependent to a significant extent on the level of economic activity in the United States. Recessionary conditions in the United States economy would likely have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets.\nWe face, among others, the following risks in the event of an economic downturn or another recession:\n\u2022Increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation has increased our costs and may affect the pricing of our products and services and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u2022Reduced demand for our products and services.\n\u2022Inability of our borrowers to timely or fully comply with their existing obligations.\n\u2022The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how those economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\n\u2022The degree of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process and the sufficiency of our ALLL.\n\u2022The value and liquidity of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected.\n\u2022Any worsening of economic conditions may delay the recovery of the financial industry and impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Macroeconomic shocks may impact the household income of our retail customers negatively and adversely affect the recoverability of our retail loans, resulting in increased loan and lease losses.\nDespite the long-term expansion of the U.S. economy, some uncertainty remains regarding U.S. monetary policy and the future economic environment. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve. Such economic uncertainty could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A downturn of the economic expansion or failure to sustain the economic recovery would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on us and on others in the financial services industry.\nIn addition, these concerns continue even as the global economy recovers, and some previously stressed European economies have experienced at least partial recoveries from their low points during the recession. If measures to address sovereign debt and financial sector problems in Europe are inadequate, or if European nations default on their debt or experience a significant widening of credit spreads, it may delay or weaken economic recovery, adversely affect major financial institutions and bank systems throughout Europe, result in the further exit of member states from the Eurozone or contribute to other more severe economic and financial conditions. If realized, these risk scenarios could contribute to severe stress and adverse consequences for global financial markets, likely affecting the economy and capital markets in the United States as well.\nIncreased disruption and volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable to us, if at all. If capital markets financing ceases to become available, or becomes excessively expensive, we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits to attract more customers and become unable to maintain certain liability maturities. Any such decrease in capital markets funding availability or increased costs or in deposit rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margins and liquidity.\nIf some or all of the foregoing risks were to materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth, asset quality and profitability may be adversely affected by volatile macroeconomic and political conditions.\nWhile the United States economy has performed well overall, it has experienced volatility in recent periods, characterized by slow or regressive growth. This volatility has resulted in fluctuations in the levels of deposits at depository institutions and in the relative economic strength of various segments of the economy to which we lend.\nNegative and fluctuating economic conditions, such as a changing interest rate environment, impact our profitability by causing lending margins to decrease and leading to decreased demand for higher margin products and services. Negative and fluctuating economic conditions could also result in government defaults on public debt. This could affect us in two ways: directly, through portfolio losses, and indirectly, through instabilities that a default on public debt could cause to the banking system as a whole, particularly since commercial banks' exposure to government debt is high in certain Latin American and European regions or countries.\nIn addition, our revenues are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, social instability, and changes in governmental policies, international ownership legislation, interest rate caps and tax policies. Growth, asset quality and profitability may be affected by volatile macroeconomic and political conditions.\nUncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect our business\nThe UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In December 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced its intention to cease publication of LIBOR settings. The administrator indicated that it intends to cease publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR setting immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings will cease immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023.\nSeveral international working groups are focused on transition plans and alternative contract language seeking to address potential market disruption that could arise from the replacement of LIBOR with a new reference rate. For example, in the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group convened by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and comprised of private sector entities, banking regulators and other financial regulators, including the SEC, has identified SOFR as its preferred alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. In addition, ISDA launched the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which amend ISDA\u2019s standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain IBORs, with the changes coming into effect on January 25, 2021. From that date, all new cleared and non-cleared derivatives that reference the definitions include the fallbacks. As a result of signing on to the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, we will be able to incorporate those revisions into our legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the Protocol.\nEven with the market progression away from LIBOR, there is no assurance that a replacement rate will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of a new rate will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR. If LIBOR were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, it could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company, in collaboration with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is engaged in an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, assess, monitor and remediate risks associated with the potential discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR and the transition to use of alternative reference rates such as SOFR. As part of these efforts, the Company has established a LIBOR Transition Steering Committee that includes the Company\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer and representatives of the Company\u2019s significant subsidiaries and business lines. Among other matters, the Company is identifying assets and liabilities tied to LIBOR, the exposure of its subsidiaries to LIBOR, the degree to which fallback language currently exists in the Company\u2019s contracts that references LIBOR, and monitoring relevant industry developments and publications by market associations and clearing houses.\nWhile we continue the process of identifying existing contracts that extend beyond December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2023 to determine their exposure to LIBOR, there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of LIBOR, or of the timing of the adoption and degree of integration of alternative reference rates in financial markets relevant to us. If LIBOR ceases to exist, or if new methods of calculating LIBOR are established, interest rates on our loans, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR, as well as revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected, and financial markets relevant to us could be disrupted. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $25 billion of assets and approximately $10 billion of liabilities with LIBOR exposure. We also had approximately $71 billion in notional amounts of off-balance sheet contracts with LIBOR exposure.\nEven if financial instruments are transitioned to alternative reference rates successfully, the new reference rates are likely to differ from the previous reference rates, and the value and return on those instruments could be impacted adversely. We could also be subject to increased costs and pricing risk due to paying higher interest rates on our existing financial instruments and how changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments. We could incur legal risks in the event of such changes, as re-negotiation and changes to documentation for new and existing transactions may be required, especially if parties to an instrument cannot agree on how to effect the transition. We could incur conduct risks arising from the potential impact of communication with customers and engagement during the transition period. We could also incur further operational risks due to the potential need to adapt information technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure, and operational processes and controls, including models and hedging strategies.\nIn addition, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to LIBOR's expected discontinuation. This could result, for example, if a sufficient number of banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that scenario, risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR would be accelerated for us and the rest of the financial industry.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to substantial regulation which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nAs a financial institution, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, which materially affects our businesses. The statutes, regulations, and policies to which the Company is subject may change at any time. In addition, regulators' interpretation and application of the laws and regulations to which the Company is subject may change from time to time. Extensive legislation affecting the financial services industry has been adopted in the United States, and regulations have been and are in the process of being implemented. The manner in which those laws and related regulations are applied to the operations of financial institutions is still evolving. Any legislative or regulatory actions and any required or other changes to our business operations resulting from such legislation and regulations could result in significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging and provide certain products and services, affect the value of assets we hold, compel us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance and other costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or in their interpretation or application will not affect us adversely.\nRegulation of the Company as a BHC includes limitations on permissible activities. Moreover, the Company and the Bank are required to perform stress tests and submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties and enforcement actions for violations we may commit, and has the authority to disallow acquisitions we or our subsidiaries may contemplate, which may limit our future growth plans. Such constraints currently applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries and/or regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther regulations that significantly affect the Company, or that could significantly affect the Company in the future, relate to capital requirements, liquidity and funding, taxation of the financial sector, and development of regulatory reforms in the United States.\nIn addition, the volume, granularity, frequency and scale of regulatory and other reporting requirements necessitate a clear data strategy to enable consistent data aggregation, reporting and management. Inadequate management information systems or processes, including those relating to risk data aggregation and risk reporting, could lead to a failure to meet regulatory reporting requirements or other internal or external information demands that may result in supervisory measures.\nSignificant United States Regulation\nFrom time to time, we are or may become subject to or involved in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information gathering requests by federal and state government agencies, including, among others, the FRB, the OCC, the CFPB, the FDIC, the DOJ, the SEC, FINRA the Federal Trade Commission and various state regulatory and enforcement agencies.\nThe DFA will continue to result in significant structural reforms affecting the financial services industry. This legislation provided for, among other things, the establishment of the CFPB with broad authority to regulate the credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services we offer, the creation of a structure to regulate systemically important financial companies, more comprehensive regulation of the OTC derivatives market, prohibitions on engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, restrictions on ownership of, investment in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds and restrictions on interchange fees earned through debit card transactions.\nThe DFA provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory clearing, exchange trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives. Entities that are swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants or major security-based swap participants are required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or both, and are or will be subject to new capital, margin, business conduct, record-keeping, clearing, execution, reporting and other requirements. We may register as a swap dealer with the CFTC.\nWithin the DFA, the Volcker Rule prohibits \u201cbanking entities\u201d from engaging in certain forms of proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in covered funds, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also limits the ability of banking entities and their affiliates to enter into certain transactions with such funds with which they or their affiliates have certain relationships. The final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule contain exclusions and certain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, and trading in United States government and agency obligations as well as certain foreign government obligations, and trading solely outside the United States, and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained.\nOur resolution in a bankruptcy proceeding could result in losses for holders of our debt and equity securities.\nUnder regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and as required by Section 165(d) of the DFA, we and Santander must provide to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a Section 165(d) Resolution Plan. The purpose of this DFA provision is to provide regulators with plans that would enable them to resolve failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a manner that mitigates such risk. The most recently filed Section 165(d) Resolution Plan by Santander, dated as of December 31, 2018, provides a roadmap for the orderly resolution of the material U.S. operations of Santander under hypothetical stress scenarios and the failure of one or more of its U.S. MEs. MEs are defined as subsidiaries or foreign offices of Santander that are significant to the activities of a critical operation or core business line. The U.S. MEs identified in the 2018 Resolution Plan include, among other entities, the Company, the Bank and SC.\nThe 2018 Resolution Plan describes a strategy for resolving Santander\u2019s U.S. operations, including its U.S. MEs and the core business lines that operate within those U.S. MEs, in a manner that would substantially mitigate the risk that the resolutions would have serious adverse effects on U.S. or global financial stability. Under the 2018 Resolution Plan\u2019s hypothetical resolutions of the U.S. MEs, the Bank would be placed into FDIC receivership and the Company and SC would be placed into bankruptcy under Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, respectively.\nThe strategy described in the 2018 Resolution Plan contemplates a \u201cmultiple point of entry\u201d strategy, in which Santander and the Company would each undergo separate resolution proceedings under European regulations and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, respectively. In a scenario in which the Bank and SC were in resolution, the Company would file a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and holders of our LTD and other debt securities would be junior to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Company.\nThe Company, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC are not obligated to follow the Company\u2019s preferred resolution strategy for resolving its U.S. operations under its resolution plan. In addition, Santander could in the future change its resolution strategy for resolving its U.S. operations. In an alternative scenario, the Company alone could enter bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed, using assets of the Company, so that they could continue normal operations as going concerns or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the losses incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries would be imposed first on the holders of the Company\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors, including holders of our LTD and other debt securities. Holders of our LTD and other debt securities would be junior to the claims of creditors of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Company. Under either of these scenarios, in a resolution of the Company under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of our LTD and other debt securities would realize value only to the extent available to the Company as a shareholder of the Bank, SC and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Company have been fully repaid.\nThe resolution of the Company under the orderly liquidation authority could result in greater losses for holders of our equity and debt securities.\nThe ability of holders of our LTD and other debt securities to recover the full amount that would otherwise be payable on those securities in a resolution proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code may be impaired by the exercise of the FDIC\u2019s powers under the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d under Title II of the DFA.\nTitle II of the DFA created a new resolution regime known as the \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d to which financial companies, including U.S. IHC of FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more, such as the Company, can be subjected. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver to liquidate a financial company if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the United States Secretary of the Treasury determines that the entity is in severe financial distress, the entity\u2019s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system, and resolution under the orderly liquidation authority would avoid or mitigate those effects, among other things. Absent such determinations, the Company would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nIf the FDIC were appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have transacted with the Company. There are substantial differences between the rights available to creditors under the orderly liquidation authority and under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC may disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances (which would otherwise be respected under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code), and an administrative claims procedures is used to determine creditors\u2019 claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings). Under the orderly liquidation authority, in certain circumstances, the FDIC could elevate the priority of claims if it determines that doing so is necessary to facilitate a smooth and orderly liquidation without the need to obtain the consent of other creditors or prior court review. Furthermore, the FDIC has the right to transfer assets or liabilities of the failed company to a third party or \u201cbridge\u201d entity under the orderly liquidation authority.\nRegardless of what resolution strategy Santander might prefer for resolving its U.S. operations, the FDIC could determine that it is a desirable strategy to resolve the Company in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on the Company\u2019s shareholder, unsecured debtholders (including holders of our LTD) and other creditors, while permitting the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to continue to operate. It is likely that the application of such an entry strategy in which the Company would be the only legal entity in the U.S. to enter resolution proceedings would result in greater losses to holders of our LTD and other debt securities than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy for the Company. Assuming the Company entered resolution proceedings and support from the Company to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level could be transferred to the Company and ultimately borne by the Company\u2019s securityholders (including holders of our LTD and other debt securities), with the result that third-party creditors of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while the Company\u2019s securityholders (including holders of our LTD) and other unsecured creditors could face significant losses. In addition, in a resolution under the orderly liquidation authority, holders of our LTD and other debt securities of the Company could face losses ahead of our other similarly situated creditors if the FDIC exercised its right, to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims described above.\nThe orderly liquidation authority also requires that creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership must bear all losses before taxpayers are exposed to any losses, and amounts owed by the financial company or the receivership to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including holders of our LTD and other debt securities. In addition, under the orderly liquidation authority, claims of creditors (including holders of our LTD and other debt securities) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which the Company\u2019s assets are transferred, as described above. If securities were to be delivered in satisfaction of claims, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged.\nAlthough the FDIC has issued regulations to implement the orderly liquidation authority, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known, and additional rulemaking is possible.\nUnited States stress testing, capital planning, and related supervisory actions\nThe Company is subject to stress testing and capital planning requirements under regulations implementing the DFA and other banking laws and policies. Effective January 2017, the Federal Reserve finalized a rule adjusting its capital plan and stress testing rules, exempting from the qualitative portion of the CCAR certain BHCs and U.S. IHCs of FBOs with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion and total nonbank assets of less than $75 billion, and that are not identified as global systemically important banks. Such firms, including the Company, are still required to meet CCAR\u2019s quantitative requirements and are subject to regular supervisory assessments that examine their capital planning processes. In 2018, 2019, and 2020 the Federal Reserve did not object to SHUSA\u2019s capital plan; however, in 2015 and 2016, the Federal Reserve, as part of its CCAR process, objected on qualitative grounds to the capital plans the Company submitted. There is risk that the Federal Reserve could object to the Company\u2019s future capital plans, which would limit the Company's ability to make capital distributions or take certain capital actions.\nOther supervisory actions and restrictions on U.S. activities\nIn addition to the foregoing, U.S. bank regulatory agencies from time to time take supervisory actions under certain circumstances that restrict or limit a financial institution\u2019s activities. In many instances, we are subject to significant legal restrictions on our ability to disclose these actions or the full details of these actions publicly. In addition, as part of the regular examination process, certain U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 regulators may advise the subsidiary to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve has the authority to disallow us and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries from engaging in certain categories of new activities in the United States or acquiring shares or control of other companies in the United States. Such actions and restrictions currently applicable to us or certain of our U.S. subsidiaries could adversely affect our costs and revenues. Moreover, efforts to comply with nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions could require material investments in additional resources and systems, as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention. As a result, such supervisory actions or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may be subject to significant legal restrictions on our ability to publicly disclose these matters or the full details of these actions.\nWe are subject to potential intervention by any of our regulators or supervisors, particularly in response to customer complaints.\nAs noted above, our business and operations are subject to significant rules and regulations relating to the banking and financial services business. These apply to business operations, affect financial returns, include reserve and reporting requirements, and the conduct of our business. These requirements are established by the relevant central banks and regulatory authorities that authorize, regulate and supervise us in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The relationship between the Company and its customers is also regulated extensively under federal and state consumer protection laws. Among other things, these laws prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive trading practices, require disclosures of the cost of credit, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, and restrict our ability to raise interest rates.\nIn their supervisory roles, regulators seek to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions with the aim of strengthening, but not guaranteeing, the protection of customers and the financial system. Supervisors' continuing supervision of financial institutions is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of information by way of reports obtained from skilled persons, visits to firms and regular meetings with management to discuss issues such as performance, risk management and strategy. In general, regulators have an outcome-focused regulatory approach that involves proactive enforcement and penalties for infringement. As a result, we face increased supervisory intrusion and scrutiny (resulting in increasing internal compliance costs and supervision fees), and in the event of a breach of our regulatory obligations we are likely to face more stringent regulatory fines.\nSome of the regulators focus strongly on consumer protection and on conduct risk. This has included a focus on the design and operation of products, the behavior of customers and the operation of markets. Some of the laws in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate give regulators the power to make temporary product intervention rules either to improve a company's systems and controls in relation to product design, product management and implementation, or address problems identified with financial products. These problems may potentially cause significant detriment to consumers because of certain product features, governance flaws or distribution strategies. Such rules may prevent institutions from entering into product agreements with customers until such problems have been solved. Some regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate also require us to be in compliance with training, authorization and supervision of personnel, systems, processes and documentation requirements. Sales practices with retail customers, including incentive compensation structures related to such practices, have recently been a focus of various regulatory and governmental agencies. If we fail to be compliant with such regulations, there would be a risk of an adverse impact on our business from sanctions, fines or other actions imposed by regulatory authorities.\nWe are exposed to risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings.\nAs noted above, we face risk of loss from legal and regulatory proceedings, including tax proceedings that could subject us to monetary judgments, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties. The current regulatory environment reflects an increased supervisory focus on enforcement, combined with uncertainty about the evolution of the regulatory regime, and may lead to material operational and compliance costs. In general, amounts financial institutions pay in settlements of regulatory proceedings or investigations and the severity of terms of regulatory settlements have been increasing. In certain cases, regulatory authorities have required criminal pleas, admissions of wrongdoing, limitations on asset growth, managerial changes, and other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, all of which could have significant economic consequences for a financial institution.\nWe are subject to civil and tax claims and party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business from time to time, including in connection with lending activities, relationships with our employees and other commercial or tax matters. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly when the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or when the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in the early stages of investigation or discovery, we cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be. We believe that we have established adequate reserves related to the costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with these various claims and legal proceedings. However, the amount of these provisions is substantially less than the total amount of the claims asserted against us and, in light of the uncertainties involved in such claims and proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have currently accrued. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and our level of income for that period.\nIn addition, from time to time, the Company is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by the SEC and law enforcement authorities.\nOften, the announcement or other publication of claims or actions that may arise from such litigation and regulatory proceedings or of any related settlement may spur the initiation of similar claims by other customers, clients or governmental entities. In any such claim or action, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us and may result in financial liability, changes in our business practices or an adverse effect on our reputation or client demand for our products and services. In regulatory settlements since the financial crisis, fines imposed by regulators have increased substantially and may in some cases exceed the profit earned or harm caused by the breach.\nRegular and ongoing inspection by our banking and other regulators may result in the need to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices. Such remedial actions may entail significant costs, management attention, and systems development, and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until those remedial actions are completed. In some instances, we are subjected to significant legal restrictions on our ability to disclose these types of actions or the full detail of these actions publicly. Our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and timeframe deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with that regulatory authority and lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions.\nThe magnitude and complexity of projects required to address the Company\u2019s regulatory and legal proceedings, in addition to the challenging macroeconomic environment and pace of regulatory change, may result in execution risk and adversely affect the successful execution of such regulatory or legal priorities.\nIn many cases, we are required to self-report inappropriate or non-compliant conduct to regulatory authorities, and our failure to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation. Even when we promptly bring matters to the attention of appropriate authorities, we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines, liabilities to clients, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects in connection with self-reported matters.\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel, and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. Emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, could limit our ability to track the movement of funds. Our ability to comply with legal requirements depends on our ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability.\nThese require implementing and embedding effective controls and monitoring within our business and on-going changes to systems and operations. Financial crime is continually evolving and subject to increasingly stringent regulatory oversight and focus. Even known threats can never be fully eliminated, and there will be instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering or other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the relevant government agencies to which we report have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on us. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or other illegal or improper purposes.\nWhile we review our relevant counterparties\u2019 internal policies and procedures with respect to such matters, to a large degree we rely on our counterparties to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate anti-money laundering procedures. Such measures, procedures and compliance may not be completely effective in preventing third parties from using our and our counterparties\u2019 services as conduits for money laundering (including illegal cash operations) or other illegal activities without our and our counterparties\u2019 knowledge. If we are associated with, or even accused of being associated with, or become a party to, money laundering or other illegal activities, our reputation could suffer and/or we could become subject to fines, sanctions and/or legal enforcement (including being added to any \u201cblacklists\u201d that would prohibit certain parties from engaging in transactions with us), any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn incorrect interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely affect us.\nThe preparation of our tax returns requires the use of estimates and interpretations of complex tax laws and regulations, and is subject to review by taxing authorities. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States and certain foreign countries. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and relevant governmental taxing authorities, which are sometimes subject to prolonged evaluation periods until a final resolution is reached. In establishing a provision for income tax expense and filing returns, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. If the judgments, estimates, and assumptions we use in preparing our tax returns are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in taxes and other assessments may adversely affect us.\nThe legislatures and tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate regularly enact reforms to the tax and other assessment regimes to which we and our customers are subject. Such reforms include changes in the rate of assessments and, occasionally, enactment of temporary taxes, the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes. The effects of these changes and any other changes that result from enactment of additional tax reforms cannot be quantified and there can be no assurance that such reforms would not have an adverse effect upon our business. Aspects of recent U.S. federal income tax reform such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limit or eliminate certain income tax deductions, including the home mortgage interest deduction, the deduction of interest on home equity loans and a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes. These limitations and eliminations could affect demand for some of our retail banking products and the valuation of assets securing certain of our loans adversely, increasing our credit loss expense and reducing profitability.\nCredit Risks\nIf the level of our NPLs increases or our credit quality deteriorates in the future, or if our loan and lease loss reserves are insufficient to cover loan and lease losses, this could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of our businesses. Non-performing or low credit quality loans have in the past negatively impacted and can continue to\nnegatively impact our results of operations. In particular, the amount of our reported NPLs may increase in the future as a result of growth in our total loan portfolio, including as a result of loan portfolios we may acquire in the future, or factors beyond our control, such as adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in economic conditions in the United States, the impact of political events, events affecting certain industries or events affecting financial markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively control the level of the NPLs in our loan portfolio.\nOur loan and lease loss reserves are based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio. These factors include, among other things, our borrowers\u2019 financial condition, repayment abilities and repayment intentions, the realizable value of any collateral, the prospects for support from any guarantor, government macroeconomic policies, interest rates and the legal and regulatory environment. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result, there is no precise method for predicting loan and credit losses, and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses. If our assessment of and expectations concerning the above-mentioned factors differ from actual developments, if the quality of our total loan portfolio deteriorates for any reason, including an increase in lending to individuals and small and medium enterprises, a volume increase in our credit card portfolio or the introduction of new products, or if future actual losses exceed our estimates of expected losses, we may be required to increase our loan and lease loss reserves, which may adversely affect us. If we were unable to control or reduce the level of our non-performing or poor credit quality loans, this also could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, the FASB\u2019s ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2020 and increased our ACL by approximately $2.5 billion. This standard replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost. As a result of the adoption of this standard, companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management\u2019s estimate of credit losses over the assets\u2019 remaining expected lives. It is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be impacted negatively as a result of the application of this ASU. See \u201cChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings\u201d below.\nOur loan and investment portfolios are subject to risk of prepayment, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur fixed-rate loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a borrower or issuer to pay a debt obligation prior to maturity. Generally, in a low interest rate environment, prepayment activity increases, and this reduces the weighted average life of our earning assets and could have a material adverse effect on us. We would also be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on credit card and collateralized mortgage loans, since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these assets, which may result in a mismatch in our funding obligations and reinvestment at lower yields. Prepayment risk is inherent in our commercial activity, and an increase in prepayments could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe value of the collateral securing our loans may not be sufficient, and we may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio.\nThe value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond our control, including macroeconomic factors affecting the United States. The value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may be adversely affected by force majeure events such as natural disasters, particularly in locations in which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is composed of real estate loans. Natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods may cause widespread damage, which could impair the asset quality of our loan portfolio and have an adverse impact on the economy of the affected region. We also may not have sufficiently recent information on the value of collateral, which may result in an inaccurate assessment of impairment losses of our loans secured by such collateral. If any of the above were to occur, we may need to make additional provisions to cover actual impairment losses on our loans, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, auto industry technology changes, accelerated by environmental rules, could affect our auto consumer business, particularly the residual values of leased vehicles, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk in our banking business.\nWe are exposed to counterparty risk in addition to credit risks associated with lending activities. Counterparty risk may arise from, for example, investing in securities of third parties, entering into derivatives contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us or executing securities, futures, currency or commodity trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries.\nWe routinely transact with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional clients. We rely on information provided by or on behalf of counterparties, such as financial statements, and we may rely on representations of our counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Defaults by, and even rumors or questions about the solvency of, certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions. Many routine transactions we enter into expose us to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of our significant counterparties.\nLiquidity and Financing Risks\nLiquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we either do not have available sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they become due or can secure them only at excessive cost. This risk is inherent in any retail and commercial banking business and can be heightened by a number of enterprise-specific factors, including over-reliance on a particular source of funding, changes in credit ratings or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation. While we implement liquidity management processes to seek to mitigate and control these risks, unforeseen systemic market factors in particular make it difficult to eliminate these risks completely. Adverse and continued constraints in the supply of liquidity, including inter-bank lending, may materially and adversely affect the cost of funding our business, and extreme liquidity constraints may affect our current operations and our ability to fulfill regulatory liquidity requirements as well as limit growth possibilities.\nOur cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and our credit spreads. Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of our funding. Changes in our credit spreads are market-driven, and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. Changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile.\nIf wholesale markets financing ceases to be available, or becomes excessively expensive, we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits, with a view to attracting more customers, and/or to sell assets, potentially at depressed prices. The persistence or worsening of these adverse market conditions or an increase in base interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access liquidity and cost of funding.\nWe rely, and will continue to rely, primarily on deposits to fund lending activities. The ongoing availability of this type of funding is sensitive to a variety of factors outside our control, such as general economic conditions and the confidence of depositors in the economy in general, and the financial services industry in particular, as well as competition among banks for deposits. Any of these factors could significantly increase the amount of deposit withdrawals in a short period of time, thereby reducing our ability to access deposit funding in the future on appropriate terms, or at all. If these circumstances were to arise, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe anticipate that our customers will continue to make deposits (particularly demand deposits and short-term time deposits) in the near future, and we intend to maintain our emphasis on the use of banking deposits as a source of funds. The short-term nature of some deposits could cause liquidity problems for us in the future if deposits are not made in the volumes we expect or are not renewed. If a substantial number of our depositors withdraw their demand deposits, or do not roll over their time deposits upon maturity, we may be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that, in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system, we will be able to maintain levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments, or the liquidation of certain assets. If this were to happen, we could be materially adversely affected.\nCredit, market and liquidity risk may have an adverse effect on our credit ratings and our cost of funds. Any downgrading in our credit rating would likely increase our cost of funding, require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts and adversely affect our interest margins and results of operations.\nCredit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.\nAny downgrade in our or Santander's debt credit ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs and require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivatives contracts, and could limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our commercial business. For example, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our products, engage in certain longer-term and derivatives transactions and retain customers, particularly customers who need a minimum rating threshold in order to invest. In addition, under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts, we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or terminate the contracts. Any of these results of a ratings downgrade, in turn, could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on us, including our operating results and financial condition.\nWe conduct a significant number of our material derivatives activities through Santander and Santander UK. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2020, if all of the rating agencies were to downgrade Santander\u2019s or Santander UK\u2019s long-term senior debt ratings, we would be required to post additional collateral pursuant to derivatives and other financial contracts. Refer to further discussion in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhile certain potential impacts of these downgrades are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain, as they depend on numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including market conditions at the time of any downgrade, whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit rating precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit rating, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. Actual outflows could be higher or lower than this hypothetical example depending on certain factors, including which credit rating agency downgrades our credit rating, any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce cash outflows and the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding (such as from money market funds) or loss of secured funding capacity. Although unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in our stress testing scenarios and a portion of our total liquid assets is held against these risks, it is still the case that a credit rating downgrade could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Bank, and SC.\nIn addition, if we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace those contracts, our market risk profile could be altered.\nThere can be no assurance that the rating agencies will maintain their current ratings or outlooks. In general, the future evolution of our ratings will be linked, to a large extent, to the macroeconomic outlook and to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our asset quality, profitability and capital. Failure to maintain favorable ratings and outlooks could increase the cost of funding and adversely affect interest margins, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMarket Risks\nWe are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and other market risks, which may materially and adversely affect us.\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in our net interest income or in the market value of our assets and liabilities due to volatility of interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices. Changes in interest rates affect the following areas, of our business, among others:\n\u2022net interest income;\n\u2022the volume of loans originated;\n\u2022the market value of our securities holdings;\n\u2022the value of our loans and deposits;\n\u2022gains from sales of loans and securities; and\n\u2022gains and losses from derivatives.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including increased regulation of the financial sector, monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors. Variations in interest rates could affect our net interest income, which comprises the majority of our revenue, reducing our growth rate and potentially resulting in losses. This is a result of the different effect a change in interest rates may have on the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our borrowings. In addition, we may incur costs (which, in turn, will impact our results) as we implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce the volume of loans we originate. Sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets. Increases in interest rates may also reduce the propensity of our customers to prepay or refinance fixed-rate loans. Increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our financial assets and the collateral used to secure our loans, and may reduce gains or require us to record losses on sales of our loans or securities.\nIn addition, we may experience increased delinquencies in a low interest rate environment when such an environment is accompanied by high unemployment and recessionary conditions.\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies may negatively affect our earnings and value of our assets and securities.\nSome of our investment management services fees are based on financial market valuations of assets certain of our subsidiaries manage or hold in custody for clients. Changes in these valuations can affect noninterest income positively or negatively, and ultimately affect our financial results. Significant changes in the volume of activity in the capital markets, and in the number of assignments we are awarded, could also affect our financial results.\nWe are also exposed to equity price risk in our investments in equity securities. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of our investment and trading portfolios. The volatility of world equity markets due to economic uncertainty and sovereign debt concerns has had a particularly strong impact on the financial sector. Continued volatility may affect the value of our investments in equity securities and, depending on their fair value and future recovery expectations, could become a permanent impairment which would be subject to write-offs against our results. To the extent any of these risks materialize, our net interest income and the market value of our assets and liabilities could be materially adversely affected.\nMarket conditions have resulted, and could result, in material changes to the estimated fair values of our financial assets. Negative fair value adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, financial markets have been subject to volatility and the resulting widening of credit spreads. We have material exposures to securities and other investments that are recorded at fair value and are therefore exposed to potential negative fair value adjustments. Asset valuations in future periods, reflecting then-prevailing market conditions, may result in negative changes in the fair values of our financial assets, and also may translate into increased impairments. In addition, the value we ultimately realize on disposal of the asset may be lower than its current fair value. Any of these factors could require us to record negative fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, to the extent fair values are determined using financial valuation models, such values may be inaccurate or subject to change, as the data used by such models may not be available or may become unavailable due to changes in market conditions, particularly for illiquid assets and in times of economic instability. In such circumstances, our valuation methodologies require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates in order to establish fair value, and reliable assumptions are difficult to make and are inherently uncertain. In addition, valuation models are complex, making them inherently imperfect predictors of actual results. Any resulting impairments or write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to market, operational and other related risks associated with our derivatives transactions that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe enter into derivatives transactions for trading purposes as well as for hedging purposes. We are subject to market, credit and operational risks associated with these transactions, including basis risk (the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost) and credit or default risk (the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder, including providing sufficient collateral).\nThe execution and performance of derivatives transactions depend on our ability to maintain adequate control and administration systems and to hire and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, our ability to adequately monitor, analyze and report derivatives transactions continues to depend, to a great extent, on our IT systems. These factors further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivatives contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause us to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair our ability to manage our risk exposure from these products.\nRisk Management\nFailure to successfully implement and continue to improve our risk management policies, procedures and methods, including our credit risk management system, could materially and adversely affect us, and we may be exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nThe management of risk is an integral part of our activities. We seek to monitor and manage our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, market, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. Although we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.\nSome of our qualitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based on our use of observed historical market behavior. We apply statistical and other tools to these observations to arrive at quantifications of our risk exposures. These qualitative tools and metrics may fail to predict future risk exposures. These risk exposures could, for example, arise from factors we did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in our statistical models. This would limit our ability to manage our risks. Our losses therefore could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, our quantified modeling does not take all risks into account. Our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses. We could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions based on models that are poorly developed, implemented, or used, or as a result of a modeled outcome being misunderstood or used of for purposes for which it was not designed. In addition, if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate, they could take their business elsewhere or seek to limit transactions with us. This could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nAs a commercial bank, one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk. For example, an important feature of our credit risk management is to employ an internal credit rating system to assess the particular risk profile of a customer. Since this process involves detailed analyses of the customer, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors, it is subject to human and IT systems errors. In exercising their judgment on the current and future credit risk of our customers, our employees may not always assign an accurate credit rating, which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system.\nWe have been refining our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers. However, we may not be able to timely detect all possible risks before they occur or, due to limited tools available to us, our employees may not be able to implement them effectively, which may increase our credit risk. Failure to effectively implement, consistently follow or continuously refine our credit risk management system may result in an increase in the level of NPLs and a higher risk exposure for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nThe financial problems our customers face could adversely affect us.\nMarket turmoil and economic recession could materially and adversely affect the liquidity, businesses and/or financial condition of our borrowers, which could in turn increase our NPL ratios, impair our loan and other financial assets and result in decreased demand for borrowings in general. In addition, our customers may further decrease their risk tolerance to non-deposit investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds significantly, which would adversely affect our fee and commission income. Any of the conditions described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased competition and industry consolidation may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition in all parts of our business from numerous banks and non-bank providers of financial services, including in originating loans and attracting deposits, providing customer service, the quality and range of products and services, technology, interest rates and overall reputation, and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify. Our competition comes principally from other domestic and foreign banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other lenders and purchasers of loans.\nThere has been a trend towards consolidation in the banking industry, which has created larger and stronger banks with which we must now compete. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages such as a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, lower-cost funding and larger branch networks. Many competitors are also focused on cross-selling their products, which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits. There can be no assurance that increased competition will not adversely affect our growth prospects and therefore our operations. We also face competition from non-bank competitors such as brokerage companies, department stores (for some credit products), leasing and factoring companies, mutual fund and pension fund management companies and insurance companies.\nNon-traditional providers of banking services, such as financial technology companies, internet based e-commerce providers, mobile telephone companies and internet search engines, may offer and/or increase their offerings of financial products and services directly to customers. These non-traditional providers of banking services currently have an advantage over traditional providers because they are not subject to the same regulatory or legislative requirements to which we are subject. Several of these competitors may have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may adopt more aggressive pricing and rates and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure and marketing.\nNew competitors may enter the market or existing competitors may adjust their services with unique product or service offerings or approaches to providing banking services. If we are unable to compete successfully with current and new competitors, or if we are unable to anticipate and adapt our offerings to changing banking industry trends, including technological changes, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, our failure to anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in customer behavior effectively, including among younger customers, could delay or prevent our access to new digital-based markets, which would in turn have an adverse effect on our competitive position and business. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we continue to grow our internet and mobile banking capabilities. Our customers may choose to conduct business or offer products in areas that may be considered speculative or risky. Such new technologies and the rise in customer use of internet and mobile banking platforms in recent years could negatively impact our investments in bank premises, equipment and personnel for our branch network. The persistence or acceleration of this shift in demand towards internet and mobile banking may necessitate changes to our retail distribution strategy, which may include closing and/or selling certain branches and restructuring our remaining branches and workforce. These actions could lead to losses on these assets and increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of our remaining branches or otherwise reform our retail distribution channel. Furthermore, our failure to keep pace with innovation or to swiftly and effectively implement such changes to our distribution strategy could have an adverse effect on our competitive position.\nIncreasing competition could also require that we increase the rates we offer on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It may also negatively affect our business results and prospects by, among other things, limiting our ability to increase our customer base and expand our operations and increasing competition for investment opportunities.\nIf our customer service levels were perceived by the market to be materially below those of our competitors, we could lose existing and potential business. If we are not successful in retaining and strengthening customer relationships, we may lose market share, incur losses on some or all of our activities or fail to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill impairments may be required in relation to acquired businesses.\nWe have made business acquisitions for which it is possible that the goodwill which has been attributed to those businesses may have to be written down if our valuation assumptions are required to be reassessed as a result of any deterioration in the business\u2019 underlying profitability, asset quality or other relevant matters. Impairment testing with respect to goodwill is performed annually, more frequently if impairment indicators are present, and includes a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, the impairment is measured as this excess of carrying value over fair value. We did not recognize any impairments of goodwill in 2018 or 2019, but did record a goodwill impairment of $1.8 billion in 2020. Based on future market conditions and the Company's financial performance, it is possible we may be required to record additional impairment of goodwill up to $2.6 billion attributable to SC and SBNA in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not have to write down the value attributed to goodwill further in the future, which would not impact risk-based capital ratios adversely, but would adversely affect our results of operations and stockholder's equity.\nWe rely on recruiting, retaining and developing appropriate senior management and skilled personnel.\nOur continued success depends in part on the continued service of key members of our management team. The ability to continue to attract, train, motivate and retain highly qualified professionals is a key element of our strategy. The successful implementation of our growth strategy depends on the availability of skilled management, both at our head office and at each of our business units. If we or one of our business units or other functions fails to staff its operations appropriately or loses one or more of its key senior executives and fails to replace them in a satisfactory and timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations, including control and operational risks, may be adversely affected.\nThe financial industry in the United States has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees. In addition, due to our relationship with Santander, we are subject to indirect regulation by the European Central Bank, which has recently imposed compensation restrictions that may apply to certain of our executive officers and other employees under the CRD IV prudential rules. These restrictions may impact our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could cause harm to our business prospects.\nMaintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees and conducting business transactions with our counterparties. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, dealing with sectors that are not well perceived by the public (e.g., weapons industries), dealing with customers on sanctions lists, ratings downgrades, compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities of customers and counterparties, including activities that affect the environment negatively. Further, adverse publicity, regulatory actions or fines, litigation, operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of, or individuals in, the industry can also affect our reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis and increased regulatory supervision and enforcement have caused public perception of us and others in the financial services industry to decline. Activists increasingly target financial services firms with criticism for relationships with clients engaged in businesses whose products are perceived to be harmful to the health of customers, or whose activities are perceived to affect public safety affect the environment, climate or workers\u2019 rights negatively. Such criticism could increase dissatisfaction among customers, investors and employees of the Company and damage the Company\u2019s reputation. Alternatively, yielding to such activism could damage the Company\u2019s reputation with groups whose views are not aligned with those of the activists. In either case, certain clients and customers may cease to do business with the Company, and the Company\u2019s ability to attract new clients and customers may be diminished.\nPreserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify, understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations.\nWe could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest properly. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions against us. Therefore, there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.\nWhile negative public opinion once was primarily a response to adverse coverage in traditional news media, increased use of social media platforms has resulted in rapid dissemination of information and misinformation, which can magnify potential harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. We may be the subject of misinformation and misrepresentations propagated deliberately to harm our reputation or for other deceitful purposes, including by others seeking to gain an illegal market advantage by spreading false information about us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to neutralize or contain false information that may be propagated regarding the Company, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects effectively.\nFraudulent activity associated with our products or networks could cause us to suffer reputational damage, the use of our products to decrease and our fraud losses to be materially adversely affected. We are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants, customers and other third parties handling customer information. The risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general. Credit and debit card fraud, identity theft and related crimes are prevalent, and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated. Our resources, customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may not be sufficient to accurately predict or prevent fraud. Additionally, our fraud risk continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches and we expand our direct banking business and introduce new products and features. Our financial condition, the level of our fraud charge-offs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to increase significantly. High-profile fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention and reputational and financial damage to our brands, which could negatively impact the use of our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank engages in transactions with its subsidiaries or affiliates that others may not consider to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\nThe Bank and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of services agreements pursuant to which we render services, such as administrative, accounting, finance, treasury, legal services and others.\nUnited States law applicable to certain financial institutions, including the Bank and other Santander entities and offices in the U.S., establish several procedures designed to ensure that the transactions entered into with or among our subsidiaries and/or affiliates do not deviate from prevailing market conditions for those types of transactions.\nThe Bank and its affiliates are likely to continue to engage in transactions with their respective affiliates. Future conflicts of interests among our affiliates may arise, which conflicts are not required to be and may not be resolved in SHUSA's favor.\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nAny failure to effectively maintain, secure, improve or upgrade our IT infrastructure and management information systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to maintain, protect and upgrade our IT on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must continually make significant investments and improvements in our IT infrastructure in order to remain competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of capital expenditures necessary to support the improvement or upgrading of our IT infrastructure in the future. Any failure to improve or upgrade our IT infrastructure and management information systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks relating to data collection, processing, storage systems and security are inherent in our business.\nLike other financial institutions with a large customer base, we have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the subject of attempted cyberattacks in light of the fact that we manage and hold confidential personal information of customers in the conduct of our banking operations, as well as a large number of assets. Our business depends on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately, and on our ability to rely on our digital technologies, computer and e-mail services, spreadsheets, software and networks, as well as on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. The proper functioning of financial controls, accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively. Losses can result from inadequate personnel, inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems, or external events that interrupt normal business operations. We also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures proves to be inadequate or is circumvented. Although we work with our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and prevent information security risk, we routinely exchange personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means, which may be a target for attempted cyberattacks. This is especially applicable in the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift we have experienced in having a significant part of our employees working from their homes for the time being, as our employees access our secure networks through their home networks. If we cannot maintain effective and secure electronic data and information, management and processing systems or if we fail to maintain complete physical and electronic records, this could result in disruptions to our operations, claims from customers, regulators, employees and other parties, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory sanctions and serious reputational and financial harm to us.\nMany companies across the country and in the financial services industry have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems. Cybersecurity risks have increased significantly in recent years due to the development and proliferation of new technologies, increased use of the internet and telecommunications technology to conduct financial transactions, and increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, state-sponsored and individual hackers, terrorist organizations, disgruntled employees and vendors, activists and other third parties. Financial institutions, the government and retailers have in recent years reported cyber incidents that compromised data, resulted in the theft of funds or the theft or destruction of corporate information and other assets.\nWe take protective measures and continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. We have policies, practices and controls designed to prevent or limit disruptions to our systems and enhance the security of our infrastructure. These include performing risk management for information systems that store, transmit or process information assets identifying and managing risks to information assets managed by third-party service providers through on-going oversight and auditing of the service providers\u2019 operations and controls. We develop controls regarding user access to software on the principle that access is forbidden to a system unless expressly permitted, limited to the minimum amount necessary for business purposes, and terminated promptly when access is no longer required. We seek to educate and make our employees aware of information security and privacy controls and their specific responsibilities on an ongoing basis.\nNevertheless, while we have not experienced material losses or other material consequences relating to cyberattacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, our systems, software and networks, as well as those of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyberattacks such as denial of service, malware, ransomware, phishing, and other events that could result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of significant amounts of personal, proprietary or confidential information of our customers, employees, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on our systems, or result in the theft or loss of significant levels of liquid assets, including cash. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase in sophistication, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our policies, practices and controls to protect against all such circumstances that could result in disruptions to our systems. This is because, among other reasons, the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently, cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, and third parties may seek to gain access to our systems either directly or by using equipment or passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other authorized users of our systems. In the event of a cyberattack or security breach affecting a vendor or other third party entity on whom we rely, our ability to conduct business, and the security of our customer information, could be impaired in a manner to that of a cyberattack or security breach affecting us directly. We also may not receive information or notice of the breach in a timely manner, or we may have limited options to influence how and when the cyberattack or security breach is addressed.\nAs financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, they may be increasingly susceptible to negative consequences of cyberattacks and security breaches affecting the systems of such third parties. It could take a significant amount of time for a cyberattack to be investigated, during which time we may not be in a position to fully understand and remediate the attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences associated with a particular cyberattack. The perception of a security breach affecting us or any part of the financial services industry, whether correct or not, could result in a loss of confidence in our cybersecurity measures or otherwise damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Should such adverse events occur, we may not have indemnification or other protection from the third party sufficient to compensate or protect us from the consequences.\nAs attempted cyberattacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures against such attacks to investigate or remediate any vulnerability or resulting breach, or in communicating cyberattacks to our customers. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or third party or a cyberattack could result in our inability to recover or restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, damage to our systems and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, or other significant disruption of operations, including disruptions in our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems and our ability to communicate with and perform transactions with customers, vendors and other parties. These effects could be exacerbated if we would need to shut down portions of our technology infrastructure temporarily to address a cyberattack, if our technology infrastructure is not sufficiently redundant to meet our business needs while an aspect of our technology is compromised, or if a technological or other solution to a cyberattack is slow to be developed. Even if we timely resolve the technological issues in a cyberattack, a temporary disruption in our operations could adversely affect customer satisfaction and behavior, expose us to reputational damage, contractual claims, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, or litigation.\nU.S. banking agencies and other federal and state government agencies have increased their attention on cybersecurity and data privacy risks, and have proposed enhanced risk management standards that would apply to us. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect on January 1, 2020, requires, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data, and imposes increased privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of individuals. Such legislation and regulations relating to cybersecurity and data privacy may require that we modify systems, change service providers, or alter business practices or policies regarding information security, handling of data and privacy. Changes such as these could subject us to heightened operational costs. To the extent we do not successfully meet supervisory standards pertaining to cybersecurity, we could be subject to supervisory actions, litigation and reputational damage or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.\nRisks Associated with our Majority-Owned Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe financial results of SC could have a negative impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nSC historically has provided a significant source of funding to the Company through earnings. Our investment in SC involves risk, including the possibility that poor operating results of SC could negatively affect the operating results of SHUSA.\nFactors that affect the financial results of SC in addition to those which have been previously addressed include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Periods of economic slowdown may result in decreased demand for automobiles as well as declining values of automobiles and other consumer products used as collateral to secure outstanding loans. Higher gasoline prices, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors which impact consumer confidence could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown, servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in finance charge income. Changes in the economy may impact the collateral value of repossessed automobiles and repossession, and foreclosure sales may not yield sufficient proceeds to repay the receivables in full and result in losses.\n\u2022SC\u2019s growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are outside its control, including general economic conditions, the ability to obtain adequate financing for growth, laws and regulatory environments in the states in which the business seeks to operate, competition in new markets, the ability to attract new customers, the ability to recruit qualified personnel, and the ability to obtain and maintain all required approvals, permits, and licenses on a timely basis.\n\u2022Our relationship with FCA is a significant source of our loan and lease originations. Loss of our relationship with FCA, including as a result of termination of our agreement with FCA, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022SC\u2019s business may be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships that correlate to SC\u2019s ability to acquire loans and automotive leases. In addition, economic downturns may result in the closure of dealerships and corresponding decreases in sales and loan volumes.\n\u2022SC's business could be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining its serviced for others portfolio. As this is a significant and growing portion of SC's business strategy, if an institution for which SC currently services assets chooses to terminate SC's rights as a servicer or if SC fails to add additional institutions or portfolios to its servicing platform, SC may not achieve the desired revenue or income from this platform.\n\u2022SC has repurchase obligations in its capacity as a servicer in securitizations and whole loan sales. If significant repurchases of assets or other payments are required under its responsibility as a servicer, this could have a material adverse effect on SC\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\n\u2022The obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which increases the costs of SC's operations and may divert focus from business operations. As a result of its IPO, SC is now required to remain in compliance with the reporting requirements of the SEC and the NYSE, maintain corporate infrastructure required of a public company, and incur significant legal and financial compliance costs, which may divert SC management\u2019s attention and resources from implementing its growth strategy.\n\u2022The market price of SC Common Stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in SC Common Stock to decline. Conditions affecting the market price of SC Common Stock may be beyond SC\u2019s control and include general market conditions, economic factors, actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results, changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations related to future financial performance, analysts\u2019 estimates of SC\u2019s financial performance or lack of research or reports by industry analysts, changes in market valuations of similar companies, future sales of SC Common Stock, or additions or departures of its key personnel.\n\u2022SC's business and results of operations could be negatively impacted if it fails to manage and complete divestitures. SC regularly evaluates its portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer be aligned with its strategic objectives. When SC decides to sell assets or a business, it may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. SC may also experience greater costs and synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on revenue may be larger than projected. Additionally, SC may ultimately dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than those it had originally anticipated. After reaching a definitive agreement with a buyer, SC typically must satisfy pre-closing conditions and the completion of the transaction may be subject to regulatory and governmental approvals. Failure of these conditions and approvals to be satisfied or obtained may prevent SC from completing the transaction. Divestitures involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. SC continues to classify loans from its Bluestem portfolio as held-for-sale with a carrying value of approximately $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. SC remains a party to agreements with Bluestem that obligate it to, among other things, purchase new advances originated by Bluestem, along with existing balances on accounts with new advances through April 2022. Both parties have the right to terminate this agreement upon written notice if certain events were to occur, including if there is a material adverse change in the financial reporting condition of either party. Although SC is seeking a third party willing and able to take on this obligation, it may not be successful in finding such a party, and Bluestem may not agree to the substitution. SC has recorded significant lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio and may continue to do so as long as the portfolio is held, particularly due to the new volume it is committed to purchase. Until SC finds a third party to assume this obligation, there is a risk that material changes to its relationship with Bluestem, or the loss or discontinuance of Bluestem\u2019s business, would materially and adversely affect SC\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022SC's business could be negatively impacted if access to funding is reduced. Adverse changes in SC's ABS program or in the ABS market generally could materially adversely affect its ability to securitize loans on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to SC. This could increase its cost of funding, reduce its margins, or cause it to hold assets until investor demand improves.\n\u2022As with SHUSA, adverse outcomes to current and future litigation against SC may negatively impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations, and liquidity. SC is party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. In particular, as a consumer finance company, it is subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties. Some litigation against it could take the form of class action complaints by consumers. As the assignee of loans originated by automotive dealers, it also may be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against automotive dealers.\nThe Chrysler Agreement may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement. If SC fails to meet certain of these performance conditions, FCA may seek to terminate the agreement. In addition, FCA has the option to acquire an equity participation in the Chrysler Capital portion of SC's business.\nIn February 2013, SC entered into the Chrysler Agreement with FCA through which SC launched the Chrysler Capital brand in May 2013. Through the Chrysler Capital brand, SC originates private-label loans and leases to facilitate the purchase of FCA vehicles by consumers and FCA-franchised automotive dealers. The financing services SC provides under the Chrysler Agreement include providing (1) credit lines to finance FCA-franchised dealers\u2019 acquisitions of vehicles and other products FCA sells or distributes, (2) automotive loans and leases to finance consumer acquisitions of new and used vehicles at FCA-franchised dealerships, (3) financing for commercial and fleet customers, and (4) ancillary services. In addition, SC may facilitate, for an affiliate, offerings to dealers for dealer loan financing, construction loans, real estate loans, working capital loans, and revolving lines of credit. On June 28, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment of the Chrysler Agreement which modified the Chrysler Agreement to, among other things, adjust certain performance metrics, exclusivity commitments and payment provisions.\nIn May 2013, in accordance with the terms of the Chrysler Agreement, SC paid FCA a $150 million upfront, nonrefundable payment, to be amortized over ten years. In addition, in June 2019, in connection with the execution of the amendment to the Chrysler Agreement, SC paid a $60 million upfront fee to FCA. The unamortized portion would be recognized as expense immediately if the Chrysler Agreement were terminated in accordance with its terms.\nAs part of the Chrysler Agreement, SC received limited exclusivity rights to participate in specified minimum percentages of certain of FCA's financing incentive programs, which include loan rate subvention and automotive lease residual support subvention. Among other covenants, SC has committed to certain revenue sharing arrangements. SC bears the risk of loss on loans originated pursuant to the Chrysler Agreement, while FCA shares in any residual gains and losses in respect of automotive leases, subject to specific provisions in the Chrysler Agreement, including limitations on SC\u2019s participation in such gains and losses.\nThe Chrysler Agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including SC's failure to meet certain key performance metrics, provided FCA treats SC in a manner consistent with other comparable OEMs. FCA may also terminate the agreement if, among other circumstances, (i) a person other than Santander and its affiliates or SC's other stockholders owns 20% or more of SC Common Stock and Santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person, (ii) SC controls, or becomes controlled by, an OEM that competes with FCA or (iii) certain of SC\u2019s credit facilities become impaired. In addition, under the Chrysler Agreement, FCA has the option to acquire, for fair market value, an equity participation in the business offering and providing the financial services contemplated by the Chrysler Agreement. There is no maximum limit on the size of FCA\u2019s potential equity participation. Although the Chrysler Agreement contains provisions that are designed to address a situation in which the parties disagree on the fair market value of the equity participation interest, there is a risk that SC ultimately receives less than what it believes to be the fair market value for such interest, and the loss of its associated revenue and profits may not be offset fully by the immediate proceeds for such interest. There can be no assurance that SC would be able to re-deploy the immediate proceeds for such interest in other businesses or investments that would provide comparable returns, thereby reducing SC\u2019s profitability.\nSC\u2019s ability to realize the full strategic and financial benefits of its relationship with FCA depends in part on the successful development of its Chrysler Capital business, which requires a significant amount of management's time and effort as well as the success of FCA's business. If FCA exercises its equity option, if the Chrysler Agreement (or FCA's limited exclusivity obligations thereunder) were to terminate, or if SC otherwise is unable to realize the expected benefits of its relationship with FCA, including as a result of FCA's bankruptcy or loss of business, there could be a materially adverse impact to SHUSA's and SC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, loan and lease volume, the credit quality of SHUSA's and SC\u2019s portfolio, liquidity, reputation, funding costs and growth, and SHUSA's and SC's ability to obtain or find other OEM relationships or to otherwise implement our business strategy could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nMacro-Economic and Political Risks\nDevelopments stemming from the U.K. withdrawal from the EU could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU may have negative effects on global economic conditions and global financial markets. The EU and the U.K. recently signed the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which provides a basic framework for free trade in goods and cooperation in certain policy areas; however, there are many aspects pertaining to trade and cooperation between the EU and the U.K. that remain subject to negotiation and there is still uncertainty about the long-term relationship between the EU and the U.K. and whether the U.K. will replicate or replace certain EU laws. The U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU has contributed to political and economic uncertainty in the U.K. and may contribute to such environments in EU member states. Such political and economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on economic conditions and the stability of financial markets in the U.K., and could significantly reduce market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. While the Company does not maintain a presence in the U.K., political and economic uncertainty in countries with significant economies and relationships to the global financial industry have in the past led to declines in market liquidity and activity levels, volatile market conditions, a contraction of available credit, lower or negative interest rates, weaker economic growth and reduced business confidence on an international level, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe depend in part upon dividends and other funds from subsidiaries.\nMost of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay dividends, to the extent we decide to do so, depends in part on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and pay dividends to us. Payment of dividends, distributions and advances by our subsidiaries will be contingent on our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations, and are limited by legal and regulatory restrictions. Additionally, our right to receive any assets of our subsidiaries as an equity holder of such subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends, in part, on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties, and we may not be able to manage various risks we face as we expand our range of products and services that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our operations and our profitability depend, in part, on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that our new products and services will be responsive to client demands or successful once they are offered to our clients, or that they will be successful in the future. In addition, our clients\u2019 needs or desires may change over time, and such changes may render our products and services obsolete, outdated or unattractive, and we may not be able to develop new products that meet our clients\u2019 changing needs. Our success is also dependent on our ability to anticipate and leverage new and existing technologies that may have an impact on products and services in the banking industry. Technological changes may further intensify and complicate the competitive landscape and influence client behavior. If we cannot respond in a timely fashion to the changing needs of our clients, we may lose clients, which could in turn materially and adversely affect us.\nThe introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our clients and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices. Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to the enhanced risk of operational lapses, which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine whether initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients. Failure to manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the cost of developing products that are not launched is likely to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any or all of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties for important products and services.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as loan and deposit servicing systems, internet connections and network access. Third parties can be sources of operational risk to us, including with respect to security breaches affecting those parties. We may be required to take steps to protect the integrity of our operational systems, thereby increasing our operational costs and potentially decreasing customer satisfaction. In addition, any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason, their performing their services poorly, or employee misconduct could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise to conduct business, which could lead to reputational damage and regulatory investigations and intervention. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delays and expense. Further, the operational and regulatory risk we face as a result of these arrangements may be increased to the extent that we restructure them. Any restructuring could involve significant expense to us and entail significant delivery and execution risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a third party obtains access to our customer information and that third party experiences a cyberattack or breach of its systems, this could result in several negative outcomes for us, including losses from fraudulent transactions, potential legal and regulatory liability and associated damages, penalties and restitution, increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the third party\u2019s security breach, and harm to our reputation from the perception that our systems or third-party systems or services that we rely on may not be secure.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, terrorist activities or international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor potential impact of disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions, pandemics, and other significant public health emergencies, dislocations, fires, explosions, or other catastrophic accidents or events), terrorist activities or international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities, preventing a subset of our employees from working for a prolonged period and otherwise preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies and defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning and our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that may occur. The adverse impact of disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal.\nFinancial Reporting and Control Risks\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe accounting standard setters and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations, as well as affect the calculation of our capital ratios. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nFor example, as noted in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, in June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The adoption of this standard resulted in the increase in the ACL of approximately $2.5 billion and a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of income taxes, at January 1, 2020. The estimated increase is based on forecasts of expected future economic conditions and is primarily driven by the fact that the allowance will cover expected credit losses over the full expected life of the loan portfolios. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s other financial instruments. Additionally, we elected to utilize regulatory relief which permitted us to phase in 25 percent of the capital impact of CECL in our calculation of regulatory capital amounts and ratios in 2020, and will permit us to phase in an additional 25 percent each subsequent year until fully phased-in by the first quarter of 2023.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if inaccurate, could cause material misstatement of the results of our operations and financial position.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. The accounting policies deemed critical to our results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgments and estimates, include impairment of loans and advances, goodwill impairment, valuation of financial instruments, impairment of available-for-sale financial assets, deferred tax assets and provisions for liabilities.\nThe ACL is a significant critical estimate. Due to the inherent nature of this estimate, we cannot provide assurance that the Company will not significantly increase the ACL or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance.\nThe valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value can be subjective, in particular when models are used which include unobservable inputs. Given the uncertainty and subjectivity associated with valuing such instruments it is possible that the results of our operations and financial position could be materially misstated if the estimates and assumptions used prove inaccurate.\nIf the judgments, estimates and assumptions we use in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are subsequently found to be incorrect, there could be a material effect on our results of operations and a corresponding effect on our funding requirements and capital ratios.\nDisclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud, and lapses in these controls could materially and adversely affect our operations, liquidity and/or reputation.\nDisclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We also maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting. However, these controls may not achieve their intended objectives. Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgement and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of these limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected, and that information may not be reported on a timely basis.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from material weaknesses in disclosure controls and processes over financial reporting in the future. If we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements and limit our ability to raise capital. Additionally, failure to remediate the material weaknesses or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to additional litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nFailure to satisfy obligations associated with public securities filings may have adverse regulatory, economic, and reputational consequences.\nIf we are not able to file our periodic reports within the time periods prescribed by the SEC, among other consequences, we would be unable to use Form S-3 registration statements until we have timely filed our SEC periodic reports for a period of 12 consecutive months. Our inability to use Form S-3 registration statements would increase the time and resources we need to spend if we choose to access the public capital markets.", "PERMNO": 10562, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STD2"}
