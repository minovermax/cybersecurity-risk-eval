{"cik": "1520566", "company": "Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as discussed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). These risk factors are important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different than we presently anticipate. Discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the Business and the MD&A sections. Below, we describe certain additional important business, industry, regulatory and legal risks.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nA significant increase in delinquencies for the loans we service could have a significant impact on our revenues, expenses and liquidity and on the valuation of our MSRs as follows.\n\u2022\nRevenue. An increase in delinquencies will result in lower revenue for loans we service for GSEs and Ginnie Mae because we only collect servicing fees from GSEs for performing loans. Additionally, while increased delinquencies generate higher ancillary revenues, including late fees, these fees are not likely to be recoverable in the event that the related loan is liquidated. In addition, an increase in delinquencies lowers the interest income we receive on cash held in collection and other accounts.\n\u2022\nExpenses. An increase in delinquencies will result in a higher cost to service due to the increased time and effort required to collect payments from delinquent borrowers and an increase in interest expense as a result of an increase in our advancing obligations.\n\u2022\nLiquidity. An increase in delinquencies could also negatively impact our liquidity because of an increase in borrowing under our advance facilities.\n\u2022\nValuation of MSRs. We base the price we pay for MSRs on, among other things, our projections of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. Our expectation of delinquencies is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections. If delinquencies were significantly greater than expected, the estimated fair value of our MSRs could be diminished. If the estimated fair value of MSRs is reduced, we could suffer a loss, which has a negative impact on our financial results.\nAn increase in delinquency rates could therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to continue to maintain the volumes in our loan originations business, which would adversely affect our ability to replenish our servicing business.\nThe volume of loans funded within our loan originations business is subject to multiple factors, including changes in interest rates, availability of government programs, relationships with realtors and builders and consumer credit. Volume in our originations business is based in large part on the refinancing of existing mortgage loans that we service, which is highly dependent on interest rates and government mortgage modification programs and may decline if interest rates increase or these programs are terminated. Because of the relationship-driven nature of our originations business our ability to secure and maintain relationships with real estate agents and builders will influence our ability to maintain our purchase money mortgage loan volume. If we are unable to maintain our loan originations volume then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to maintain or grow our business if we cannot acquire MSRs or enter into additional subservicing agreements on favorable terms.\nOur servicing portfolio is subject to \u201crun off,\u201d meaning that mortgage loans serviced by us may be prepaid prior to maturity, refinanced with a mortgage not serviced by us or liquidated through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other liquidation process or repaid through standard amortization of principal. As a result, our ability to maintain the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to acquire the right to service additional pools of residential mortgages or to originate additional mortgages.\nIn addition, the FHFA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has recommended enhanced oversight of transfers of MSRs to non-bank servicers such as us and has recommended that the GSEs develop a framework to mitigate financial and operational risks, including routine examinations, GSE reviews and capacity testing prior to MSR transfers.\nFurther, our attempts to acquire MSRs or enter into subservicing agreements may be blocked by regulators or courts. In the past, certain regulators have taken steps to block the acquisition of MSRs by one of our competitors. It is possible that we could become subject to similar actions with respect to our acquisition of MSRs or other key business operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result, we may not be able to acquire MSRs or enter into additional subservicing agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe service higher risk loans, which are more expensive to service than conventional mortgage loans.\nA certain percentage of the mortgage loans we service are higher risk loans, meaning that the loans are to less credit worthy borrowers or for properties the value of which has decreased. These loans are more expensive to service because they require more frequent interaction with customers and greater monitoring and oversight. Additionally, in connection with the ongoing mortgage market reform and regulatory developments, servicers of higher risk loans may be subject to increased scrutiny by state and federal regulators or may experience higher compliance costs, which could result in a further increase in servicing costs. We may not be able to pass along any of the additional expenses we incur in servicing higher risk loans to our servicing clients. The greater cost of servicing higher risk loans, which may be further increased through regulatory reform, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to make servicing advances that can be subject to delays in recovery or may not be recoverable in certain circumstances.\nDuring any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors, pay property taxes and insurance premiums, legal expenses and other protective advances. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors. As home values change, we may have to reconsider certain of the assumptions underlying our decisions to make advances, and in certain situations our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed. In addition, in the event a mortgage loan serviced by us defaults or becomes delinquent, the repayment to us of the advance may be delayed until the mortgage loan is repaid or refinanced or liquidation occurs. As a reverse mortgage servicer, we are also responsible for funding any draws due to borrowers in a timely manner, remitting to investors interest accrued and paying for interest shortfalls. Advances on reverse mortgages are typically greater than advances on forward residential mortgages. They are typically recovered upon weekly or monthly reimbursement or from sale in the market. In the event we receive requests for advances in excess of amounts we are able to fund, we may not be able to fund these advance requests, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations. A delay in our ability to collect an advance may adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for an advance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have sold to New Residential and certain third-party investors rights to mortgage servicing rights and servicer advances related to certain loan pools. In connection with the transaction, New Residential purchased the equity of wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries of Nationstar that issued limited recourse variable funding to finance the advances. We continue to service these loans. In the event that New Residential receives requests for advances in excess of amounts that New Residential or its co-investors are willing or able to fund, we are obligated to fund these advance requests. Since we have transferred the related advance facilities to New Residential, we may have to obtain other sources of financing which may not be available. Our inability to fund these advances could result in a termination event under the applicable servicing agreement, an event of default under the advance facilities and a breach of our purchase agreement with New Residential. Our inability to fund these advance requests could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use financial models and estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets, such as MSRs. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be required to record impairment charges.\nWe use internal financial models that utilize, wherever possible, market participant data to value certain of our assets, including our MSRs, newly originated loans held for sale and investments in debt securities for purposes of financial reporting. These models are complex and use asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates. In addition, the modeling requirements of MSRs are complex because of the high number of variables that drive cash flows associated with MSRs. Even if the general accuracy of our valuation models is validated, valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models. In determining value for MSRs we make certain assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe rates of prepayment and repayment within the underlying pools of mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nprojected rates of delinquencies, defaults and liquidations;\n\u2022\nfuture interest rates;\n\u2022\nour cost to service the loans;\n\u2022\nancillary revenues; and\n\u2022\namounts of future servicing advances.\nIf these assumptions or relationships prove to be inaccurate, if market conditions change or if errors are found in our models, the value of certain of our assets may decrease. We may be required to record impairment charges, which could impact our ability to\nsatisfy minimum net worth covenants and borrowing conditions in our debt agreements and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates.\nFrom time to time, we have used various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. The derivative financial instruments that we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risks. In addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet the financing requirements of our business.\nOur financing strategy includes the use of significant leverage because in order to make servicing advances and fund originations, we require liquidity in excess of that generated by our operations. Accordingly, our ability to finance our operations and repay maturing obligations rests in large part on our ability to borrow money. We are generally required to renew our financing arrangements each year, which exposes us to refinancing and interest rate risks. Our ability to refinance existing debt and borrow additional funds is affected by a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nlimitations imposed on us under the indentures governing our unsecured senior notes and other financing agreements that contain restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions that may limit our ability to raise additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe available liquidity in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the lenders from which we borrow; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on borrowings on advance facilities imposed by the amount of eligible collateral pledged, which may be less than the borrowing capacity of the advance facility.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we periodically borrow money or sell newly-originated loans to fund our servicing and originations operations. Our ability to fund current operations and meet our servicing advance obligations depends on our ability to secure these types of financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace existing financings as they expire.\nWe rely on our servicing and originations advance facilities for substantially all of the liquidity we require to fund the mortgage loans that we originate and the servicing advances we are required to make. We may elect to fund these liquidity needs from cash flows available to us. To the extent we do not have sufficient cash available to meet these liquidity needs we will continue to draw on originations and servicing advance facilities. Such financings may not be available with the GSEs or other counterparties on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain such financings, we may need to raise the funds we require in the capital markets or through other means, any of which may increase our cost of funds.\nAn event of default, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and make it difficult for us to renew existing credit facilities or obtain new lines of credit. We intend to continue to seek opportunities to acquire loan servicing portfolios and/or businesses that engage in loan servicing and/or loan originations. Our liquidity and capital resources may be diminished by any such transactions. Additionally, we believe that a significant acquisition may require us to raise additional capital to facilitate such a transaction, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur GSE agreements contain financial covenants that include capital requirements related to tangible net worth. To the extent that these capital requirements are not met, the GSEs may suspend or terminate these agreements, which would prohibit us from further servicing these specific types of mortgage loans or being an approved servicer. If we are unable to meet these capital requirements, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. bank regulatory agencies finalized rules implementing international accords on strengthening capital requirements, known as Basel III, which could increase the cost of funding on financial institutions that we rely on for financing and therefore reduce our sources of funding and increase the costs of originating and servicing mortgage loans. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms for any of the foregoing reasons, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.2 billion of total unsecured senior notes and unfunded availability of approximately $3.0 billion under our various financing facilities. Our substantial indebtedness and any future indebtedness we incur could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy and comply with our obligations with respect to the unsecured senior notes;\n\u2022\nsubject us to increased sensitivity to increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with relatively less debt in economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events; or\n\u2022\nreduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business, industry and economic conditions.\nIn addition, our substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, general corporate and other purposes, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors outside of our control. Our substantial obligations could have other important consequences. For example, our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which limit our ability to incur liens, to incur debt and to sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could harm our business or prospects and could result in our bankruptcy.\nWe may incur more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries are able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although these agreements generally restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt, the related risks could be magnified and could limit our financial and operating activities.\nOur counterparties may terminate our servicing rights and subservicing contracts.\nThe owners of the loans we service and the primary servicers of the loans we subservice, may, under certain circumstances, terminate our MSRs or subservicing contracts, respectively.\nAs is standard in the industry, under the terms of our master servicing agreements with GSEs, GSEs have the right to terminate us as servicer of the loans we service on their behalf at any time and also have the right to cause us to sell the MSRs to a third party. These agreements also require that we service in accordance with GSE servicing guidelines and contain financial covenants. See \u201cWe may be unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet the financing requirements of our business\u201d. Because we are required to follow the guidelines of the GSEs with which we do business and are not able to negotiate our fees with these entities for the purchase of our loans, our competitors may be able to sell their loans on more favorable terms. Some GSEs may also have the right to require us to assign the MSRs to a subsidiary and sell our equity interest in the subsidiary to a third party. Under our subservicing contracts, the primary servicers for which we conduct subservicing activities have the right to terminate our subservicing rights with or without cause, with little notice and little to no compensation. We expect to continue to acquire subservicing rights, which could exacerbate these risks.\nIf we were to have our servicing or subservicing rights terminated on a material portion of our servicing portfolio, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of previous or potential future acquisitions.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of previous or potential future acquisitions of servicing portfolios and other businesses and assets will depend, in part, on our ability to scale-up to appropriately service any such assets, and integrate the businesses of such acquired companies with our business. The process of acquiring assets or companies may disrupt our business and may not result in the full benefits expected. The risks associated with acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nunknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, servicing practices, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nnot retaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns.\nIn the event that we acquire a platform, we may elect to operate this platform in addition to our current platform for a period of time or indefinitely. Individually or collectively, these transactions could substantially increase the UPB, or alter the composition of our portfolio, of mortgage loans that we service or have an otherwise significant impact on our business. We can provide no assurances that we will enter into any such agreements or as to the timing of any potential acquisitions. Additionally, we may make or have made potentially significant acquisitions which could expose us to greater risks than we currently experience in servicing our current portfolio and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of potential future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, the success of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively integrate the acquired assets or businesses. The acquired assets or businesses may not contribute to our revenues or earnings to any material extent, and cost savings and synergies we expect at the time of an acquisition may not be realized once the acquisition has been completed. If we inappropriately value the assets we acquire or the value of the assets we acquire declines after we acquire them, the resulting charges may negatively affect the carrying value of the assets on our balance sheet and our earnings. Furthermore, if we incur additional indebtedness to finance an acquisition, the acquired business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service that additional indebtedness. Unsuitable or unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to indemnify or repurchase loans we sold, or will sell, if these loans fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances.\nThe indentures governing our securitized pools of loans and our contracts with purchasers of our whole loans contain provisions that require us to indemnify or repurchase the related loans under certain circumstances. While our contracts vary, they contain provisions that require us to repurchase loans if:\n\u2022\nour representations and warranties concerning loan quality and loan circumstances are inaccurate, including representations concerning the licensing of a mortgage broker;\n\u2022\nwe fail to secure adequate mortgage insurance within a certain period after closing;\n\u2022\na mortgage insurance provider denies coverage;\n\u2022\nwe fail to comply, at the individual loan level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements in the current dynamic regulatory environment; or\n\u2022\nthe borrower fails to make certain initial loan payments due to the purchaser.\nWe believe that, as a result of the current market environment, many purchasers of residential mortgage loans are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify or repurchase loans and would benefit from enforcing any repurchase remedies they may have. Along with others in the industry, we are subject to repurchase claims and may continue to receive claims in the future. If we are required to indemnify or repurchase loans that we originate or have previously originated and sell or securitize that result in losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to government mortgage modification programs could adversely affect future incremental revenues.\nUnder the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), the Making Home Affordable plan (MHA), or and similar government programs, a participating servicer may be entitled to receive financial incentives in connection with any modification plans it enters into with eligible borrowers and subsequent success fees to the extent that a borrower remains current in any agreed upon loan modification.\nWe participate in and dedicate numerous resources to HARP and HAMP. In 2014, 40% of our total originations were HARP loans. Changes in legislation or regulation regarding HARP, HAMP or any other government mortgage modification program or changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans may impact the extent to which we participate in and receive financial benefits from such programs, or may increase our operating costs and the expense of our participation in such programs. HARP is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2015 and HAMP is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. If HARP or HAMP is not extended, this could decrease our revenues, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder MHA, a participating servicer may receive a financial incentive to modify qualifying loans, in accordance with the plan\u2019s guidelines and requirements. HARP also allows us to refinance loans with an LTV of up to 125%. This program and the FHA\u2019s negative equity refinance program allow us to refinance loans to existing borrowers who have little or negative equity in their homes. The FHA\u2019s negative equity refinance program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016, and the expiration of that program or changes in legislation or regulations regarding that program or the MHA could reduce our volume of refinancing\noriginations to borrowers with little or negative equity in their homes. Changes to HAMP, HARP, the MHA and other similar programs could adversely affect our future incremental revenues.\nOur earnings may decrease because of changes in prevailing interest rates.\nOur profitability is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. The following are certain material risks we face related to changes in prevailing interest rates:\n\u2022\nan increase in prevailing interest rates could generate an increase in delinquency, default and foreclosure rates resulting in an increase in both operating expenses and interest expense and could cause a reduction in the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nan increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our loan originations volume because refinancing an existing loan would be less attractive for homeowners and qualifying for a purchase money loan may be more difficult for consumers;\n\u2022\nan increase in prevailing interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our outstanding debt, including our ability to finance servicing advances and loan originations;\n\u2022\na decrease in prevailing interest rates may increase prepayment speeds causing our servicing fees to decline more rapidly than anticipated and we may record a decrease in the value of our MSRs;\n\u2022\na decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to higher compensating interest expense and increased amortization expense as we revise downward our estimate of total expected income as prepayment speeds increase; and\n\u2022\na decrease in prevailing interest rates could reduce our earnings from our custodial deposit accounts.\nBorrowers with adjustable rate mortgage loans or loan modifications that will be adjusting in 2015 are especially exposed to increases in monthly payments and they may not be able to refinance their loans.\nBorrowers with adjustable rate mortgage loans are exposed to increased monthly payments when the related mortgage loan\u2019s interest rate adjusts upward from an initial fixed rate or a low introductory rate, as applicable, to the rate computed in accordance with the applicable index and margin. Borrowers with adjustable rate mortgage loans seeking to refinance their mortgage loans to avoid increased monthly payments as a result of an upward adjustment of the mortgage loan\u2019s interest rate may no longer be able to find available replacement loans at comparably low interest rates. This increase in borrowers\u2019 monthly payments, together with any increase in prevailing market interest rates, may result in significantly increased monthly payments for borrowers with adjustable rate mortgage loans, which may cause delinquency, default and foreclosure. Increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures may adversely affect our business as they reduce the number of mortgages we service. As of December 31, 2014, we serviced or held adjustable rate mortgage loans with a total UPB of approximately $100 billion on our outstanding forward residential mortgage loans and the average interest rate of our portfolio of adjustable rate mortgage loans was 21.0%. Because of the continuing low interest rate environment, a significant portion of our adjustable rate mortgage loans subject to adjustment during 2014 did not experience a rate increase. Likewise, loan modifications entered into in 2009 may have provisions providing for an increase in the interest rate by 1% in 2015 and 1% per year thereafter until an interest rate cap is reached. Some borrowers on loan modifications may re-default again due to the increased monthly payment of principal and interest, which could lead to higher servicing costs for these defaulted loans.\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors.\nThere are various proposals which deal with GSE reform, including winding down the GSEs and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as proposals to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of loans that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. Thus, the long-term future of the GSEs is still in doubt.\nOur ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the GSEs, Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of MBS in the secondary market. These entities play a critical role in the residential mortgage industry and we have significant business relationships with many of them. Almost all of the conforming loans we originate qualify under existing standards for inclusion in guaranteed mortgage securities backed by one of these entities. We also derive other material financial benefits from these relationships, including the assumption of credit risk on loans included in such mortgage securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees and the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. If it is not possible for us to complete the sale or securitization of certain of our mortgage loans due to changes in GSE programs, we may lack liquidity under our mortgage financing facilities to continue to fund mortgage loans and our revenues and margins on new loan originations would be materially and negatively impacted.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these GSEs or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of these GSEs could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not effectively develop, market, sell and implement multiple new technologies we intend to deploy.\nSolutionstar, our technology and services segment, provides enhanced technology and data solutions to homebuyers, home sellers, real estate agents and companies that engage in the origination and servicing of loans. We intend to develop, market and sell multiple new technologies, which will require smarter and more effective investments in innovative technologies and services to make the home purchase experience simpler, more integrated, accessible and transparent. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance monitoring. We may not be effective in developing technology that operates across multiple technologies and platforms, that is appealing to consumers, that adequately meets the demands of the marketplace and that achieves market acceptance. Any of these results would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks against us or our vendors could damage our business operations and increase our costs.\nThe financial services industry as a whole is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, and system disruptions and failures caused by fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion (cyber-attack), computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters and other similar events may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our borrowers. Security breaches, acts of vandalism and developments in computer intrusion capabilities could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we or our vendors use to protect our borrowers\u2019 personal information and transaction data. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as persons involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our reliance on the Internet and use of web-based product offerings and on the use of cybersecurity.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our or our vendors\u2019 systems or a defect in the integrity of our or our vendors\u2019 systems or cybersecurity could cause serious negative consequences for our business, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or operating systems and to those of our customers and counterparties. Any of the foregoing events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could have a downgrade in our servicer ratings.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch rate us as a residential loan servicer. Favorable ratings from these agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing business. Downgrades in servicer ratings could adversely affect our ability to finance servicing advances and maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Downgrades in our servicer ratings could also lead to the early termination of existing advance facilities and affect the terms and availability of advance facilities that we may seek in the future. In addition, some of our servicing agreements require that we maintain specified servicer ratings. Our failure to maintain favorable or specified ratings may cause our termination as servicer and further impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could have, appear to have or be alleged to have conflicts of interest with Solutionstar.\nOur subsidiary, Solutionstar, provides services to us. This relationship could create, appear to create or be alleged to create conflicts of interest. By obtaining services from a subsidiary, there is risk of possible claims of collusion or claims that such services are not provided by Solutionstar upon market terms. We have adopted policies, procedures and practices, and have also engaged an independent third party to conduct a market-pricing study, to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Solutionstar. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in eliminating all conflicts of interest or that third parties will refrain from making such allegations.\nWe have operations in India that could be adversely affected by changes in the political or economic stability of India or by government policies in India or the United States.\nWe currently have operations located in India and expect to grow those operations. A significant change in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. The political or regulatory climate in the United States. or elsewhere, also could change so that it would not be lawful or practical for us to use international operations in the manner in which we currently use them. For example, changes in regulatory\nrequirements could require us to curtail our use of lower-cost operations in India to service our businesses. If we had to curtail or cease our operations in India and transfer some or all of these operations to another geographic area, we would incur significant transition costs as well as higher future overhead costs that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). Any violations of the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks.\nWe have significant vendors that, among other things, provide us with financial, technology and other services to support our businesses. With respect to vendors engaged to perform activities required by the applicable servicing criteria, we assess compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the applicable vendor (for Reg AB purposes, some vendors provide their own assessments and attestations) and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor\u2019s activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the servicing criteria, it could negatively impact our servicing agreements. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have reduced our costs by contracting with certain third parties with operations in India and the Philippines. As of December 31, 2014, we have 2,250 offshore resources in seven sites in India and the Philippines and may expand to other countries in the future. These countries are subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions can decrease efficiency and increase our costs in these countries. Weakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these foreign countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy. Any political or economic instability in these countries could result in our having to replace or reduce these vendor relationships which may increase our labor costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, regulatory, legal and reputational risk. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending and debt collection practices, technology failures, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can also result from media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, trading counterparties and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our customers and communities, this risk will always be present in our organization.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe operate within a highly regulated industry on a federal, state and local level and our business results are significantly impacted by the laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nAs a national mortgage services firm, we are subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal, state and local laws in the United States. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that we do business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make our costs to service or originate loans higher, which could impact our financial results.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued proposed changes to its Mortgage Servicing Rules, in November 2014. The proposed changes, if adopted as proposed, may increase the costs of loss mitigation and increase foreclosure timelines. Other\nnew regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in our business, result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such business. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, we could be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. The proposed amendments to CFPB Mortgage Servicing Rules will increase the complexity of the loss mitigation and foreclosure processes and our inadvertent failure to comply with these rules could lead to losses in the value of the loans, be an event of default under various servicing agreements or subject us to fines and penalties. The cumulative effect of these changes could result in a material impact on our earnings.\nWe could be subject to additional regulatory requirements or changes under the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd Frank Act) beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated, particularly given the ongoing heightened regulatory environment in which financial institutions operate. There also continues to be discussion of potential GSE reform which would likely affect markets for mortgages and mortgage securities in ways that cannot be predicted. In addition FHFA initiatives may be implemented by the GSEs that could materially effect the market for conventional and/or government insured loans. The heightened regulatory environment has resulted not only in a tendency toward more regulation, but toward the most prescriptive regulation as regulatory agencies have generally taken a conservative approach to rule making, interpretive guidance and their general ongoing supervisory authority.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd Frank Act, including the implementation of the originations and servicing rules by the CFPB and the CFPB\u2019s continuing examinations of our business, could increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs and place restrictions on our operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, certain regulators have recently taken steps to block the acquisition of MSRs by one of our competitors. It is possible that we could become subject to similar actions with respect to our acquisition of MSRs or other key business operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous legal proceedings, federal, state or local governmental examinations, investigations or enforcement actions and related costs could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Some of these matters are highly complex and slow to develop, and results are difficult to predict or estimate.\nWe are routinely and currently involved in a significant number of legal proceedings concerning matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There is no assurance that the number of legal proceedings will not increase in the future, and it is possible that one or more class actions may be certified against us. These legal proceedings range from actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially tens of thousands of class members. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, employment, contract, tort, common law fraud and numerous other laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Servicemember's Civil Relief Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Truth in Lending Act, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and False Claims Act and Making Home Affordable (MHA) loan modification programs.\nAdditionally, along with others in our industry, we are subject to repurchase or indemnification claims and may continue to receive claims in the future, including from our Legacy Portfolio regarding alleged breaches of representation and warranties relating to the sale of mortgage loans or the placement of mortgage loans into securitization trusts or the servicing of loans included in securitization trusts. We are also subject to legal actions or proceedings related to loss sharing and indemnification provisions of our various acquisitions.\nOur business is also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement, including both formal and informal inquiries, from various state and federal agencies as part of those agencies' oversight of the mortgage services and ancillary businesses. Such inquiries may include those into servicer foreclosure fees, processes and procedures, loan modification processes including loans being transferred and lender placed insurance, and may result in us becoming subject to subpoenas or otherwise required to provide information to state or federal regulators. An adverse result in governmental investigations or examinations or private lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits, may adversely affect our financial results or result in serious reputational harm. In addition, a number of participants in our industry have been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and regulatory actions by state regulators, and other industry participants have been the subject of actions by state Attorneys General. Although we believe we have meritorious legal and factual defenses to the lawsuits in which we are currently involved, the ultimate outcomes with respect to these matters remain uncertain. The outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings, which may last several years. Although we\nestablish accruals for our legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued.\nLitigation and other proceedings may require that we pay settlement costs, legal fees, damages, including punitive damages, penalties or other charges, or be subject to injunctive relief affecting our business practices, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, ongoing and other legal proceedings brought under state consumer protection statutes may result in a separate fine for each violation of the statute, which, particularly in the case of class action lawsuits, could result in damages substantially in excess of the amounts we earned from the underlying activities and that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. The costs of responding to the investigations can be substantial.\nMoreover, regulatory changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory changes such as the creation of the CFPB with its own examination and enforcement authority and the \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could further increase the number of legal and regulatory proceedings against us. In addition, while we take numerous steps to prevent and detect employee misconduct, such as fraud, employee misconduct cannot always be deterred or prevented and could subject us to additional liability.\nA consent order entered into by one of the largest non-bank servicers with a state regulatory agency could impose additional compliance costs on our servicing business.\nOn December 22, 2014, the New York Department of Financial Services entered into a consent order against the largest non-bank mortgage servicer in the United States regarding servicing misconduct and conflict of interest issues. The consent order requires the servicer, among other things to: (i) provide upon the request of a New York borrower the complete loan file at no cost to the borrower; (ii) provide every New York borrower who is denied a modification, short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure a detailed explanation of the reasons for the denial; and (iii) provide at no cost to New York borrowers a copy of their complete credit report and credit score. In addition the board of directors of the servicer will be required to provide additional oversight in a number of areas; and the servicer will have an independent operations monitor for three years.\nAlthough we are not a party to the above consent order noted above, we could become subject to some of the terms of the consent judgment if (i) the agencies begin to enforce the requirements of the consent order by amending their servicing guides; (ii) the mortgage servicers or investors for which we service or subservice loans request that we comply with certain aspects of the consent judgment, (iii) if we purchase MSRs from this servicer or (iv) we otherwise find it prudent to comply with certain aspects of the consent order. In addition, some of the requirements set forth in such consent order may be adopted by the industry as a whole, forcing us to comply with them in order to follow standard industry practices. While we may make changes to our operating policies and procedures in light of this consent order and other developments, these changes to our servicing practices could increase compliance and operational costs for our servicing business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations in the mortgage industry.\nFederal, state and local governments have recently proposed or enacted numerous laws, regulations and rules related to mortgage loans generally and loan modifications as wells foreclosure actions. These laws, regulations and rules may result in delays in the foreclosure process, reduced payments by borrowers, modification of the original terms of mortgage loans, permanent forgiveness of debt and increased servicing advances.\nDue to the highly regulated nature of the residential mortgage industry, we are required to comply with a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our servicing, originations and ancillary business and the fees we may charge. These regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, monitoring and internal and external audits. A material failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could subject us to lawsuits or governmental actions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there continue to be changes in legislation and licensing in an effort to simplify the consumer mortgage experience, which require technology changes and additional implementation costs for loan originators. We expect legislative changes will continue in the foreseeable future, which may increase our operating expenses.\nSolutionstar is subject to numerous licensing and regulatory requirements as a provider of ancillary services to companies in the financial services industry. These services include managing loans in the foreclosure/real estate owned (REO) process as well as providing auctioneer services, title agency and closing services, valuation and appraisal services, and debt resolution services nationwide. Solutionstar is subject to audits and examinations that are conducted by federal and state regulatory authorities and, as a vendor, is also subject to similar audit requirements imposed upon its clients, including us. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by various state licensing authorities for the particular type of service provided and to participate in regular background checks, fingerprinting requirements and continuing education programs. We may incur significant ongoing\ncosts to comply with governmental regulations and new laws and regulations may be adopted that prohibit us from engaging our affiliate, Solutionstar, as a vendor, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen borrowers fail to provide hazard or flood insurance on their residences, the servicer of the loan is contractually obligated to place such insurance to protect the collateral and passes the premium costs onto the borrower. In the past, some of our subsidiaries earned commissions as licensed insurance agencies from the sale of lender-placed insurance on our portfolios. However, this practice has changed. As of June 1, 2014, the Company and/or its subsidiaries no longer earns commissions on lender-placed insurance on a borrower's residence. This change comports with the servicing guide announcement by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that excludes from reimbursement any lender-placed insurance commissions and revenue earned by entities related to the servicer, such as our subsidiaries. Similarly, the change also comports with proposed or issued regulations by Florida and New York regulators that prohibit collateral protection insurer from paying commissions to a mortgage servicer or its affiliate.\nFurthermore, there continue to be changes in state laws that are adverse to mortgage servicers that increase costs and operational complexity of our business and impose significant penalties for violation.\nAny of these changes in law could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnlike competitors that are national banks, we are subject to state licensing and operational requirements that result in substantial compliance costs.\nBecause we are not a depository institution, we do not benefit from a federal exemption to state mortgage banking, loan servicing or debt collection licensing and regulatory requirements. We must comply with state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and we are sensitive to regulatory changes that may increase our costs through stricter licensing laws, disclosure laws or increased fees or that may impose conditions to licensing that we or our personnel are unable to meet. In addition, we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulators, which can result in refunds to borrowers of certain fees earned by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by state regulators due to compliance errors. Future state legislation and changes in existing regulation may significantly increase our compliance costs or reduce the amount of ancillary revenues, including late fees, that we may charge to borrowers. This could make our business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could materially affect our business.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we lose our licenses.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. In most states in which we operate, a regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to mortgage servicing companies and mortgage originations companies such as us as well as regulating our ancillary service providers. These rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a mortgage servicing company, mortgage originations company or third-party debt default specialist, title insurance agency, appraisal management company, licensed auctioneer, and other similar types of requirements as to the form and content of contracts and other documentation, licensing of our employees and employee hiring background checks, licensing of independent contractors with which we contract, restrictions on certain practices, disclosure and record-keeping requirements and enforcement of borrowers\u2019 rights. We are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities.\nWe believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. We may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing or other agreements and have a material adverse effect on our operations. The states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our businesses may later choose to do so, and if such states so act, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all requisite licenses and permits. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing agreements and have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, the adoption of additional, or the revision of existing, rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur increased litigation costs and related losses if a borrower, or class of borrowers, challenges the validity of a foreclosure action or if a court overturns a foreclosure.\nWe may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or a class of borrowers. If a court overturns a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to a title insurer or the purchaser of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. A significant increase in litigation costs could adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for an advance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResidential mortgage foreclosure proceedings in certain states have been delayed due to lack of judicial resources and new legislation, all of which could have a negative effect on our ability to liquidate loans timely and slow the recovery of advances and thus impact our earnings or liquidity.\nIn some states, such as Florida, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, our industry has faced, and may continue to face, increased delays and costs in the foreclosure process related to the re-execution and re-filing of certain documents. In addition, California and Nevada have enacted Homeowner\u2019s Bill of Rights legislation to establish fair lending and borrowing practices for homeowners which may cause delays in foreclosure proceedings. Delays in foreclosure proceedings could also require us to make additional servicing advances by drawing on our servicing advance facilities, or delay the recovery of advances, all or any of which could materially affect our earnings and liquidity and increase our need for capital.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may experience substantial volatility which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. For example, the closing market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange fluctuated between $24.50 per share and $57.95 per share from 2013 through 2014 and may continue to fluctuate. The volatility may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price. Market price fluctuations in our common stock may be due to reduced liquidity resulting from highly concentrated ownership of our common stock, acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements along with a variety of additional factors.\nIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nFIF HE Holdings LLC (FIF), which is primarily owned by certain private equity funds managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (Fortress), owns approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock as of February 27, 2015. As a result, FIF owns shares sufficient for the majority vote over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by other stockholders. The interests of FIF may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, FIF may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to other stockholders or adversely affect us or other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our stockholders agreement with FIF (Stockholders Agreement), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThese provisions provide for:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause and only with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote (provided, however, that for so long as FIF and certain other affiliates of Fortress and permitted transferees (collectively, the Fortress Stockholders) beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common stock, directors may be removed with or without cause with the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote);\n\u2022\nprovisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders (provided, however, that for so long as the Fortress Stockholders beneficially own at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock, any stockholders that collectively beneficially own at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock may call special meetings of our stockholders);\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain rights to the Fortress Stockholders with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors, including the ability to appoint a majority of the members of our board of directors for so long as the Fortress Stockholders continue to beneficially own at least 40% of our issued and outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nno provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;\n\u2022\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws only permit action by our stockholders outside a meeting by unanimous written consent, provided, however, that for so long as the Fortress Stockholders beneficially own at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock, our stockholders may act without a meeting by written consent of a majority of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nunder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders. Nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, these provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by FIF, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nCertain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.\nFortress has other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, FIF has the right, and has no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If FIF or any of its officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.\nIn the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of FIF acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person's capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then to the fullest extent permitted by law such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person's fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us, if FIF pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if FIF does not present the corporate opportunity to us.\nAdditionally, we may continue to enter into transactions with Fortress and its affiliates such as selling a percentage of the excess cash flow generated from our MSRs or selling the rights to mortgage servicing rights, mortgage servicing rights and servicer advances related to loan pools. These transactions may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. Such transactions may present an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest.\nAdditionally, we may continue to enter into transactions with Fortress and its affiliates such as selling a percentage of the excess cash flow generated from our MSRs or selling the rights to mortgage servicing rights, mortgage servicing rights and servicer advances related to loan pools.
