{"cik": "906709", "company": "NEKTAR THERAPEUTICS", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements. We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Investors in Nektar Therapeutics should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Research and Development Efforts\nWe are highly dependent on the success of bempegaldesleukin, our lead I-O candidate. We are executing a clinical development program for bempegaldesleukin and clinical and regulatory outcomes for bempegaldesleukin, if not successful, will significantly harm our business.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize bempegaldesleukin. In general, most investigational drugs, including I-O drug candidates such as bempegaldesleukin, do not become approved drugs. Accordingly, there is a very meaningful risk that bempegaldesleukin will not succeed in one or more clinical trials sufficient to support one or more regulatory approvals. To date, reported clinical outcomes from bempegaldesleukin have had a significant impact on our market valuation, and business prospects and we expect this to continue in future periods. If one or more clinical studies of bempegaldesleukin are delayed (as a result of, for example, our collaboration partner causing a delay of the initiation or completion of one or more clinical trials for reasons outside of our control) or not successful, it would materially harm our market valuation, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. For example, under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we are entitled to up to approximately $1.455 billion in development milestone payments (of which we have received $50.0 million) that are based upon clinical and regulatory successes from the bempegaldesleukin development program. One or more failures in bempegaldesleukin studies could jeopardize such milestone payments, and any product sales or royalty revenue or commercial milestone payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.\nAdditionally, promising results from earlier trials may not predict similarly favorable outcomes in subsequent trials. For example, several of our past, planned and ongoing clinical trials utilize an \u201copen-label\u201d trial design. An \u201copen-label\u201d clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational drug candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational drug candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a \u201cpatient bias\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an \u201cinvestigator bias\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of our drug candidates for which we include an open-label clinical trial when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control.\nDelays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.\nWe or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates. We have ongoing trials evaluating bempegaldesleukin, including trials evaluating bempegaldesleukin as a potential combination treatment with BMS\u2019s Opdivo\u00ae as well as other ongoing and planned combination trials. Our partner Lilly is conducting two Phase 2 studies of NKTR-358 in patients with SLE and ulcerative colitis as well as two Phase 1b studies in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. We also continue to enroll patients in a Phase 1/2 study evaluating bempegaldesleukin in combination with NKTR-262 in patients with solid tumors. In addition, we have initiated a Phase 1 clinical study of NKTR-255 in adults with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma, as well as a Phase 1/2 clinical study of NKTR-255 in patients with relapsed or refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or colorectal cancer. These and other clinical studies may not begin on time,\nenroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials for any of our drug candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a clinical study;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement with applicable regulatory authorities on a clinical study design;\n\u2022for drug candidates (such as bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-358) partnered with other companies, delays caused by our partner;\n\u2022delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (see also the risk factor in this Item 1A titled \u201cOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic\u201d).\n\u2022imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other health authorities, which may occur at any time including after any inspection of clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022suspension or termination of a clinical study by us, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities due to adverse side effects of a drug on subjects in the trial;\n\u2022delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment rates;\n\u2022delays in manufacturing and delivery of sufficient supply of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022changes in regulatory authorities policies or guidance applicable to our drug candidates; and\n\u2022delays caused by changing standards of care or new treatment options.\nIf the initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies for our drug candidates is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, results for the studies would be delayed, and consequently the regulatory approval process would be delayed which would also delay our ability to commercialize these drug candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Clinical study delays could also shorten any commercial periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe outcomes from competitive I-O and combination therapy clinical trials, and the discovery and development of new potential oncology therapies, could have a material and adverse impact on the value of our I-O research and development pipeline.\nThe research and development of I-O therapies is a very competitive global segment in the biopharmaceutical industry attracting tens of billions of dollars of investment each year. Our clinical trial plans for bempegaldesleukin, NKTR-262, and NKTR-255 face substantial competition from other I-O combination regimens already approved, and many more combination therapies that are either ahead of or in parallel development in patient populations where we are studying our drug candidates. As I-O combination therapies are relatively new approaches in cancer treatment and few have successfully completed late stage development, I-O drug development entails substantial risks and uncertainties that include rapidly changing standards of care, identifying contribution of component therapies, patient enrollment competition, evolving regulatory frameworks to evaluate combination regimens, and varying risk-benefit profiles of competing therapies, any or all of which could have a material and adverse impact on the probability of success of I-O drug candidates.\nDrug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.\nWe have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials. Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive, difficult to design and implement and have highly uncertain outcomes that are difficult to predict. It will take us, or our collaborative partners, many years to conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our drug candidates. The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners\u2019 financial constraints.\nDrug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development. Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care (including commercialization of a competing therapy in the same or similar indication for which our drug candidate is being studied) and other variables (such as commercial supply challenges). The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to bempegaldesleukin, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, NKTR-255, and\nother drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development. The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.\nA number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving preclinical proof-of-concept or positive results from earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing regulatory authorities. Clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of our clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements. The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a drug candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the drug candidate. We, the FDA, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), an independent ethics committee (IEC), or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. Similarly, an IRB or IEC may suspend a clinical trial at a particular trial site. If one or more of our drug candidates fail in clinical studies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary drugs and drug candidates could make our technologies, drugs or drug candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and drug candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Competitors of our polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Biogen Inc., Horizon Pharma, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Ltd., SunBio Corporation, Laysan Bio, Inc., Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation. Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing polymer conjugation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.\nThere are many competitors for our proprietary drug candidates currently in development. For bempegaldesleukin, there are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors. Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Gilead Sciences, Inc. (through its acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc.)/NCI, Apeiron Biologics, Philogen S.p.A., Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics LLC, Anaveon AG, Adaptimmune LLC, and Novartis AG; potential competitors in the cytokine-based therapies space include Alkermes plc, ImmunityBio, Inc., Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc., Philogen S.p.A., Roche, Sanofi SA (through its acquisition of Synthorx, Inc.), and Eli Lilly & Co. (through its acquisition of Armo BioSciences); and potential competitors in the checkpoint inhibitor space include GlaxoSmithKline plc (through its acquisition of Tesaro, Inc.), Macrogenics, Inc., Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Roche. For NKTR-358, there are a number of competitors in various stages of clinical development that are working on programs which are designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body due to autoimmune disease. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies that could be cytokine-based therapies (Symbiotix, LLC, Janssen, AstraZeneca, and Tizona Therapeutics), regulatory T cell therapies (Targazyme, Inc., Caladrius BioSciences, Inc., and Tract Therapeutics, Inc.), or IL-2-based-therapies (Amgen Inc., Celgene Corporation, ILTOO Pharma, Pandion Therapeutics, and Roche). For NKTR-255, we believe companies that are currently researching and developing engineered IL-15 biologics and cell therapies that could compete with this drug candidate include Artiva Biotherapeutics, Fate Therapeutics, ImmunityBio, Inc., nkarta therapeutics, NKMax America, and Roche/Genentech (through its partnership with Xencor, Inc.). There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors. Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies. As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do. These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.\nPreliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data become available.\nFrom time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies. Preliminary data remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. Interim data are also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nRisks Related to our Collaboration Partners\nWe are highly dependent on our collaboration partners to initiate, properly conduct and prioritize clinical trials for bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-358 and to perform important additional development and commercialization activities, and our business will be significantly harmed if their actions deprioritize or otherwise harm the prospects of our drug candidates.\nWe rely on BMS (through the BMS Collaboration Agreement) and Lilly (through the Lilly Agreement) to initiate, properly conduct, and prioritize clinical trials and other development-related activities for bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-358, respectively. Furthermore, we will rely on BMS and Lilly to perform specified commercialization activities for bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-358, respectively, pursuant to the applicable agreement. In the event BMS or Lilly fails to initiate, properly conduct and prioritize their obligations under their applicable agreement with us, our business will be significantly harmed. Even if the applicable agreement provides us with enforcement or other curative rights to address the harm caused by BMS\u2019s or Lilly\u2019s action (or failure to act), our efforts in pursuing a remedy would be costly and there is no guarantee that efforts would succeed or be sufficient to fully address the harm.\nIn addition, for reasons outside of our control, the operations of our collaboration partners may be more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than we are, or they may adopt more restrictive procedures for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, either of which would delay initiating or completing one or more clinical trials involving our drug candidates.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirement\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on the ability of our collaboration partners to successfully develop and market drugs and they may fail to do so.\nUnder our collaboration agreements with various pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies (other than Nektar-run trials under the BMS Collaboration Agreement), our collaboration partner is generally solely responsible for:\n\u2022designing and conducting large scale clinical studies;\n\u2022preparing and filing documents necessary to obtain government approvals to sell a given drug candidate; and/or\n\u2022marketing and selling the drugs when and if they are approved.\nOur reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of significant risks to our business, including risks that:\n\u2022we have very little control over the timing and level of resources that our collaboration partners dedicate to commercial marketing efforts such as the amount of investment in sales and marketing personnel, general marketing campaigns, direct-to-consumer advertising, product sampling, pricing agreements and rebate strategies with government and private payers, manufacturing and supply of drug product, and other marketing and selling activities that need to be undertaken and well executed for a drug to have the potential to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022collaboration partners with commercial rights may choose to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our partnered drugs than they devote to their own drugs or other drugs that they have in-licensed;\n\u2022we have very little control over the timing and amount of resources our partners devote to development programs in one or more major markets;\n\u2022disagreements with partners could lead to delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates or to litigation or arbitration proceedings;\n\u2022disputes may arise or escalate in the future with respect to the ownership of rights to technology or intellectual property developed with partners;\n\u2022we do not have the ability to unilaterally terminate agreements (or partners may have extension or renewal rights) that we believe are not on commercially reasonable terms or consistent with our current business strategy;\n\u2022partners may be unable to pay us as expected;\n\u2022partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty; and\n\u2022partners may respond to natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by ceasing all or some of their development responsibilities (including the responsibility to clinical develop our drug candidates).\nGiven these risks, the success of our current and future collaboration partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative impact on our business. If the approved drugs fail to achieve commercial success or the drugs in development fail to have positive late stage clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory approval in major markets, it could significantly impair our access to capital necessary to fund our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug candidates. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital resources to advance our drug candidate pipeline, it would negatively impact the value of our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan. If we do not receive substantial milestone or royalty payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $1.2 billion. On April 13, 2020, we redeemed our senior notes at par and therefore repaid the principal of $250.0 million and accrued interest of $4.8 million. While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:\n\u2022the cost, timing and outcomes of clinical studies and regulatory reviews of our drug candidates - important examples include bempegaldesleukin and NKTR-358;\n\u2022if and when we receive potential milestone payments and royalties from our existing collaborations if the drug candidates subject to those collaborations achieve clinical, regulatory or commercial success;\n\u2022the progress, timing, cost and results of our clinical development programs;\n\u2022the success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to implement new collaborations, licenses and other transactions that increase our current net cash, such as the sale of additional royalty interests held by us, term loan or other debt arrangements, and the issuance of securities;\n\u2022the number of patients, enrollment criteria, primary and secondary endpoints, and the number of clinical studies required by the regulatory authorities in order to consider for approval our drug candidates and those of our collaboration partners;\n\u2022our general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and other uses of cash; and\n\u2022disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.\nA significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval. In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments and we choose to continue to advance our propreitary drug candidates to later stage research and development, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock. If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs. If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict. If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nIt is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of drug candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, drug scheduling status, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our drug candidates following approval by regulatory authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents. If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial potential of the drug candidate, the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate, or if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and this would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also depend on our relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and the commercialization of drug candidates. Poor performance by these companies, or disputes with these companies, could negatively impact our revenue and financial condition.\nIf government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered drug or proprietary drugs, those drugs will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of coverage and payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. However, eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a drug candidate will be adequately reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers costs related to research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our drug candidates even if there is adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.\nMoreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit coverage or pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers. Federal agencies, Congress and state legislatures have continued to show interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. In addition, in recent years, Congress has enacted various laws seeking to reduce the federal debt level and contain healthcare expenditures, and the Medicare and other healthcare programs are frequently identified as potential targets for spending cuts. New government legislation or regulations related to pricing or other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system as well as a government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage or reimbursement of, our products hold the potential to severely limit market opportunities of such products.\nRecent federal legislation and actions by federal, state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may face competition in the United States for our development candidates and investigational medicines, if approved, from therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, contains provisions that call for the promulgation of regulations that expand pharmacists\u2019 and wholesalers\u2019 ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. Further, the MMA provides that these changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect, unless and until the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public\u2019s health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. On September 23, 2020, the U.S. Secretary of the HHS made such certification to Congress, and on October 1, 2020, FDA published a final rule that allows for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Under the final rule, States and Indian Tribes, and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers, may submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. Since the issuance of the final rule, several industry groups have filed federal lawsuits\nchallenging multiple aspects of the final rule, and authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. On September 25, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) stated drugs imported by States under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for \u201cbest price\u201d or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. Separately, the FDA also issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code, or NDC, for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nWe intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements. The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions. If we are unable to find suitable partners or negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.\nOur revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, from which we receive upfront fees, research and development reimbursement and funding, milestone and other contingent payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and product sales. Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch or the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors. Our past revenue generated from collaboration agreements is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue. If any of our existing or future collaboration partners fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture or ultimately commercialize any drug candidate under our collaboration agreement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a net loss of $444.4 million. If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone and other contingent payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary drug candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our drug candidates. We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.\nOther factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:\n\u2022develop drugs utilizing our technologies, either independently or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies;\n\u2022effectively estimate and manage clinical development costs, particularly the cost of the clinical studies for bempegaldesleukin, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, and NKTR-255;\n\u2022receive necessary regulatory and marketing approvals;\n\u2022maintain or expand manufacturing at necessary levels;\n\u2022achieve market acceptance of our partnered products;\n\u2022receive royalties on products that have been approved, marketed or submitted for marketing approval with regulatory authorities; and\n\u2022maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by health epidemics in regions where we have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, including both our own manufacturing operations as well as the manufacturing operations of third parties upon whom we rely. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, national, state and local governments in regions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have implemented, and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, border closures, increased border controls, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, business closures and other measures. These measures may disrupt normal business operations both in and outside areas affected by COVID-19, and may have significant negative impacts on our business.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and applicable government recommendations, and we have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have implemented work from home policies for most employees and limited business travel. Although we believe these and the other safety measures we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have not substantially impacted our productivity, it is not certain that this will continue to be the case.\nProlonged remote working arrangements could impact employees\u2019 productivity and morale, strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks. Operating requirements may continually change due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we may experience unpredictability in our expenses, employee productivity and employee work culture. Additionally, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks. If we, our partners, our suppliers, or our contractors experience a cyberattack, experience data accessibility issues, or encounter communication disruptions, our business may suffer as a result of the loss or theft of our important data, and we may be liable for compromising the protection of personal data.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could affect the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of the third parties with whom we seek important goods and services. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties fully due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and/or our operations may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, delays and disruptions experienced by our collaborators or other third parties due to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the ability of such parties to fulfill their obligations, which could affect clinical development or regulatory approvals of our drug candidates.\nOur clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigator recruitment, clinical site initiation, patient screening and patient enrollment may be delayed due to, for example, prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients who are successfully enrolled in clinical trials involving our drug candidates may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols due to, for example, shelter-in-place orders impeding movement, disrupted healthcare services, or health issues for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 status. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff, all of whom may have heightened risk for COVID-19, could adversely impact our clinical trial operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could affect our ability, and the ability third parties on whom we rely, to successfully manufacture sufficient supplies to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. For example, it may be more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the products required to conduct our clinical trials due to the demand for recently authorized vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation.\nAlthough we are implementing measures to maintain the integrity of our clinical trials, there is no guarantee that we will prevent all study protocol violations, missed study treatment visits, and other influences that jeopardize reliability and validity of our clinical trial data. If a regulatory authority determines our clinical trial data lacks integrity, there is no guarantee that we will have a remedy to correct or otherwise address the deficiency. Even if such a remedy is identified, the cost for implementing the remedy could be prohibitively expensive, time consuming, or both. As a consequence, a clinical study of our proprietary drug candidate in which the integrity of the clinical study is questioned or doubted may require lengthy and costly remediation measures (such as, for example, over-enrolling patients into the study or repeating the study), thereby causing substantial harm to our business.\nAlso, the COVID-19 pandemic could postpone necessary interactions with regulators regarding our drug candidates in development and could delay review or approval of our regulatory submissions.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic results in a substantial number of individual variables that could cause a significant negative impact on our operations and our business, thereby precluding useful predictions as to how this pandemic will ultimately affect us. Thus, any current assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of this disease on our clinical trial timelines, is subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material negative impact on our operations and our business.\nRisks Related to Supply and Manufacturing\nIf we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our contract manufacturering organizations (CMOs) are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient drug quantities meeting applicable quality standards required to support large clinical studies or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner, it could delay our or our collaboration partners\u2019 clinical studies or result in a breach of our contractual obligations, which could in turn reduce the potential commercial sales of our or our collaboration partners\u2019 products. As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages and any product sales or royalty revenue that we would otherwise be entitled to receive could be reduced, delayed or eliminated. In most cases, we rely on CROs to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners. The manufacturing of drugs involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process and analytical methods validations, and challenges in controlling for all of these variables. These risks and uncertainties are compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic wherein the facilities and employees responsible for manufacturing drugs for use in clinical trials may be negatively impacted such that there is an insufficient supply of study treatment drugs. We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party CMOs required for drug supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners. Failure by us or our CMOs to supply API or drug products in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners. Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed into law the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been public concern over the availability and accessibility of critical medical products, and the CARES Act enhances FDA\u2019s existing authority with respect to drug shortage measures. Under the CARES Act, we must have in place a risk management plan that identifies and evaluates the risks to the supply of approved drugs for certain serious diseases or conditions for each establishment where the drug or API is manufactured. The risk management plan will be subject to FDA review during an inspection. If we experience shortages in the supply of our marketed products, our results could be materially impacted.\nIf any CMO with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we may not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with a different CMO, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In either scenario, our clinical trials or commercial distribution could be delayed significantly as we establish alternative supply sources. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or drug candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original CMO and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change CMOs for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new CMO maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations. We will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product according to the specifications previously submitted to or approved by the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays associated with the verification of a new CMO could negatively affect our ability to develop drug candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner or within budget. Furthermore, a CMO may possess technology related to the manufacture of our drug candidate that such CMO owns independently. This would increase our reliance on such a CMO or\nrequire us to obtain a license from such CMO in order to have another CMO manufacture our products or drug candidates. In addition, in the case of the CMOs that supply our drug candidates, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, which could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials.\nBuilding and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming. In the past, we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development. There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.\nWe purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.\nWe often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunities or contract liabilities to third parties. For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations. Any interruption in supply, diminution in quality of raw materials supplied to us or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs.\nOur manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our CMOs are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and drug products, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions administering such requirements. We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our CMOs for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow and document our or our CMOs\u2019 adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures, administrative detention, or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. Regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP. Manufacturing delays, for us or our CMOs, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and over which we have little or no control. In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build, either internally or through third-party contracts, a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment, and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary drug candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary drug candidates. We rely heavily on these parties for the successful execution of our clinical trials. Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control. For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our drug candidates to us in an untimely manner. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or the failure of third parties to properly conduct our clinical trials could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Business Operations\nIf we are unable to create robust sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates successfully.\nWe are in the very early stages of building a commercialization and distribution capabilities for bempegaldesleukin in the United States and Europe. To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must develop robust internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and manage inventory, supply, labeling, storage, record keeping, and advertising and promotion capabilities, which is both expensive and time consuming, or enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, we have committed to co-commercializing bempegaldesleukin with BMS and establish global distribution and infrastructure for us to be able to book global revenue for bempegaldesleukin if it achieves regulatory approval. Establishing this commercialization capability requires a significant commitment of financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or through partnerships include:\n\u2022our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or successfully educate adequate numbers of physicians about the potential benefits associated with the use of, and to subsequently prescribe, our products;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products or multiple product pricing arrangements may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe ability to manage and operate our business as we execute our development and growth strategy will require effective planning and execution. Significant rapid growth could strain our management and internal resources, and other problems may arise that could adversely affect our financial performance. We expect that our efforts to grow will place a significant strain on personnel, management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Our ability to effectively manage future growth will also require us to successfully attract, train, motivate, retain and manage new employees and continue to update and improve our operational, financial and management controls and procedures. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.\nOur business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates. Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and establish a commercial organization in collaboration with our partners, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy. If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs\nthrough reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent. Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other dilutive financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.\nBecause competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.\nWe must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain commercial, marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel. We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel. Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have. Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees. Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nWe are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process. Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation and Regulatory Concerns\nWe may not elect or be able to take advantage of any expedited development or regulatory review and approval processes available to drug candidates granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA.\nWe intend to evaluate and continue ongoing discussions with the FDA on regulatory strategies that could enable us to take advantage of expedited development pathways for certain of our drug candidates, although we cannot be certain that our drug candidates will qualify for any expedited development pathways or that regulatory authorities will grant, or allow us to maintain, the relevant qualifying designations.\nBreakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drug candidates that are designed to treat serious or life-threatening diseases when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation of a drug candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the drug candidate and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support approval; more frequent written correspondence from FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers; intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1; organizational commitment involving senior managers; and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.\nAlthough bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo\u00ae received Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma, we may elect not to pursue Breakthrough Therapy designation for our other drug candidates, and the FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant these designations.\nAccordingly, even if we believe a particular drug candidate is eligible for Breakthrough Therapy, we cannot be assured that the FDA would decide to grant it. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for drug approval, and there is no assurance that such designation will result in expedited review or approval or that the approved indication will not be narrower than the indication covered by the Breakthrough Therapy designation. Thus, even though we have received Breakthrough Therapy designation, we may not experience a faster development process or review, and, upon any filing seeking regulatory approval, we may not obtain an approval from the FDA.\nIf we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nWe or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use. Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive review process for safety and efficacy by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities. The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict. For example, although the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation to bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo\u00ae for the treatment of patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma, there is no guarantee regulatory approval will follow, if at all, for this or any indication of bempegaldesleukin on a timely basis. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls. Further, regulatory authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners, which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate. In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities. For example, AstraZeneca is conducting a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK\u00ae to other treatments of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain and the results of this study could at some point in the future negatively impact the labeling, regulatory status, and commercial potential of MOVANTIK\u00ae.\nEven if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed. Our and our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of drug candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, substantially all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:\n\u2022clinical development and commercialization obligations that are based on certain commercial reasonableness performance standards that can often be difficult to enforce if disputes arise as to adequacy of our partner\u2019s performance;\n\u2022research and development performance and reimbursement obligations for our personnel and other resources allocated to partnered drug candidate development programs;\n\u2022clinical and commercial manufacturing agreements, some of which are priced on an actual cost basis for products supplied by us to our partners with complicated cost allocation formulas and methodologies;\n\u2022intellectual property ownership allocation between us and our partners for improvements and new inventions developed during the course of the collaboration;\n\u2022royalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables, including net sales calculations, geography, scope of patent claim coverage, patent life, generic competitors, bundled pricing and other factors; and\n\u2022indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.\nWe are a party to numerous significant collaboration agreements and other strategic transaction agreements (e.g., financings and asset divestitures) that contain complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations. If we are found to have materially breached such agreements, it could subject us to substantial liabilities and harm our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation matters involving the interpretation and application of complex terms and conditions of our agreements. One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock has, and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors and securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation.\nOur stock price is volatile. During the year ended December 31, 2020, based on closing prices on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $14.47 to $27.96 per share. In response to volatility in the price of our common stock in the past, Plaintiffs\u2019 securities litigation firms have sought information from us and/or shareholders as part of their investigation into potential securities violations and breaches of duties (among other corporate misconduct allegations). Following their investigations, Plaintiffs\u2019 securities litigation firms have often initiated legal action, including the filing of class action lawsuits, derivative lawsuits, and other forms of redress. We expect our stock price to remain volatile and we continue to expect the initiation of legal actions by Plaintiffs\u2019 securities litigation firms following share price fluctuations.\n\u2022A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including the risks described in this section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and the following:\n\u2022announcements of data from, or material developments in, our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners, including data regarding efficacy and safety, delays in clinical development, regulatory approval or commercial launch - in particular, data from clinical studies of bempegaldesleukin has had a significant impact on our stock price;\n\u2022the timing of outcomes from our clinical trials which can be difficult to predict particularly for clinical studies that have event-driven end points such as progression-free survival and overall survival;\n\u2022announcements by collaboration partners as to their plans or expectations related to drug candidates and approved drugs in which we have a substantial economic interest;\n\u2022announcements regarding terminations or disputes under our collaboration agreements;\n\u2022fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022developments in patent or other proprietary rights, including intellectual property litigation or entering into intellectual property license agreements and the costs associated with those arrangements;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products that may compete with our approved products or products under development;\n\u2022announcements of changes in governmental regulation affecting us or our competitors;\n\u2022litigation brought against us or third parties to whom we have indemnification obligations;\n\u2022public concern as to the safety of drug formulations developed by us or others;\n\u2022our financing needs and activities; and\n\u2022general market conditions.\nAt times, our stock price has been volatile even in the absence of significant news or developments. The stock prices of biotechnology companies and securities markets generally have been subject to dramatic price swings in recent years.\nWe may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.\nNumerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration. We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent rights will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners\u2019 technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties; however, the sufficiency of the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain in view of the long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology to avoid a need to secure a license. If we are required to enter\ninto a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished. If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and commercializing the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. We own more than 300 U.S. and 1,050 foreign patents and have a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies. There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law. Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly. Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition, inter partes review, re-examinations or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage). Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents. Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire prior to the commercialization of the drug. Moreover, even if a patent encompassing a drug has not expired prior to the drugs commercialization, the patent may only provide a short period of protection following the commercialization of products. In addition, our patents may be subject to post grant proceedings, such as or inter partes review and re-examinations, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or equivalent proceedings in other jurisdictions), which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.\nWe have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary drug candidates. There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply will actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships. Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.\nAn adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute. In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies or products.\nWe rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nThe manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks. If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage (or if we cannot secure product liability insurance), we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.\nIf we or current or future collaborators or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions and civil or criminal penalties.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, once we begin commercializing our drug candidates, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal and state governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the U.S. federal False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA;\n\u2022provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the \u201cHIPAA All-Payer Fraud Prohibition,\u201d that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website, effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician assistants and nurse practitioners;\n\u2022provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEnsuring that our future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imprisonment, monetary damages, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nDisruptions to the normal functioning of the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to perform and carry out important roles and activities on which the operation of our business relies, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other agencies on which our operations may rely is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities while local, national and international conditions warrant. On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials which the FDA continues to update. As of June 23, 2020, the FDA noted it was conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. On July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its goal of restarting domestic on-site inspections during the week of July 20, 2020, but such activities will depend on data about the virus\u2019 trajectory in a given state and locality and the rules and guidelines that are put in place by state and local governments. The FDA has developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. Should FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter. Further, if there is inadequate information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility, FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. In 2020, several companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA's inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA and other government employees and stop critical activities. Additionally, as of June 23, 2020, the FDA noted it is continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals. On July 16, 2020, FDA noted that it is continuing to expedite oncology product development with its staff teleworking full-time. However, FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future shutdowns of other government agencies, such as the SEC, may also impact our business through review of our public filings and our ability to access the public markets. In 2020, several companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA's inability to complete required inspections for their applications.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them. A third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information. Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties. In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims. If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad. Costs associated with litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings where we or other third parties are enforcing or seeking intellectual property rights, invalidating or limiting patent rights that have already been allowed or issued, or otherwise asserting proprietary rights through one or more potential legal remedies. For example, we are currently involved in German litigation proceedings whereby we and Bayer Healthcare LLC are seeking at least co-ownership rights in certain of each other\u2019s patent filings related to PEGylated Factor VIII products. We believe that Bayer\u2019s claims to an ownership interest in these is without merit and we are vigorously defending our exclusive ownership rights to this intellectual property. These German litigation proceedings are currently stayed pending the outcome of ongoing mediation efforts. In the U.S., Bayer filed a complaint against Baxalta and Nektar alleging the ADYNOVATE\u00ae product infringes a Bayer patent. Although the U.S. court dismissed all of Bayer\u2019s claims\nagainst Nektar and Nektar was removed as a defendant, a jury found the Bayer patent was valid and infringed, and awarded Bayer damages, the responsibility of which are borne fully by Baxalta. This damages award does not impact our royalties from sales of ADYNOVATE\u00ae under our collaboration with Baxalta and Baxalta is currently appealing the decision. In other U.S. proceedings, Nektar and Baxalta filed complaints against Bayer Healthcare alleging Bayer\u2019s JIVI\u00ae product infringes several Nektar patents. In addition, in response to notices AstraZeneca and we received from the generic companies, Apotex (Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp.), MSN Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., and Aurobindo Pharma USA INC. alerting us that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA to market a generic version of MOVANTIK\u00ae (Paragraph IV Certifications), AstraZeneca and we together filed patent infringement suits against each of these generic companies. In these Paragraph IV Certifications, all three generic companies only alleged one patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,012,469, is invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of their respective generic products. At this time, none of the other five Orange Book listed patents associated with MOVANTIK\u00ae are being challenged by these generics companies. In addition, on March 18, 2020, Aether Therapeutics Inc. filed a complaint against AstraZeneca, Nektar and Daiichi-Sanko, Inc. alleging MOVANTIK\u00ae infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 6,713,488, 8,748,448, 8,883,817 and 9,061,024. Also, on June 5, 2020, UCB Pharma S.A. and Celltech R&D Limited (collectively UCB) served notice of a Declaratory Judgment of Patent Invalidity proceeding filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a declaration of invalidity of specified U.S. patents owned by Nektar and licensed to UCB. UCB is also pursuing similar actions in other jurisdictions. We are also regularly involved in opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office and in inter partes review and re-examination proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office where third parties seek to invalidate or limit the scope of our allowed patent applications or issued patents covering (among other things) our drugs and platform technologies.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings other than those related to intellectual property. For example, on October 30, 2018, we and certain of our executives were named in a putative securities class action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (U.S. District Court in California), which complaint was subsequently amended on May 15, 2019. Also, on February 13, 2019, and February 18, 2019, shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware naming the CEO, CFO and certain members of our board of directors. These class action and shareholder derivative actions assert, among other things, that for a period beginning at least from November 11, 2017 through October 2, 2018, our stock was inflated due to alleged misrepresentations about the efficacy and safety of bempegaldesleukin. On December 30, 2020, the U.S. District Court in California granted Nektar\u2019s motion to dismiss all claims in this securities class action filing, and denied plaintiffs with the ability to file a further amended complaint. Following the motion to dismiss, on January 29, 2021, the class action plaintiffs filed a Notice to Appeal to appeal the district court\u2019s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nIn addition, on August 19, 2019, we and certain of our executives were named in a putative securities class action complaint filed in U.S. District Court in California, which complaint was subsequently amended on January 24, 2020. Also, on February 11, 2020, and on February 20, 2020, shareholder derivative complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in California naming the CEO, CFO and certain members of our board of directors, which derivative complaints were consolidated and subsequently amended on July 1, 2020. The class action and shareholder derivative complaints assert, among other things, that for a period between February 15, 2019 and August 8, 2019, inclusive, our stock was inflated due to an alleged failure to disclose a reduction in the planned number of bempegaldesleukin clinical trials and a bempegaldesleukin manufacturing issue. On January 26, 2021, the U.S. District Court in California granted Nektar\u2019s motion to dismiss all claims in this securities class action filing, stating (among other things) that \u201cDefendants\u2019 open disclosure of risks associated with trial delay \u2026 suggests that they acted openly with investors.\u201d Following the motion, the class action plaintiffs have an opportunity to file in early March a further amended complaint and the case remains pending.\nOn February 9, 2021, certain of our current and past directors and executives were named in a shareholder derivative complaint filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Allegations in this matter are similar to those raised in the putative securities class action complaints filed on October 30, 2018 and August 19, 2019 in the U.S. District Court in California.\nThe cost to us in initiating or defending any litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts or result in financial implications either in terms of seeking license arrangements or payment of damages or royalties. There is no guarantee that our insurance coverage for damages resulting from a litigation or the settlement thereof (including the putative securities class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits) is sufficient, thereby resulting in substantial financial risk to the Company.\nAll of the securities class action lawsuits and derivative complaints are in the early stages. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate a potential future loss or a range of potential future losses. However, an unfavorable resolution could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or prospects, and\npotentially result in paying monetary damages. We have recorded no liability for these matters in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020.\nOur operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, and we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials.\nAs a research-based biopharmaceutical company with significant research and development and manufacturing operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals, radioactive compounds, and other hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is substantial. If an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage.\nGeneral Risks to our Business\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:\n\u2022establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time;\n\u2022lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.\nFurther, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then-current market prices. We also have a change of control severance benefit plan, which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition. This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nWe significantly rely on information technology systems, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption, breach, or security lapse of that technology within our internal computer systems, or those of our partners, vendors, CROs, CMOs or other contractors or consultants, may result in a material disruption of our development programs and our operations.\nAs part of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property and personal data. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our partners, vendors, contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to loss, damage, denial-of-service, unauthorized access, or misappropriation. Such cybersecurity breaches may be the result of unauthorized activity by our employees and contractors, as well as by third parties who use cyberattack techniques involving malware, hacking and phishing, among others. Our information technology systems, and those of our partners, vendors, CROs, CMOs or other contractors or consultants are also vulnerable to natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any such compromise or disruption, no matter the origin, may cause an interruption of our operations. For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from any clinical trial involving our drug candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs. In addition, the loss, corruption or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal data or other proprietary or sensitive information could compromise the commercial viability of one or more of our programs, which would negatively affect our business. Also, the costs to us to investigate and mitigate cybersecurity incidents could be significant.\nIf we are found in violation of privacy and data protection laws, we may be required to pay penalties, be subjected to scrutiny by regulators or governmental entities, or be suspended from participation in government healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business to subject to many laws and regulations intended to protect the privacy and data of individuals participating in our clinical trials and our employees, among others. For example, with regard to individuals participating in our clinical trials, these laws and regulations govern the safeguarding the privacy, integrity, availability, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition to federal laws and regulations in the United States, such as the HIPAA requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, many state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information. These laws often differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nIn the United States, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA has increased our compliance costs and may increase our potential liability. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation. If passed, these proposals could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\nThe European Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the implementing legislation of EU Member States, apply to the collection and processing of personal data, including health-related information, by companies located in the EU, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside of the EU and processing personal information of individuals located in the EU. These laws impose strict obligations on the ability to process personal data, including health-related information, in particular in relation to their collection, use, disclosure and transfer. These include several requirements relating to, for example, (i) obtaining, in some situations, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, (ii) the information provided to the individuals about how their personal information is used, and (iii) ensuring the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), such as the United States, which are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection. Potential pecuniary fines for noncompliant companies may be up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenue.\nTo the extent that we are found liable for the inappropriate collection, storage, use or disclosure of protected information of individuals (such as employees and or clinical patients protected by any privacy or data protection law), we could be subject to reputational harm, monetary fines (such as those imposed by the GDPR and CCPA), civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to disclose the breach, and the development of our drug candidates could be delayed. In addition, we continue to be subject to new and evolving data protection laws and regulations from a variety of jurisdictions, and there is a risk that our systems and processes for managing and protecting data may be found to be inadequate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations that may adversely affect our operating results, including, taxation and tax policy changes, tax rate changes, new tax laws, or revised tax law interpretations, which individually or in combination may cause our effective tax rate to increase. In the U.S., the rules dealing with federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law and included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $2.0 billion, portions of which will begin to expire in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $1.3 billion, portions of which will begin to expire in 2026. These net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Federal net operating losses, or NOLs, generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 are not subject to expiration and generally may not be carried back to prior taxable years except that, under the CARES Act, NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 may be carried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year in which the loss arises. Additionally, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020, the deductibility of NOLs is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such taxable year (where taxable income is determined without regard to the net operating loss deduction itself).\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of our NOLs and tax credits that can be utilized annually to offset our future U.S. federal taxable income, if any. This limitation would generally apply in the event that the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Our existing NOLs and tax credits may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and tax credits could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Our NOLs and tax credits may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs and tax credits.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, access to patient markets, and regulatory certainty, which could adversely affect our operations.\nEffective January 31, 2020, the U.K. ceased to be a member state of the E.U., a process known as Brexit, and began a transition period, which expired on December 31, 2020.\nIn December 2020, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement, under which the EU and the U.K. will now form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU, including as it relates to trade, transport and visas. Under the trade and cooperation agreement, U.K. service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire EU single market, U.K. goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU. Depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement, we and others could face new regulatory costs and challenges.\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\nOur operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions, including, for example, adverse global economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See also the risk factor in this Item 1A titled \u201cOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients\u2019 ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our and our collaboration partners\u2019 drug products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nFurther, with rising international trade tensions, our business may be adversely affected following new or increased tariffs that result in the increased global clinical trial costs as a result of international transportation of clinical drug supplies, as well as the costs of materials and products imported into the U.S. Tariffs, trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the U.S. or other countries could increase the prices of our and our collaboration partners\u2019 drug products, affect our and our collaboration partners\u2019 ability to commercialize such drug products, or create adverse tax consequences in the U.S. or other countries. As a result, changes in international trade policy, changes in trade agreements and the imposition of tariffs or sanctions by the U.S. or other countries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.\nThere is an increased focus from certain investors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, which include environmental concerns and social investments. We could fail to meet, or be perceived to fail to meet, the expectations of these certain investors, employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, thereby resulting in a negative impact to our business.\nIf earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.\nOur corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target. In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India. There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama. In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. Our collaboration partners and important vendors and suppliers to us or our collaboration partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and pandemics any of which could harm our business (including, for example, by disrupting supply chains important to the success of our business), results of operations and financial condition. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.", "PERMNO": 80539, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NKTR"}
