{"cik": "1070081", "company": "PTC THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur significant expenses in connection with the continued expansion of our global operations and execution of our commercial strategy for Translarna\u2122 (ataluren) in European Economic Area and other territories, our efforts to obtain broader and additional regulatory approvals for Translarna, and the development of our product pipeline. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $422.6 million. We have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, the private placements of our preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt, convertible debt financings, and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe are a growing commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, but prior to 2014 we devoted substantially all of our efforts on research and development, including clinical trials. In August 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Translarna\u2122 (ataluren) for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The marketing is subject to annual review and renewal by the EMA following its reassessment of the risk-benefit balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial, during 2015. See \"Business-Regulation in the European Union on page 40\" and \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates on page 77\" for further detail regarding the EMA's approval process, including a description of the risk-benefit balance.\nThe marketing authorization described above allows us to market Translarna in the 31 member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. We commenced our commercial launch of Translarna in Germany in December 2014 and we expect to commercially launch in other key countries in the EEA throughout 2015 and beyond, subject to completion of pricing and reimbursement negotiations. Concurrently, in preparation for a potential U.S. launch in the first half of 2016, we have begun building out our commercial team and infrastructure in the U.S. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with the expansion of our global infrastructure as we continue to establish an international presence and our efforts to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including significant sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, and distribution and manufacturing expenses.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with our ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and nmCF as well as our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for nmMPS I. We also expect to incur ongoing research and\ndevelopment expenses for Translarna in additional indications as well as for our other product candidates, including in connection with our Phase 1 clinical study under our cancer stem cell program, which is planned to initiate in the first half of 2015, and our IND-enabling studies under our antibacterial program. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in connection with our rolling NDA submission with the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our currently anticipated submission of a marketing authorization variation with the EMA to seek to include Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the second half of 2015. We have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA and we may also seek marketing approval for Translarna for other indications. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\n\u2022 initiate or continue the research and development of Translarna for additional indications and of our other product candidates;\n\u2022 seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to generate profits from operations and become and remain profitable depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n\u2022 successfully completing confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of either or both of nmDMD and nmCF and successfully initiating clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of additional indications, including nmMPS I, and successfully advancing our other programs and collaborations, including our cancer stem cell, antibacterial and SMA programs;\n\u2022 establishing a global commercial infrastructure, including the sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to effectively market and sell Translarna in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world;\n\u2022 successfully implementing marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u2022 negotiating and securing adequate pricing and reimbursement terms on a timely basis, or at all, in the countries in which we have and may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 negotiating and securing adequate reimbursement from other third-party payors for Translarna;\n\u2022 launching commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in accordance with our estimated timeline;\n\u2022 maintaining the marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and satisfying all related conditions and ongoing requirements;\n\u2022 identifying patients eligible for treatment with Translarna;\n\u2022 obtaining approval to market Translarna for the treatment of other indications, and expanding the territories in which we are approved to market Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022 expanding the approved product label of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022 protecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio related to Translarna; and\n\u2022 contracting for the manufacture of commercial quantities of Translarna;\nWe may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect to incur significant expenses related to the establishment of an expanded international presence and the commercialization of Translarna, including costs related to product sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, and distribution and manufacturing, which may further increase as we expand the geographic area covered by our commercial launch and in the event we receive additional approvals for the use of Translarna or any of our other product candidates. In addition, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and nmCF and our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of Translarna in nmMPS and our IND-enabling studies under our antibacterial program and prepare to commence our Phase 1 clinical study for PTC596 under our cancer stem cell program. We also expect to initiate proof-of-concept studies for Translarna in at least one additional indication during 2015. Furthermore, since the closing of our initial public offering in June 2013, we have begun to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from our public offerings of common stock, marketable securities and research funding that we expect to receive under our collaborations, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through late 2017. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the progress and results of confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna for nmDMD and nmCF as well as our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for nmMPS I and our planned Phase 1 clinical study under our cancer stem cell program;\n\u2022 the scope, costs and timing of the expansion of our commercial infrastructure, including in connection with the growth of our international presence, in Europe and in other territories;\n\u2022 the scope, costs and timing of our commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, legal, regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, in the European Economic Area for nmDMD and any of our other product candidates that may receive marketing approval or any additional indications or territories in which we receive authorization to market Translarna;\n\u2022 the timing and costs related to our rolling NDA submission with the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our currently anticipated submission of a marketing authorization variation with the EMA to seek to include Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the second half of 2015;\n\u2022 the timing and scope of growth in our employee base;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for Translarna for additional indications and for our other product candidates;\n\u2022 the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of Translarna and our other product candidates;\n\u2022 revenue received from commercial sales of Translarna or any of our other product candidates;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies; and\n\u2022 our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, including our collaborations with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or the SMA Foundation, and our ability to obtain research funding and achieve milestones under these agreements.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales for certain product candidates or indications. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success, including Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.\nWe are continuing to engage in significant commercialization efforts for Translarna for nmDMD throughout the EEA. We commenced our commercial launch of Translarna in Germany in December 2014 and we expect to commercially launch in other key countries in the EEA throughout 2015 and beyond, subject to completion of pricing and reimbursement negotiations. In the third quarter of 2014, we began to recognize revenue for payments received under reimbursed early access programs for Translarna for nmDMD patients in selected countries. We expect that our commercial revenue generated in the next several years will be derived exclusively from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and other indications, if any, that may receive marketing authorization and that commercial sales will generally be limited to countries in the European Economic Area and other territories in which we have obtained marketing authorization and reimbursement approval or are permitted to initiate treatment under reimbursed early access programs or pursuant to other procedures. Other commercial revenue, if any, would be derived from sales of products that we are not planning to have commercially available for several years, if at all.\nAccordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing in connection with our continuing operations and to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or based on strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings; debt financings; collaborations; strategic alliances; grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates; and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants\nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates; or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for our stockholders to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe commenced our commercial launch of Translarna in Germany in December 2014 and in the third quarter of 2014 we began to recognize revenue for payments received under reimbursed early access programs for Translarna for nmDMD patients in selected countries. Prior to such time, our operations were limited to organizing and staffing our company, developing and securing our technology, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, and preparing for the commercial launch of Translarna for nmDMD in Europe. We are in the process of transitioning from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting global commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. Other than with respect to the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in August 2014 for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which is subject to annual EMA reassessment until we fulfill certain obligations, we have not proven our ability to successfully obtain marketing approvals to sell our product or product candidates. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to complete development of product candidates, manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for a successful full scale product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions our stockholders make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be subject to annual limitations under federal and state tax law that could materially affect our ability to utilize such losses and attributes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 382, the corporation's ability to utilize any net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain tax credits and other attributes generated before such an ownership change, is limited. We believe that we have in the past experienced ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 that have resulted in limitations under Section 382 (and similar state provisions) on the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes. Future changes in ownership could result in additional ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 that could further limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the Unites States and various foreign jurisdictions. Taxes will be incurred as income is earned among these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in accounting standards, future levels of research and\ndevelopment spending, changes in the mix and level of pre-tax earnings by taxing jurisdiction, the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other jurisdictions, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits, the realization of deferred tax assets, or by changes to our ownership or capital structure. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors and others may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and Product Candidates\nWe depend heavily on the success of our lead product, Translarna, which we are developing for nmDMD, nmCF and nmMPS I. All of our other product candidates are still in early clinical or preclinical development. If we are unable to execute our commercial strategy for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the European Economic Area, fail to receive regulatory approval in the United States and other territories, fail to maintain or satisfy the conditions of our marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or if we experience significant delays in accomplishing such goals, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Translarna for nmDMD and nmCF and are initiating a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in nmMPS I. Our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of Translarna. In August 2014, Translarna was granted marketing authorization in the EEA for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged 5 years and older, which is subject to annual EMA reassessment and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report in 2015. Translarna is still under investigation for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States and has not been approved by the FDA. If we do not successfully commercialize Translarna in the EEA or receive regulatory approval in the United States for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and subsequently successfully commercialize Translarna in the United States, our ability to generate additional revenue will be jeopardized and, consequently, our business will be materially harmed.\nThe success of Translarna will depend on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n\u2022 successful completion of confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna in nmDMD and nmCF and the successful advancement of Translarna in additional indications, in particular, nmMPS I;\n\u2022 the establishment of an expanded international commercial infrastructure capable of supporting product sales, marketing and distribution of Translarna;\n\u2022 implementing marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u2022 the continued maintenance of, and satisfaction of the conditions under, the marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the European Economic Area;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort early access programs on adequate terms;\n\u2022 whether and when we obtain marketing approval of Translarna in additional territories and for additional or expanded indications;\n\u2022 successful negotiation of adequate pricing and reimbursement terms on a timely basis, or at all, in the countries which require such negotiation and in which we obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 the timing and scope of the commercial launch of Translarna in nmDMD;\n\u2022 establishing and maintaining commercial manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers;\n\u2022 the ability of our third-party manufacturers to successfully produce commercial and clinical supplies of Translarna on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our commercial and clinical activities;\n\u2022 successful identification of eligible patients;\n\u2022 acceptance of Translarna in nmDMD by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022 effectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile of Translarna;\n\u2022 obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity; and\n\u2022 protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to continue to commercialize Translarna, which would materially harm our business.\nThe marketing authorization granted by the European Commission for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is subject to the satisfaction of specific conditions and is limited to ambulatory patients aged five years and older located in the European Economic Area, which significantly limits an already small treatable patient population, reduces our commercial opportunities, and is subject to an annual reassessment of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD because the number of patients who could benefit from treatment with Translarna is small. The marketing label approved by the European Commission further limits the currently treatable patient population to ambulatory nmDMD patients aged five years and older who have been identified through genetic testing. Overall, we estimate that the potential opportunity for a treatment for nmDMD is approximately 7,000 patients worldwide including 2,000 patients in the United States, 2,500 patients in the European Union and 2,500 patients in the rest-of-world including Latin America, Japan and Australia. We estimate that approximately 40% of nmDMD patients are ambulatory and at least five years old. Our estimates of both the number of people who have DMD caused by a nonsense mutation, as well as the subset of people with nmDMD who are ambulatory and at least five years old, are based on our beliefs and estimates derived from a variety of sources and may prove to be incorrect. Information concerning the eligible patient population is generally limited to certain geographies and may not employ definitive measures capable of establishing with precision the actual number of nmDMD patients in such geography. If the market opportunities for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD are smaller than we believe they are, our business and anticipated revenues will be negatively impacted. Although we intend to seek to expand the approved product label of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the future, the timing of, and our ability to generate, the necessary data or results required to obtain expanded regulatory approval is currently uncertain. Given the small number of patients who have nmDMD, and the smaller number of patients who meet the criteria for treatment under our current marketing authorization, our commercial opportunity is limited. It is critical to the commercial success of Translarna for nmDMD that we successfully identify and treat these patients.\nIn addition, the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission is subject to annual review and renewal by the EMA following its reassessment of the risk-benefit balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annul EMA reassessment, and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report, which must include additional efficacy and safety data from the trial in 2015, and implement measures, including pharmacovigilance plans, that are detailed in the risk management plan. We submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the\nEMA in February 2015. We plan to seek to renew the marketing authorization on an annual basis until we have satisfied the conditions of the marketing authorization and a full marketing authorization is granted. If we fail to satisfy such requirements, or if it is determined that the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna changes materially, the European Commission could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials, any of which would negatively impact our anticipated revenue from Translarna and materially harm our business. See \"Business-Regulation in the European Union on page 40\" and \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates on page 77\" for further detail regarding the EMA's approval process, including a description of the risk-benefit balance.\nIf clinical trials of our product or product candidates, such as our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna, fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the EMA or FDA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Translarna or any other product candidate.\nIn connection with seeking marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nFor example, we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint with the pre-specified level of statistical significance in a Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD that we completed in 2010 or in a Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF that we completed in 2011. Although we believe that the collective data from these trials, including retrospective and subgroup analyses that we have performed, provide strong support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials, we may similarly fail to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in ACT DMD and ACT CF, our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna for these indications. If the results of our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials are not favorable, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials at significant cost or altogether abandon development of Translarna for either or both of nmDMD and nmCF. We also did not achieve the primary objective in one of four prior Phase 2 clinical trials that we conducted for Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in which we measured change in chloride conductance in nasal cells over the course of treatment.\nFurther, the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission is subject to an annual EMA reassessment and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial, during 2015. If the results of ACT DMD are not favorable, if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the marketing authorization, or if it is determined that the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna changes materially, the European Commission could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials. See \"Business-Regulation in the European Union on page 40\" and \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates on page 77\" for further detail regarding the EMA's approval process, including a description of the risk-benefit balance. We also sell Translarna under reimbursed early access programs in a limited number of countries and there is no assurance that such sales will\ncontinue to be authorized in any particular country. If any of these events were to occur, they would negatively impact our anticipated revenue from Translarna and could materially harm our business.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of Translarna or any other product candidate that we develop beyond those that we contemplate; if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing; if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive; or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022 be unable to successfully renew our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates or additional authorizations for our product;\n\u2022 not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022 be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or restrictions; or\n\u2022 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product or product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product or product candidates, including:\n\u2022 clinical trials of our product or product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022 we may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u2022 our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022 regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022 we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022 we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product or product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials of our product or product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022 the supply or quality of our product or product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product or product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; or\n\u2022 our product or product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product or product candidates, allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, or impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product or product candidates, and so may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur conclusions regarding the activity and potential efficacy of Translarna in our completed Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for nmCF are based on retrospective analyses of the results of these trials and nominal p-values, which are generally considered less reliable indicators of efficacy than pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values.\nAfter determining that we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint with the pre-specified level of statistical significance in our completed Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for nmCF, we performed retrospective and subgroup analyses that we believe provide strong support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials. Although we believe that these additional analyses of the results of these trials were warranted, a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. Some of our favorable statistical data from these trials also are based on nominal p-values that reflect only one particular comparison when more than one comparison is possible, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed. Nominal p-values cannot be compared to the benchmark p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups or analyses of subgroups.\nBecause of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greater weight to results from pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values. This diminishes the likelihood that the EMA will approve our request of a variation to our marketing authorization for Translarna to include Translarna for nmCF on a conditional basis, and, even if we successfully complete our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials, could negatively impact the evaluation by the EMA or the FDA of our anticipated applications for full marketing approval for Translarna for the applicable indication.\nOur confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna for nmDMD and nmCF, even if successfully completed, may not be sufficient for approval of Translarna for the applicable indication.\nIt is possible that the EMA or the FDA may not consider the results of our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna for nmDMD or nmCF, once completed and even if successful, to be sufficient for approval of Translarna for such indication. The FDA typically requires two adequate and well-controlled pivotal clinical trials to support marketing approval of a product candidate for a particular indication. The EMA or the FDA could determine that the results of our trials are not sufficiently robust, are subject to confounding factors or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints. In addition, although we have had discussions with the FDA regarding our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF, the FDA may not consider our proposed trial design acceptable. For example, in 2012, the FDA indicated that in its view the data from our\ncompleted Phase 3 clinical trial and other data from our development program in cystic fibrosis do not by themselves support an NDA submission and, consequently, the FDA informed us that additional clinical data would be required to establish the evidence necessary to support eventual filing of an NDA for the use of Translarna to treat nmCF. We had additional interactions with the FDA in 2013 regarding the clinical development design which would have the potential to support an NDA, but we did not achieve a consensus between the EMA and FDA views. While we have incorporated feedback from the FDA into our ACT CF trial design, we believe that certain key recommendations from the FDA are not appropriate. Two of the key recommendations that we are in disagreement with are the designation of FEV1, CF pulmonary exacerbations and body mass index as three co-primary endpoints for the trial and a suggested three-year trial duration. FEV1 is the primary endpoint in ACT CF, with CF pulmonary exacerbations and body mass index key secondary endpoints, which is consistent with other clinical trials currently ongoing in cystic fibrosis and FDA's earlier recommendation. Additionally, we believe that extending the study duration to three years would result in a number of complications that would ultimately limit the robustness of the data and conclusions that could be drawn from the results. Based on these interactions, we nonetheless initiated ACT CF in the first half of 2014 consistent with feedback from the EMA on our trial design. If the FDA does not consider our trial designs acceptable, we may need to conduct more than one confirmatory clinical trial and our ability to receive marketing approval for this indication could be delayed or prevented.\nBecause we are developing our product and product candidates for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and, in some cases, using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the outcome of our clinical trials will not be favorable.\nThere are no marketed therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of nmDMD or nmCF. In addition, there has been limited historical clinical trial experience generally for the development of drugs to treat either of these diseases. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for these diseases, particularly for drugs to address the underlying nonsense mutations causing these diseases in some subsets of patients, is subject to increased risk.\nPrior to our conducting the Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD, there was no established precedent for an appropriate trial design to evaluate the efficacy of Translarna for nmDMD, and little clinical experience in the methodologies used to analyze the resulting data. Although we believe that we now understand the issues of concern with the pre-specified statistical analyses of our Phase 2b clinical trial results, and that we have designed our confirmatory Phase 3 ACT DMD clinical trial of Translarna in an appropriate fashion, we may nonetheless experience similar or other unknown complications with ACT DMD because of the limited clinical experience in this indication. As a result, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance in ACT DMD, which would make approval of Translarna for this indication unlikely. Among other endpoints in ACT DMD, the trial protocol includes two secondary endpoints that have not been used previously as outcome measures in published therapeutic clinical trials of nmDMD. These endpoints, in particular, may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with other trial results.\nWith regard to nmCF, we believe that we now understand subgroup effects that we observed in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial and that we have designed our confirmatory Phase 3 ACT CF clinical trial of Translarna to take these effects into account. However, we may nonetheless experience unknown complications with ACT CF. As a result, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance in ACT CF, which would make approval of Translarna for this indication unlikely.\nWe are faced with similar challenges in connection with the design of our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of Translarna in nmMPS I because there is also limited historical clinical trial experience for the development of drugs to treat the underlying cause of this disorder. While clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapies conducted by third parties have provided some insight into the disorder, enzyme replacement therapies do not sufficiently address the central nervous system, skeletal or cardiac\nsymptoms associated with the disorder. In addition, our own pre-clinical and early stage clinical trials targeting nmMPS I have been limited in duration and, as a result, it is substantially uncertain whether our clinical design will optimize the duration or level of dosing or that we will be able to demonstrate a statistically significant biochemical or clinical effect in the primary or secondary pre-specified endpoints selected for the study.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including our confirmatory Phase 3 ACT CF clinical trial of Translarna or our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of Translarna in nmMPS I, if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials. For example, nmCF and nmMPS I are characterized by relatively small patient populations, which could result in slow enrollment of clinical trial participants. In addition, our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates. As a result, potential clinical trial sites may elect to dedicate their limited resources to participation in our competitors' clinical trials and not ours, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' product candidates.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022 severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022 eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022 perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022 patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022 the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022 proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna in nmCF, our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of Translarna in nmMPS I or any of our other clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. In addition, we intend to submit a variation to our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA in the second half of 2015 to seek approval for the treatment of nmCF. Although we plan to submit the variation with the clinical results achieved in our prior Phase 3 clinical trial in nmCF, we believe that the CHMP will consider it important that ACT CF be well underway prior to our submission. As a result, enrollment delays in ACT CF could also delay the timeline for our planned submission with the EMA. In addition, we expect that even if the EMA approves a variance to include Translarna for nmCF, any such approval will be subject to the same types of conditions that apply to our marketing authorization in nmDMD, including our ability to provide comprehensive clinical data from a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial. As a result, ACT CF enrollment delays could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain and maintain any marketing authorization for nmCF that may be granted in the future, if any.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of Translarna or any other product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product or product candidate.\nAll of our products and product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove\neffective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. If our product or product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound.\nFor example, although we did not observe a pattern of liver enzyme elevations in our Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna, we did observe modest elevations of liver enzymes in some subjects in one of our Phase 1 clinical trials. These elevated enzyme levels did not require cessation of Translarna administration, and enzyme levels typically normalized after completion of the treatment phase. We did not observe any increases in bilirubin, which can be associated with serious harm to the liver, in the Phase 1 clinical trial.\nIn addition, in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF, five adverse events in the Translarna arm of the trial that involved the renal system led to discontinuation. As compared to the placebo group, the Translarna treatment arm also had a higher incidence of adverse events of creatinine elevations, which can be an indication of impaired kidney function. In the Translarna treatment arm, more severe clinically meaningful creatinine elevations were reported in conjunction with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. These creatinine elevations were associated with concomitant treatment with antibiotics associated with impaired kidney functions, such as aminoglycosides or vancomycin. This led to the subsequent prohibition of concomitant use of Translarna and these antibiotics, which was successful in addressing this issue in the clinical trial. If patients in the Translarna arm of a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of nmCF exhibit clinically meaningful creatinine elevations, the EMA or the FDA might not approve Translarna for this indication or could require that we instruct physicians to frequently monitor patients for these abnormalities or impose other conditions, which may be an impediment to the use of Translarna because of concerns related to its safety and convenience.\nOur focus on the discovery and development of product candidates that target post-transcriptional control processes is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value.\nOur scientific approach focuses on the discovery and development of product candidates that target post-transcriptional control processes. While a number of commonly used drugs and a growing body of research validate the importance of post-transcriptional control processes in the origin and progression of a number of diseases, no existing drugs have been specifically designed to alter post-transcriptional control processes in the same manner as Translarna or our other product candidates. As a result, our focus on targeting these processes may not result in the discovery and development of commercially viable drugs that safely and effectively treat genetic disorders or other diseases. In addition, although we have received marketing authorization by the European Commission for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, such marketing authorization is subject to annual EMA reassessment, and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial, in 2015. We may not be successful in developing and receiving full regulatory approval for such use and we may not receive regulatory approval for additional indications for Translarna or any other potentially commercially viable drug that treats an approved indication by targeting a particular post-transcriptional control process. Furthermore, we may not receive regulatory approval for product candidates that target different post-transcriptional control processes. If we fail to develop and commercialize viable drugs, we will not achieve commercial success.\nTranslarna for the treatment of nmDMD, or any other product candidate that receives marketing approval, if any, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nAlthough Translarna is currently authorized by the EMA for marketing for the treatment of nmDMD, Translarna and any of our other product candidates that may receive marketing approval may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022 the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022 convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022 the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022 any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications, such as a restriction that nmCF patients taking Translarna not also use chronic inhaled aminoglycoside antibiotics.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of Translarna or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing approval.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in our continuing efforts to commercialize Translarna or commercializing any other product candidate if and when they are approved.\nWe have limited experience in the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical products, and we may be unable to successfully execute our commercial strategy in the EEA or, if approved, in the U.S. or other territories. Our commercial strategy for Translarna involves the development of a commercial infrastructure that spans multiple jurisdictions. In preparation for a potential U.S. launch in the first half of 2016, we are evaluating our commercial strategy and have begun building out our commercial team and infrastructure in the U.S. Our ability to successfully commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other territories, including the U.S., if approved, is heavily dependent upon our ability to continue to build an infrastructure that is capable of implementing our global commercial strategy. International operations are subject to inherent risks. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to develop our commercial organizations in all intended territories in a timely manner or at all. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions, including restrictions on advertising practices, enforcement of intellectual property rights, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply\nwith such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize Translarna in those jurisdictions in which it is or may be approved will be adversely affected. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue consistent with our expectations and may not become profitable.\nWe have evaluated markets outside of the EEA to determine in which geographies we might, if approved, choose to commercialize Translarna ourselves and in which geographies we might choose to collaborate with third parties. We intend to continue to promote Translarna in the EEA and in other permitted territories using both internal and external resources. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training an internal commercial team is expensive and time consuming and could delay our commercialization efforts for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or any other product launch. If the commercial launch of Translarna or any other product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition such personnel.\nThe arrangements that we have entered into, or may enter into, with third parties to perform sales and marketing services will generate lower product revenues or profitability of product revenues to us than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022 our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022 our inability to implement third party marketing and distribution relationships in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n\u2022 the inability of our commercial team to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe Translarna or any future products;\n\u2022 the lack of complementary products to be offered by our commercial team, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercial organization.\nWe plan to develop our commercial strategy for additional indications for Translarna or other product candidates, if and when such drugs are approved in the applicable region.\nWe expect that during 2015 all of our sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD will occur in territories outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe expect that for at least the next year, all of our revenue from sales of Translarna will be generated from countries other than the United States. Additionally, we have operations in several European countries and other territories. We expect that we will continue to expand our international\noperations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022 changes in international regulatory and compliance requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u2022 financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022 potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u2022 changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022 trade protection measures, including import or export licensing requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022 our ability to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies;\n\u2022 political and economic instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022 diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022 differing labor regulations and business practices; and\n\u2022 regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors' and service providers' activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act or similar local regulation.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nThere is currently no marketed therapy, other than Translarna in the EEA, which has received approval for the treatment of the underlying cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Other currently available treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy are only palliative. However, there are other biopharmaceutical companies, including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (following its acquisition of Prosensa Therapeutic in early 2015) and Sarepta Therapeutics, that are developing treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy based on a different scientific approach known as exon-skipping. Summit Corporation also has a product candidate in early clinical development designed to increase the production of the protein utrophin, which is functionally similar to dystrophin, to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Nobelpharma, a Japanese company, is currently sponsoring a Phase 2 clinical trial in Japan of its product candidate NPC-14 (arbekacin sulfate), which is a generically available aminoglycoside antibiotic, in boys with nmDMD.\nThere are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products to manage the symptoms and side effects of cystic fibrosis. These products include Chiron Corporation's TOBI and Genentech, Inc.'s Pulmozyme. Although there are currently no marketed products approved to treat the underlying cause of nmCF, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' CFTR potentiator drug Kalydeco is approved by the FDA and in other territories as a treatment for cystic fibrosis in patients six years of age and older who have a type of mutation in the CFTR gene known as\na gating mutation. Vertex Pharmaceuticals also is developing two other product candidates for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients who have a type of mutation in the CFTR gene known as a process block mutation. We believe that Translarna is the only product candidate in clinical trials that is designed to treat the underlying cause of nmCF by restoring CFTR activity.\nIn addition, Aldurazyme, which is manufactured by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and sold by Genzyme Corporation, is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nWe believe that many competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for the target indications of our product candidates, including academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller more focused companies.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs.\nEven if we are able to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on a broad scale or commercialize Translarna for other indications or any other product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nWe currently expect that Translarna will be priced at levels consistent with the pricing for other therapies for the treatment of rare disorders where high unmet medical need exists.\nThe regulations and practices that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries, including almost all of the member states of the European Economic Area, require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, including the European market, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize Translarna or any other product candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish\nreimbursement levels. A primary trend in the E.U. and U.S. healthcare industries and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our products can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for Translarna or any other product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for Translarna may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. In addition, in the European Union, for medicines authorized by the centralized authorization procedure, an authorized trader, such as a wholesaler, can purchase a medicine in one European Union member state and import the product into another EU member state. This process is called \"parallel distribution\". As a result, a purchaser in one EU member state may seek to import Translarna from another European Union member state where Translarna is sold at a lower price. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the commercialization of Translarna, any other product that we may commercialize, and in connection with the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials for Translarna and any other product that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u2022 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022 increased insurance costs, or an inability to maintain appropriate insurance coverage;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022 loss of revenue; and\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our commercial sales, sales pursuant to reimbursed early access programs and clinical trials up to a $25.0 million annual aggregate limit, and subject to a per claim deductible. The amount of insurance we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities and defense costs that we may incur. We may need to further increase our insurance coverage as we begin commercializing Translarna or as and when we begin commercializing any other product candidate that receives marketing approval. The cost of insurance coverage is highly variable, based on a wide range of factors and is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability or defense costs that may arise.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations currently, and may in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and medical and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials or disposal of hazardous wastes, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources.\nAlthough we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We also maintain liability insurance for some of these risks, but our policy excludes pollution and has a coverage limit of $10.0 million.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, we initiated separate Phase 2 clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of hemophilia in 2009 and the metabolic disorder methylmalomic acidemia in 2010, but then suspended these clinical trials to focus on the development of Translarna for nmDMD and nmCF when we found variability in the assays used in these trials and preliminary data from these trials did not indicate definitive evidence of activity. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts on small-molecule drugs that target post-transcriptional control processes. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in proprietary technologies, including GEMS and our alternative splicing technology, which we use in the discovery of these molecules, to date we have only been granted marketing authorization to treat nmDMD under a restricted label, and subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, in the European Economic Area. We may not be able to satisfy the conditions of our current marketing authorization for nmDMD, including the completion of ACT DMD, and we may never successfully develop any other marketable drugs or indications using our scientific approach. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our product and product candidates, which may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or development efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production or distribution of clinical or commercial supplies of our product candidates. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Translarna and all of our product candidates. We outsource all manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of our products and product candidates to third parties, including our commercial supply of Translarna.\nWe currently have a contract with a pharmacy and hospital distributor in the EU that distributes Translarna for both commercial and clinical programs. We are finalizing our business relationship with a third party logistics provider in the EU, which we expect to be in place in the first half of 2015.\nWe currently rely on a single source for the production of some of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the bulk drug substance for Translarna from two third-party manufacturers and the bulk drug substance for our antibacterial and oncology programs through another third-party manufacturer. We engage a separate manufacturer to provide bulk drug product and expect to finalize our validation of another bulk drug manufacturer in mid-2015. We engage a separate manufacturer to provide fill and finish services for our finished commercial and clinical product and are in the process of completing arrangements with two additional providers to provide these services, initially for our clinical product in early to mid-2015, with commercial product services expected to commence for at least one provider in late 2015. We do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of Translarna or any of our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to conclude agreements for commercial or clinical supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers and distributors, reliance on such service providers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022 the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022 the possibility of commercial supplies of Translarna not being distributed to commercial vendors or end users in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales;\n\u2022 the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions; and\n\u2022 the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nMany additional factors could cause production or distribution interruptions with the manufacture and distribution of Translarna and any of our product candidates, including human error, natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, equipment malfunctions, contamination, or raw material shortages.\nIn addition, third-party manufacturers or distributors may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, or good distribution practice, or GDP, or similar regulatory requirements outside the European Union and the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers or distributors, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or product, operating restrictions, criminal prosecutions or debarment, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of Translarna or our product candidates.\nOur product and product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nIf the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our commercial sales, preclinical tests and clinical trials should, prior to the time that we have validated alternative providers, cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply Translarna to patients or in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of Translarna or our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, we will lose commercial sales revenue and it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture and distribution of Translarna and our product candidates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth including our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize our products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product or product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical\ninstitutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Similar GCP and transparency requirements apply in the European Union. Failure to comply with such requirements, including with respect to clinical trials conducted outside the European Union and United States, can also lead regulatory authorities to refuse to take into account clinical trial data submitted as part of a marketing application.\nFor example, in the first half of 2013 inspectors acting at the request of the EMA conducted GCP inspections of selected clinical sites from our completed Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our clinical trial site relating to our then pending MAA for approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following these inspections, we received inspection reports containing a combination of critical and major findings. These findings related to waivers we granted to admit patients to our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in advance of formal approval of protocol amendments that would have established their eligibility for the trial, as well as our oversight of our trial sites and the completeness or sufficiency of clinical trial documentation. In response to these findings, we described to the EMA the enhanced internal procedures and controls we have implemented, and the internal quality assurance department we have established, since the conclusion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, we proposed corrective action plans to address the inspectors' specific findings. If we do not meet our commitment to the corrective actions we proposed to the EMA, we may face additional consequences, including rejection of data or other direct action by national regulatory authorities, which could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other supportive studies to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain full approval from the EMA.\nFurthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approvals of our product or product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nFor each of our product candidates, we plan to evaluate the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves or entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, such as our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, for our spinal muscular atrophy program. We have entered into arrangements with certain third parties to market or distribute Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in certain countries and, as we continue to implement our commercialization plans for Translarna, we anticipate that we will engage additional third parties to perform these functions for us in other countries. We generally plan to seek collaborators for the development and commercialization of product candidates that have high anticipated development costs, are directed at indications for which a potential collaborator has a particular expertise, or involve markets that require a large sales and marketing organization to serve effectively. Our likely collaborator(s) for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements may include: large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and/or biotechnology companies.\nWe will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' desire and abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. In particular, the successful development of a product candidate from our spinal muscular atrophy program will initially depend on the success of our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, including whether Roche continues clinical development of the current clinical candidate or pursues clinical development of any other compounds identified under the collaborations.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates, including our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022 collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022 collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs, based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators' strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022 collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022 a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022 disputes may arise between the collaborator and us as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration;\n\u2022 we may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022 disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022 collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaborators have terminated collaborations with us in the past. For example, in 2008, we entered into a collaboration with Genzyme Corporation for the development and commercialization of Translarna under which we granted to Genzyme rights to commercialize Translarna in all countries other than the United States and Canada. In 2011, we restructured the collaboration and regained worldwide rights to Translarna, with Genzyme obtaining an option to commercialize Translarna in indications other than nmDMD outside the United States and Canada. In 2012, this option expired without being exercised by Genzyme and the collaboration terminated.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate further with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge; and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under such license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose rights in important intellectual property or technology.\nWe have also received grant funding for some of our development programs from philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups pursuant to agreements that impose development and commercialization diligence obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the applicable organization could require us to grant to the organization exclusive rights under certain of our intellectual property, which could materially adversely affect the value to us of product candidates covered by that intellectual property even if we are entitled to a share of any consideration received by such organization in connection with any subsequent development or commercialization of the product candidates.\nSome of our patented technology was developed with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \"march-in\" rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. Furthermore, our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and certain restrictions on manufacturing products outside the United States.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering this intellectual property. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, in these circumstances, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, patent law in many countries restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party submission of prior art to a patent office or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. In addition, other companies may attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, which may require us to allocate significant resources to preventing such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data submitted as part of an MAA becoming publicly available. Such developments could enable other companies to circumvent our intellectual property rights and use our clinical trial data to obtain marketing authorizations in the European Union and in other jurisdictions. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain our patents.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as we gain greater visibility as a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. We may not be\naware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates. For example, we have not conducted a recent freedom-to-operate search or analysis for Translarna\u2122 (brand name of ataluren). Any freedom-to-operate search or analysis previously conducted may not have uncovered all relevant patents and patent applications, and there may be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing Translarna. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether Translarna, any other product candidate, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe any third party's intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nFor example, it is possible that one or more third parties might bring a patent infringement or other legal proceeding against us regarding Translarna. We are aware of an issued U.S. patent and international patent applications that purport to disclose or contain claims to chemical scaffolds that are sufficiently broad that they could be read to encompass Translarna, even though neither the issued U.S. patent nor any of the international patent applications specifically discloses Translarna. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any issued U.S. patent, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. This burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of these claims. There is no assurance that a court would find these claims to be invalid. In addition, we believe that our testing of Translarna in clinical trials for the purpose of seeking FDA approval would be a valid defense against any infringement claims in the United States based on the availability of a statutory exemption. However, there can be no assurance that our interpretation of the statutory exemption would be upheld, and the statutory exemption would only cover our preclinical research activities, and not the commercialization of Translarna.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur trademark applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such\nproceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would.\nIf we are not able to obtain adequate trademark protection or regulatory approval for our brand names, including Translarna, we may be required to re-brand affected products, which could cause delays in getting such products to market and substantially increase our costs.\nAny trademark we intend to use for our product candidates, including Translarna, will require that we seek trademark registration worldwide. Trademark registration is a territory-specific and we must apply for registration in the US as well as any other country where we intend to commercialize product. Failure to obtain the appropriate registrations may place our use of the trademark at risk or make if subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose an alternative name for our product candidates. In addition, the FDA, and other regulatory authorities outside the United States, typically conduct a separate review of proposed product names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names or medication or prescribing errors. These regulatory authorities may also object to any product name we submit if they believe the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA or other competent regulatory authority outside the United States objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative name, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or approval or related legal challenges or because of objections from regulatory authorities, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate, and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA or applicable other regulatory authority, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and Product Candidates\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to continue to commercialize Translarna for nmDMD or other indications or commercialize our other product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nTranslarna and our other product candidates, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and EMA and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate.\nWe have received marketing authorization to market Translarna for nmDMD in the European Economic Area, which is subject to annual EMA reassessment and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial, during 2015. We have not otherwise received marketing approval for Translarna or any of our other product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We intend to submit a variation to our marketing authorization application with the EMA to seek to include Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in the second half of 2015. There is substantial risk that the EMA will not grant us approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF. We expect that even if the EMA approves a variance to include Translarna for nmCF, any such approval will be subject to the same types of conditions that apply to our marketing authorization in nmDMD, including our ability to provide comprehensive clinical data from a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial, such as ACT CF.\nWe have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA. In December 2014, we commenced a rolling basis submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. We may not receive necessary approvals from the FDA or other regulators to further commercialize Translarna or any product candidate in any market.\nWe have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that Translarna or any of our other product candidates are not effective or only moderately effective, or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nFor example, our ability to obtain and maintain marketing authorizations granted on a conditional basis in the European Union is limited to specific circumstances and subject to several conditions and obligations. Conditional marketing authorizations based on incomplete clinical data may be granted for a limited number of listed medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under E.U. law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Marketing authorizations subject to conditions are only valid for one year, and must be renewed annually by the EMA after an assessment of the risk-benefit balance and need for additional or modified conditions.\nIn addition, marketing approvals in countries outside the United States do not ensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing approvals and pricing approvals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for their products that are the same drug as our product candidates, or can be classified as a similar medicinal product within the meaning of E.U. law, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. We have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, nmCF, and nmMPS I. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable market exclusivity period is ten years in the European Union and seven years in the United States. The E.U. exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nIn the European Union, a \"similar medicinal product\" is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. For a drug such as Translarna, which is composed of small molecules, the FDA defines \"same drug\" as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for Translarna for these indications, both in the European Union and in the United States, may be important to the product candidate's success. If a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for and approval of a product with the same indication as Translarna before we do and if the competitor's product is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from the market. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for Translarna for these indications, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as Translarna is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product that is the same drug as Translarna if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. The same considerations would apply to any of our product candidates.\nThe fast track designation for Translarna may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. We have obtained a fast track designation from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. However, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw our fast track designation if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Our fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the FDA's expedited review procedures, nor does it increase the likelihood of FDA approval.\nMarketed pharmaceutical products, including Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, are subject to extensive and rigorous governmental regulation and could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nThe company, Translarna, our product candidates, our operations, our facilities, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers, distributors, and contract testing laboratories are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the EEA, the United States, and other territories, with regulations differing from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the EEA, the United States, or other territories until we have received requisite regulatory approvals. In order to receive and maintain such approvals, we and our third-party service providers must comply on a continuous basis with a broad array of regulations related to establishment registration and product listing, manufacturing processes, risk management measures, quality and pharmacovigilance systems, pre- and post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, record keeping, distribution, and import and export of pharmaceutical products for any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Any regulatory approval of any of our products or product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. For example, our marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual EMA reassessment and is further conditioned on our ability to complete ACT DMD and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial, during 2015. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing and distribution.\nWe are required to submit safety and other post-market information and reports, implement pharmacovigilance plans, and comply with cGMP requirements related to manufacturing including, quality control, quality assurance and complaints and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to healthcare professionals and recordkeeping, among other things, in connection with the marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD described above. Regulatory authorities, including the EMA and local regulatory authorities in EEA member states, subject a marketed product, its manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities to ongoing review and periodic inspections and the EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections, undertaken by the competent authorities of applicable member states, of our manufacturing facilities to assess whether our manufacturing, and other procedures, comply with cGMP. Similar regulatory and inspection requirements apply in other jurisdictions including those imposed by the FDA in the United States.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or may be subject to significant conditions of approval, including the requirement of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS. A regulatory authority also may impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. In addition, the competent authorities of each EU member state and the FDA closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. Such regulatory authorities can impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and if we do not comply with the laws governing promotion of approved drugs, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to civil and criminal penalties, investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results which could negatively affect our business, including:\n\u2022 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 changes to or restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022 restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022 requirements to implement a REMS;\n\u2022 requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 warning or untitled letters;\n\u2022 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022 recall of products;\n\u2022 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022 suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022 product seizure;\n\u2022 injunctions;\n\u2022 the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\n\u2022 debarment.\nNon-compliance with E.U. requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union's requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nWe are also subject to laws and license and registration requirements covering the distribution of marketed products. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may be subject to action by regulatory agencies, which could negatively affect our business. Regulatory agencies may also change existing requirements or adopt new requirements or policies. We may be slow to adapt or may not be able to adapt to these changes or new requirements.\nOur initial commercial launch of Translarna has begun in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna in the European Economic Area and other jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products in such regions.\nIn some countries, particularly the member states of the EEA, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and may have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the country. We generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD pursuant to the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country. In some countries we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies of our product including trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our\nproduct to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. We may not be able to conclude pricing and reimbursement negotiations or comply with additional regulatory requirements in the countries in which we seek to commercialize Translarna on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take over 18 months to complete. Pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Since December 2014, Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD has been commercially available in Germany, but we are still in the process of finalizing our pricing negotiations with relevant German authorities. We cannot predict the timing of Translarna's commercial launch in countries where we are awaiting pricing and reimbursement guidelines. While we have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in key EEA countries, we have not received both pricing and reimbursement approval in any country, and there is no assurance that we will receive such approval or, if we do, that the price, level of reimbursement and other terms will be acceptable to us. In addition, the price that is approved by local governmental authorities pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able to charge for sales under our reimbursed early access programs. In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. In some countries, such as France, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, the company may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. We will make such retroactive reimbursement, if any, following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations and there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the publicly funded health care system in the UK determined to reconsider how it assesses certain new treatments and postponed certain pricing and reimbursement meetings, including meetings related to Translarna.\nReference pricing used by various E.U. member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.\nIf we fail to successfully secure and maintain pricing and reimbursement coverage for Translarna or are significantly delayed in doing so or if burdensome conditions are imposed by private payers, government authorities or other third-party payers on such reimbursement, planned launches in the affected countries will be delayed and our anticipated revenue and growth prospects could be negatively affected and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors are or will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products or product candidates, including Translarna. Our arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFailure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could subject us to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.\nRestrictions and reporting requirements under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and equivalent laws and regulations in the European Union, include, and are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 Anti-corruption and anti-bribery statutes, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act. These statutes are generally broad in scope and will require us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA prohibits the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company.\n\u2022 Anti-kickback statutes, which generally prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under government funded healthcare programs. The U.S. federal statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others and many states have enacted equivalent state laws that apply not only to government payors but commercial payors. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and healthcare laws and regulations.\n\u2022 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the Affordable Care Act), amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute such that a person no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statue or specific intent to violate it.\n\u2022 Laws and regulations, including the U.S. False Claims Act, which impose civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. The U.S. government has brought False Claims Act actions against pharmaceutical companies on the theory that their practices have caused false claims to be submitted to the government. The U.S. Attorneys' Offices and the main Department of Justice have taken broad interpretations of what constitutes falsity or false claims. A wide range of pharmaceutical manufacturers' commercial activity, marketing practices and price reporting practices have been scrutinized as potential violations of the False Claims Act.\n\u2022 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition,\ninternational data protection laws including the European Union Data Protection Directive and member state implementing legislation may apply to some or all of the clinical data obtained outside of the U.S. Furthermore, certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our use and dissemination of individuals' health information.\n\u2022 HIPAA also imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u2022 Laws and regulations regulating off-label promotion. Off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at European Union level and in the individual European Union member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription- only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other laws, if any of our product candidates are approved, we would be prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means, for example, that we would not be able to make claims about the use of our marketed products outside of their approved indications, and we would not be able to proactively discuss or provide information on off-label uses of such products, with very specific and limited exceptions. The FDA does not, however, restrict physicians from prescribing products for off-label uses in the practice of medicine. Should the FDA determine that our activities constituted the promotion of off-label use, the FDA could bring action to prevent us from distributing those products for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA's refusal to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions.\n\u2022 Statutory requirements to disclose publicly payments made to physicians, including in certain European Union member states and the U.S. For example, under federal Physician Sunshine Act requirements, manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies must report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. A number of states have enacted their own transparency requirements that obligate manufacturers to report different types of spending related to physicians and other covered recipients.\n\u2022 Laws governing the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and patients, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, legislation adopted by individual EU member states that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product's Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited.\n\u2022 Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.\nIn addition, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by industry self- regulation codes of conduct and physicians' codes of professional conduct. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national laws of the EU member states, as well as codes of conduct issued by self-regulatory industry bodies. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician's employer, their competent professional organization, and the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws, regulations, transparency requirements and self-regulatory codes will involve substantial costs. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our third-party contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and foreign regulations and codes. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare programs would significantly impact our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any drug. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of Translarna or any of our other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates, including Translarna, for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending,\nenhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Affordable Care Act revised the definition of \"average manufacturer price\" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most elements of the Affordable Care Act in June 2012, other legal challenges are still pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions. In addition, Congress has in the past proposed and likely will continue to propose a number of legislative initiatives challenging various aspects of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to the Affordable Care Act, whether to certain provisions or its entirety. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, which triggered the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In March 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and in April 2013, the 2% Medicare reductions went into effect. In December 2013, Congress amended the Budget Control Act to provide greater discretionary spending in 2014 and 2015 than originally budgeted and provide relief from the FDA user fee for two years; this legislation also extended the prohibition against reducing payments to Medicare providers by more than 2% for two years (i.e., until 2023). In December 2014, Congress passed an omnibus funding bill (the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015) and a tax extenders bill, both of which may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize Translarna and our product candidates. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Dr. Stuart W. Peltz, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and the other principal members of our executive and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe are in the process of expanding our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nIn connection with our commercialization plans and business strategy, including our commercial launch of Translarna, we have experienced and plan to continue to experience significant growth in our employee base for sales, marketing, operational, managerial, financial, human resources, drug development, quality, regulatory and medical affairs and other areas. This growth has and will continue to impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit, hire, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. To manage our recent and anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making\nit more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022 provide for a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022 allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022 limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022 require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022 require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur shares of common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on June 20, 2013. Given the limited trading history of our common stock, there is a risk that an active trading market for our common stock will not be sustained, which could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and thereby affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to advance the commercialization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n\u2022 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of Translarna and any other product candidate that we develop;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022 general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\", as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2018, provided that, if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more in any fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of December 31 of the applicable year. We also would cease to be an emerging growth company if we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies.\nIf the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30, 2015, we will cease to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2015.\nWe are currently incurring and expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nHowever, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies as described in the preceding risk factor. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm until we are no longer an emerging growth company. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. A significant number of our shares are currently \"restricted\" securities as a result of securities laws, but are able to be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal laws with respect to affiliate sales. Moreover, certain holders of an aggregate of 1,894,327 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe have a significant number of restricted stock awards and shares that are subject to outstanding options under our equity compensation plans or as inducement grants to new hire employees pursuant to Nasdaq rules. These shares underlying these awards are or, with respect to certain option grants, will be registered on a Form S-8 registration statement. As a result, upon vesting these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. The exercise of options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock or the sale of restricted stock upon vesting could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nCertain of our employees, executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the employee, officer or director. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers and directors may also buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information. As of February 27, 2015, an aggregate of approximately 184,000 shares of our common stock, including shares of our common stock underlying stock option awards, held by nine of our directors and executive officers were subject to sale under Rule 10b5-1 plans.", "PERMNO": 13967, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTCT"}
