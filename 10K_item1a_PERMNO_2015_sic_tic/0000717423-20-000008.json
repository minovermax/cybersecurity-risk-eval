RISK FACTORS\nVolatility in the global prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nAmong the most significant variable factors impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations are the sales prices for crude oil and natural gas that it produces. The indices against which much of the Company\u2019s production is priced were volatile both in 2019 and 2018 (albeit to a lesser extent in 2019 versus 2018). Crude oil prices in 2019 and 2018 were higher than those in years 2015 to 2017 but were significantly lower than prices in 2013 and 2014. Sales prices for crude oil and natural gas can be significantly different in U.S. markets compared to other international markets.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices averaged approximately $57 in 2019, compared to $65 in 2018, $51 in 2017, and $43 per barrel in 2016. As of February 25, 2020 closing, the NYMEX WTI forward curve price for April through December 2020 was $50. The closing price for WTI at the end of 2019 was approximately $60 per barrel. Certain U.S. and Canadian crude oils are priced from oil indices other than WTI, and these indices are influenced by different supply and demand forces than those that affect the WTI prices. The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company\u2019s crude include Magellan East Houston (MEH), Mars, Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS), and Brent.\nThe average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas sales price was $2.52 in 2019, compared to $3.12 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) in 2018, $2.96 per MMBTU in 2017, and $2.48 per MMBTU in 2016. The closing price for NYMEX natural gas as of December 31, 2019, was $2.19 per MMBTU. The Company also has exposure to the Canadian benchmark natural gas price, AECO, which averaged $1.33 per MMBTU in 2019. The Company has entered into certain forward fixed price contracts as detailed in the Outlook section on page 41 and certain variable netback contracts providing exposure to Malin and Chicago City Gate prices.\nThe Company cannot predict how changes in the sales prices of oil and natural gas will affect the results of operations in future periods. In 2019, the Company hedged a portion of its exposure to the effects of changing prices of crude oil and natural gas by selling forwards, swaps and other forms of derivative contracts. The Company markets a portion of Canadian natural gas production to locations other than AECO and through physical forward sales.\nSee Note M - Financial Instruments and Risk Management for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices.\nLow oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations in several ways in the future.\nLower oil and natural gas prices adversely affect the Company in several ways:\n\u2022\nLower sales value for the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas production reduces cash flows and net income.\n\u2022\nLower cash flows may cause the Company to reduce its capital expenditure program, thereby potentially restricting its ability to grow production and add proved reserves.\n\u2022\nLower oil and natural gas prices could lead to impairment charges in future periods, therefore reducing net income.\n\u2022\nReductions in oil and natural gas prices could lead to reductions in the Company\u2019s proved reserves in future years. Low prices could make a portion of the Company\u2019s proved reserves uneconomic, which in turn could lead to the removal of certain of the Company\u2019s year-end reported proved oil reserves in future periods. These reserve reductions could be significant.\n\u2022\nIn order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain appropriate bank credit facilities. Inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity.\n\u2022\nLower prices for oil and natural gas could cause the Company to lower its dividend because of lower cash flows.\nCertain of these effects are further discussed in risk factors that follow.\nMurphy\u2019s commodity price risk management may limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully benefit from potential future price increases for oil and natural gas.\nThe Company, from time to time, enters into various contracts to protect its cash flows against lower oil and natural gas prices. Because of these contracts, if the prices for oil and natural gas increase in future periods, the Company will not fully benefit from the price improvement on all production.\nMurphy operates in highly competitive environments which could adversely affect it in many ways, including its profitability, cash flows and its ability to grow.\nMurphy operates in the oil and natural gas industry and experiences competition from other oil and natural gas companies, which include state-owned foreign oil companies, major integrated oil companies, private equity investors and independent producers of oil and natural gas. Many of the state-owned and major integrated oil companies and some of the independent producers that compete with the Company have substantially greater resources than Murphy.\nIn addition, the oil industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying energy requirements around the world. Murphy competes, among other things, for valuable acreage positions, exploration licenses, drilling equipment and talent.\nMurphy could face emerging long-term challenges to the fossil fuels business model.\nAs environmental and social trends change towards less carbon intensive energy sources, Murphy\u2019s business model may come under more pressure from changing global demands for non-fossil fuel energy sources. As part of Murphy\u2019s strategy review process, the Company reviews hydrocarbon demand forecasts and assesses the impact on its business model and plans. The Company also has significant natural gas reserves which emit lower carbon compared to oil and liquids.\nThe issue of climate change has caused considerable attention to be directed towards initiatives to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. An international climate agreement (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d) was agreed to at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016, however, after originally entering the agreement the U.S., in 2017 subsequently withdrew from this agreement. The U.S. remains the only country, of the original signatories, not part of the Paris Agreement. It is possible that the Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, and other such initiatives, including foreign, federal and state environmental rules or regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, may reduce the demand for crude oil and natural gas globally. In addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives such as public and private initiatives that aim to subsidize the development of non-fossil fuel energy sources, may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. While the magnitude of any reduction in hydrocarbon demand is difficult to predict, such a development could adversely impact the Company and other companies engaged in the exploration and production business. The Company continually monitors the global climate change agenda initiatives and plans accordingly based on its assessment of such initiatives on its business.\nExploration drilling results can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company drills exploratory wells which subjects its exploration and production operating results to exposure to dry holes expense, which may have adverse effects on, and create volatility for, the Company\u2019s results of operations. In response to lower oil prices in recent years, the Company has reduced its exploration program from pre-2015 levels and currently plans to participate in approximately four exploration wells per year. In 2019, the Company drilled exploration wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Vietnam, and Mexico and experienced a 100% success rate. The Company has budgeted $100 million for its 2020 exploration program, which includes two operated wells offshore Mexico, two non-operated wells (one well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, one well in Brazil; subject to rig availability/timing) and other exploratory spend.\nIf Murphy cannot replace its oil and natural gas reserves, it may not be able to sustain or grow its business.\nMurphy continually depletes its oil and natural gas reserves as production occurs. To sustain and grow its business, the Company must successfully replace the oil and natural gas it produces with additional reserves. Therefore, it must create and maintain a portfolio of good prospects for future reserves additions and production. The Company does this by obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in prospective areas. In addition, it must find, develop and produce and/or acquire reserves at a competitive cost to be successful in the long-term. Murphy\u2019s ability to operate profitably in the exploration and production business, therefore, is dependent on its ability to find (and/or acquire), develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves at costs that are less than the realized sales price for these products.\nIn 2019, the Company, completed a transaction with LLOG Exploration Offshore L.L.C. and LLOG Bluewater Holdings, L.L.C., (LLOG), whereby the Company acquired 26 blocks in the Mississippi Canyon and Green Canyon areas of the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the Company acquired incremental ownership in the Chinook field in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, the Company entered into a transaction among Murphy, PAI and MP Gulf of Mexico, LLC (MP GOM), whereby the Company through its interest in MP GOM acquired an 80% interest in PAI Gulf of Mexico producing Assets (Cascade, Chinook, Lucius, St. Malo, Cottonwood, South Marsh Island, Northwestern, and South Hadrian fields) and its interests in exploration blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to MP GOM.\nMurphy\u2019s proved reserves are based on the professional judgment of its engineers and may be subject to revision.\nProved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas included in this report on pages 94 through 102 have been prepared according to the Securities and Exchange (SEC) guidelines by qualified Company personnel or qualified independent engineers based on an unweighted average of crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the respective year as well as other conditions and information available at the time the estimates were prepared. Estimation of reserves is a subjective process that involves professional judgment by engineers about volumes to be recovered in future periods from underground oil and natural gas reservoirs. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, and consequently, different engineers could arrive at different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data and using industry accepted engineering practices and scientific methods.\nMurphy\u2019s actual future oil and natural gas production may vary substantially from its reported quantity of proved reserves due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nOil and natural gas prices which are materially different from prices used to compute proved reserves\n\u2022\nOperating and/or capital costs which are materially different from those assumed to compute proved reserves\n\u2022\nFuture reservoir performance which is materially different from models used to compute proved reserves, and\n\u2022\nGovernmental regulations or actions which materially impact operations of a field.\nThe Company\u2019s proved undeveloped reserves represent significant portions of total proved reserves. As of December 31, 2019, and including noncontrolling interests, approximately 46% of the Company\u2019s crude oil and condensate proved reserves, 50% of natural gas liquids proved reserves and 38% of natural gas proved reserves are undeveloped. The ability of the Company to reclassify these undeveloped proved reserves to the proved developed classification is generally dependent on the successful completion of one or more operations, which might include further development drilling, construction of facilities or pipelines, and well workovers.\nThe discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves as reported on pages 107 and 108 should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used in the reserves computations.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital, the risks associated with our business and the risk associated with the industry in general.\nCapital financing may not always be available to fund Murphy\u2019s activities; and interest rates could impact cash flows.\nMurphy usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to find and develop reserves before revenue is generated from production. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding requirements may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow generated by operations may not fully cover capital funding requirements, especially in periods of low commodity prices. Therefore, the Company maintains financing arrangements with lending institutions to meet certain funding needs. The Company periodically renews these financing arrangements based on foreseeable financing needs or as they expire. In November 2018, the Company entered into a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility (the \u201cRCF\u201d). The RCF is a senior unsecured guaranteed facility and will expire in November 2023.\nAmounts drawn under the RCF may bear interest in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of rates. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Financial industry working groups are developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate; however, we can provide no assurance that market-accepted rates and transition methodologies will be available and finalized at the time of LIBOR cessation. If clear market standards and transition methodologies have not developed by the time LIBOR becomes unavailable, we may have difficulty reaching agreement on acceptable replacement rates under the RCF. If we are unable to negotiate replacement rates on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nIn November 2019, the Company issued $550 million of new notes that bear interest at a rate of 5.875% and mature on December 1, 2027 and repurchased and canceled $239.7 million of the Company\u2019s 4.00% notes due 2022 and $281.6 million of the Company\u2019s 4.45% notes due 2022 (originally issued as 3.70% notes due 2022) during November and December 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing is also affected by the Company\u2019s debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. A ratings downgrade could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to access debt markets, increase the borrowing cost under the Company\u2019s credit facility and the cost of future debt, and potentially require the Company to post additional letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.\nFurther, changes in economic environments and investors\u2019 view of risk of the exploration and production industry could adversely impact interest rates. This could result in higher interest costs on capital funding lowering net income and cash-flows. Murphy partially manages this risk through borrowing at fixed rates where-ever possible; however, rates determined when refinancing or new capital is required are partly determined through factors outside of Murphy\u2019s control, such as centrally (federal government) set interest rates and investors\u2019 view of the exploration and production industry.\nSee Note H - Financing Arrangements and Debt for information regarding the Company\u2019s outstanding debt and other commitments as of December 31, 2019 and the terms associated therewith.\nMurphy\u2019s operations could be adversely affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe Company\u2019s worldwide operational scope exposes it to risks associated with foreign currencies. Most of the Company\u2019s business is transacted in U.S. dollars, and therefore the Company and most of its subsidiaries are U.S. dollar functional entities for accounting purposes. However, the Canadian dollar is the functional currency for all Canadian operations. This exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar functional currency can lead to impacts on consolidated financial results from foreign currency translation. On occasions, the Canadian business may hold assets or incur liabilities denominated in a currency which is not Canadian dollars which could lead to exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. See also Note M - Financial Instruments and Risk Management in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative contracts.\nThe costs and funding requirements related to the Company\u2019s retirement plans are affected by several factors.\nA number of actuarial assumptions impact funding requirements for the Company\u2019s retirement plans. The most significant of these assumptions include return on assets, long-term interest rates and mortality. If the actual results for the plans vary significantly from the actuarial assumptions used, or if laws regulating such retirement plans are changed, Murphy could be required to make more significant funding payments to one or more of its retirement plans in the future and/or it could be required to record a larger liability for future obligations in its Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nMurphy has limited control over supply chain costs.\nThe Company often experiences pressure on its operating and capital expenditures in periods of strong crude oil and natural gas prices because an increase in exploration and production activities due to high oil and natural gas sales prices generally leads to higher demand for, and consequently higher costs for, goods and services in the oil and natural gas industry. The increase in oil prices in 2017 and 2018 (compared to 2015 to 2016) led to some upward inflation pressure in oil field goods and service costs during those years. In 2019 the cost of goods and services in the oil and natural gas industry were stable.\nMurphy is sometimes reliant on joint venture partners for operating assets, and/or funding development projects and operations.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s major oil and natural gas producing properties are operated by others. Therefore, Murphy does not fully control all activities at certain of its revenue generating properties. During 2019, approximately 16% of the Company\u2019s total production was at fields operated by others, while at December 31, 2019, approximately 14% of the Company\u2019s total proved reserves were at fields operated by others.\nAdditionally, the Company relies on the availability of transportation and processing facilities that are often owned and operated by others. These third-party systems and facilities may not always be available to the Company, and if available, may not be available at a price that is acceptable to the Company.\nSome of Murphy\u2019s development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. As a result, the Company\u2019s partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including financing arrangements. Murphy\u2019s partners are also susceptible to certain of the risk factors noted herein, including, but not limited to, commodity price, fiscal regime\nchanges, government project approval delays, regulatory changes, credit downgrades and regional conflict. If one or more of these factors negatively impacts a project partners\u2019 cash flows or ability to obtain adequate financing, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in a reduction of the Company\u2019s reserves and production, which negatively impacts the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability.\nMurphy\u2019s Information Technology environment may be exposed to cyber threats.\nIn recent years the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. We depend on these technologies to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third-party partners, and conduct many of our activities.\nMaintaining the security of the technology and preventing unauthorized access is critical given increasing global threats from cybercrime. The Company\u2019s approach focuses on cyber risk assessment, asset protection, eradicating security vulnerabilities, security education and security awareness.\nSpecifically, where we are reliant on third parties, we add in contract provisions to protect ourselves so that the third party needs to comply with our security policies, notify us of breaches timely and jointly perform risk assessments. We incorporate network access controls (include remote access security) to prevent unauthorized devices connecting to our network. As the sophistication of cyber-attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to dedicate additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.\nPotential federal or state regulations could increase the Company\u2019s costs and/or restrict operating methods, which could adversely affect its production levels.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to numerous environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations at the international, federal, provincial, state, tribal, and local levels. These laws and associated requirements can impose operational controls and/or siting constraints on our business. These laws and regulations can result in additional capital and operating expenditures.\nThe Company\u2019s onshore North America oil and natural gas production is dependent on a technique known as hydraulic fracturing whereby water, sand and certain chemicals are injected into deep oil and natural gas bearing reservoirs in North America. This process occurs thousands of feet below the surface and creates fractures in the rock formation within the reservoir which enhances migration of oil and natural gas to the wellbore. The Company primarily uses this technique in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in Western Canada. In June 2011, the State of Texas adopted a law requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The Provinces of British Columbia and Alberta have also issued regulations related to various aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities under their jurisdictions. It is possible that the states, the U.S., Canadian provinces and certain municipalities adopt further laws or regulations which could render the process unlawful, less effective or drive up its costs. If any such action is taken in the future, the Company\u2019s production levels could be adversely affected, or its costs of drilling and completion could be increased. Once new laws and/or regulations have been enacted and adopted, the costs of compliance are appraised.\nHydraulic fracturing operations subject the Company to operational risks inherent in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas. These risks include underground migration or surface spillage due to releases of oil, natural gas, formation water or well fluids, as well as any related surface or groundwater contamination, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. Ineffective containment of surface spillage and surface or groundwater contamination resulting from hydraulic fracturing operations, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, could result in environmental pollution, remediation expenses and third-party claims alleging damages, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, hydraulic fracturing requires significant quantities of water; the wastewater from oil and natural gas operations is often disposed of through underground injection. Certain increased seismic activities have been linked to underground water injection. Any diminished access to water for use in the hydraulic fracturing process, any inability to properly dispose of wastewater, or any further restrictions placed on wastewater, could curtail the Company\u2019s operations or otherwise result in operational delays or increased costs.\nIn April 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s (DOI) Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) enacted broad regulatory changes related to Gulf of Mexico well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea containment, among other items. These changes are known broadly as the Well Control Rule, and amendments to this rule were enacted in May 2019. Compliance is required over the next several years. Some provisions remain for which BSEE future enforcement actions are unclear, so risk of impact leading to increased future cost on the Company\u2019s Gulf of Mexico operations remains.\nIn July 2016, the DOI\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued an updated Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) providing details on revised procedures BOEM used to determine a lessee\u2019s ability to carry out decommissioning obligations for activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including the Gulf of Mexico. This revised policy became effective in September 2016 and instituted new criteria by which the BOEM will evaluate the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the OCS. If the BOEM determines under the revised policy that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. In January 2017 BOEM extended the implementation timeline for the NTL by six months for properties which have co-lessees, and in February 2017 BOEM withdrew sole liability orders issued in December 2016 to allow time for the new administration to review the financial assurance program for decommissioning. Although the Company believes a potential new BOEM policy could lead to increased costs for its Gulf of Mexico operations, it does not currently believe that the impact will be material to its operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn the future, BOEM and/or BSEE may impose new and more stringent offshore operating regulations which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nMurphy\u2019s operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide political developments.\nMany governments, including those that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), unilaterally intervene at times in the market of crude oil and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as changing fiscal regimes (including corporate income tax rates), setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production.\nChanges in government fiscal policies can lead to earnings volatility. For example, in 2018, Murphy Oil\u2019s net income included a favorable income tax adjustment of $135.7 million related to the 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The $135.7 million adjustment, primarily related to the reinstatement of a deferred tax asset for 2017 net operating losses, which in 2017, was assumed utilized against the deemed repatriation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Murphy recorded a tax expense of $274.0 million directly related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. The charge includes the impact of a deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 0.1%of the Company\u2019s proved reserves, as defined by the SEC, were located in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. In addition, prices and availability of crude oil, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political factors and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect Murphy\u2019s operations and earnings include expropriation, tax changes, royalty increases, redefinition of international boundaries, preferential and discriminatory awarding of oil and natural gas leases, restrictions on drilling and/or production, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. Governments could also initiate regulations concerning matters such as currency fluctuations, currency conversion, protection and remediation of the environment, and concerns over the possibility of global warming caused by the production and use of hydrocarbon energy.\nA number of non-governmental entities routinely attempt to influence industry members and government energy policy in an effort to limit industry activities, such as hydrocarbon production, drilling and hydraulic fracturing with the desire to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which may harm air quality, and to restrict hydrocarbon spills, which may harm land and/or groundwater.\nAdditionally, because of the numerous countries in which the Company operates, certain other risks exist, including the application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Canada Corruption of Foreign Officials Act, the Brazil Clean Companies Act, the Mexico General Law of the National Anti-Corruption System, and other similar anti-corruption compliance statutes.\nIt is not possible to predict the actions of governments and hence the impact on Murphy\u2019s future operations and earnings.\nMurphy\u2019s business is subject to operational hazards, security risks and risks normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.\nThe Company operates in urban and remote, and sometimes inhospitable, areas around the world. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes (and other forms of severe weather), mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war, civil unrest, piracy and acts of terrorism could result in the loss of hydrocarbons and associated revenues, environmental pollution or contamination, personal injury, (including death), and property damages for which the Company could be deemed to be liable and which could subject the Company to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages. This risk extends to actions and operational hazards of other operators in the industry, which may also impact the Company.\nThe location of many of Murphy\u2019s key assets causes the Company to be vulnerable to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Many of the Company\u2019s offshore fields are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where hurricanes and tropical storms can lead to shutdowns and damages. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November. Moreover, it should be noted that scientists have predicted that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that increase significant weather events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our operations could be adversely affected. Although the Company maintains insurance for such risks as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K report, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured.\nMurphy\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to offset costs associated with certain events and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the future on terms that justify its purchase.\nMurphy maintains insurance against certain, but not all, hazards that could arise from its operations. The Company maintains liability insurance sufficient to cover its share of gross insured claim costs up to approximately $500 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. Generally, this insurance covers various types of third-party claims related to personal injury, death and property damage, including claims arising from \u201csudden and accidental\u201d pollution events. The Company also maintains insurance coverage with an additional limit of $400 million per occurrence ($875 million for Gulf of Mexico claims), all or part of which could apply to certain sudden and accidental pollution events. These policies have deductibles ranging from $10 million to $25 million. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nLawsuits against Murphy and its subsidiaries could adversely affect its operating results.\nThe Company or certain of its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings, including lawsuits for alleged personal injuries, property damages and other business-related matters. Certain of these claims may take many years to resolve through court and arbitration proceedings or negotiated settlements. In the opinion of management and based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the currently pending legal proceedings are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risks associated with sales of certain of its products to customers and associated with its operating partners.\nAlthough Murphy limits its credit risk by selling its products to numerous entities, it still, at times, carries credit risk from its customers. For certain oil and natural gas properties operated by the Company, other companies which own partial interests may not be able to meet their financial obligation to pay for their share of capital and operating costs as they come due. The inability of a purchaser of the Company\u2019s oil or natural gas or a partner of the Company to meet their respective payment obligations to the Company could have an adverse effect on Murphy\u2019s future earnings and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 28345, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MUR"}
