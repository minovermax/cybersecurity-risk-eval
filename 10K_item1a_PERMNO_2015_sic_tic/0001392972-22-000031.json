{"cik": "1392972", "company": "PROS Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock; these risks are categories and not listed in terms of their importance or level of risk.\nStrategic, Commercial and Operational Risks\nWe must successfully navigate the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have adversely impacted, and we expect will continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the pandemic during any period may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. For example, our 2020 subscription bookings impacted our 2021 subscription revenue, as there is a timing lag between subscription bookings and the revenue recognized on those subscription bookings. If the pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees\u2019, partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 productivity and businesses, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, including risks associated with our customers and supply chain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has put unprecedented strain on governments, healthcare systems, educational institutions, businesses and individuals around the world, the full impact and duration of which is difficult to assess or predict. The pandemic also continues to disrupt the global economy, including through disruptions in global supply chains, turmoil in labor markets and inflation caused in part by strong consumer demand where local economies reopened. The global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic may persist for an indefinite period, including in specific geographic regions or sectors of the economy, even after the pandemic has subsided. The long-term impact of the pandemic on global economic markets continues to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments, businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic and the effectiveness of those actions.\nGovernmental authorities continue to adopt a variety of restrictions in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, including travel restrictions, quarantines, physical distancing, and business limitations and shutdowns. Compliance with these measures by us and by our prospects, customers, suppliers and other counterparties has impacted our business, and this impact could last for an indefinite period of time.\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 has adversely impacted a number of our prospects and customers, who continue to experience downturns or disruption in their own businesses. For example, our travel industry customers experienced unprecedented declines in demand globally in 2020, which despite some signs of recovery of in-country travel demand in 2021, may remain below pre-pandemic levels for some time. Impacted prospects and customers have in the past and may again in the future, decrease spending on technology initiatives, stall or halt implementation projects, request concessions from existing contracts, and in some cases file for bankruptcy protection. We expect that customer bookings and the related revenue and cash flows will continue to be lower than we anticipated prior to the pandemic. If a significant number of our customers impacted by COVID-19 are unable to make their contractually obligated payments to us, file for bankruptcy protection or elect to renew their current contracts with us at lower usage levels, this would have an adverse impact on our accounts receivable, subscription revenue, business, cash flows and financial condition. In response, we have postponed and may continue to postpone or cancel, planned investments in our business, which may impact our product development and rate of innovation, either of which could seriously harm our business.\nThe impact of COVID-19 will likely continue even after the pandemic is contained. For example, airline travel demand may remain suppressed and recovery may not follow a linear path. As there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect, extent or duration of the current pandemic, or the resultant personal, economic and governmental reactions, we are unable to forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our bookings, revenue, results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, and may have to take additional actions in the future that could further harm our business and financial performance. Although we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nThe disruptions caused by COVID-19, including the limitations on meeting in-person with existing and potential customers and amongst our teams because our team is dispersed, may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our\nproduct development, sales, marketing, product implementation and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote work arrangements. Many employees may continue to have additional personal needs to attend to such as looking after children as a result of school closures or adjusted school calendars or family who become sick, and employees may continue to become sick themselves and be unable to work. Similarly, our business practice modifications in response to the pandemic could present challenges to maintaining our corporate culture, including employee engagement, development and productivity. We have reopened our offices on a voluntary basis as local regulations permit. The reopening of our offices has required and may continue to require non-trivial investments to manage additional risks and operational challenges, including in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace safety protocols. These efforts may divert management attention, and the protocols may create logistical challenges for our employees which could adversely impact employee productivity and morale. Even if we follow what we believe to be best practices, our measures may not prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Any incidents of actual or perceived transmission may expose us to liability from employee claims, adversely impact employee productivity and morale, and result in negative publicity and reputational harm.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 on our business continue to be uncertain, evolving, dynamic and dependent on numerous unpredictable factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the spread, duration and severity of COVID-19 and the mutations or variations thereof as a public health matter and its impact on governments, businesses and society generally and our clients, partners and our business;\n\u2022the duration, impact and effectiveness of measures taken by governments, businesses and society in response to COVID-19, including the availability, effectiveness and adoption of vaccines, and other legislative and regulatory measures;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, including the impact on demand for business travel as a result of increased usage of videoconferencing and other technologies;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on the financial health and operations of our current and prospective customers and partners, including the increase in business failures among our customers and other businesses; and\n\u2022the prioritization of technology investments and projects in light of other demands on customers and prospects caused by COVID-19, including secondary affects such as inflation, labor disruptions and talent shortages.\nIf we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our results of operations, financial performance and overall business will be harmed. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 to our business.\nOur IT systems are regularly under attack. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our data or our IT systems, our and our customers\u2019 operations may be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may limit or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur solutions involve the storage, and to a more limited extent, the transmission of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, including personal and other sensitive data. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to maintain security measures designed to prevent, eliminate or alleviate known security vulnerabilities, data theft, data corruption, data loss, computer viruses, ransomware or malicious software programs or code, cyber attacks, including advanced persistent threat intrusions, by third parties and similar disruptive events (each a \"Security Incident\"). Given the novel and sophisticated ways that hackers and other cyber criminals engage in cyber attacks, it is reasonable to expect that despite the implementation of security measures, our security measures and the security measures of third-party providers on which we rely would not be sufficient to prevent our systems from being compromised. If these measures are breached or are insufficient to prevent or mitigate a cyber attack, whether as a result of third-party action, employee error or misconduct, design or deployment defects, or otherwise, we could experience a Security Incident. Moreover, because the scale and number of cyber attacks continue to grow and because techniques used to compromise systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched or for an extended period of time thereafter, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative or remediation measures in a timely manner, if at all, even when a vulnerability is known. We and the third-party providers on which we rely may not be able to address such vulnerability prior to experiencing a Security Incident. Our risk is heightened given the increase in remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially beyond as remote work and resource access expand, there is an increased risk of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks, exploitation of any cybersecurity flaws that may exist, an increase in the number of\ncybersecurity threats or attacks, and other security challenges as a result of most of our employees and our service providers continuing to work remotely from non-corporate managed networks.\nSecurity Incidents could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers, as well as loss of confidence in the security of our solutions and services, damage to our reputation, negative impact to our future sales, disruption of our business, increases to our information security costs, unauthorized access to, and theft, loss or disclosure of, our and our customers\u2019 proprietary and confidential information, including personal information, litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement actions, including fines or other actions, increased stock price volatility, significant costs related to indemnity obligations, legal liability and other expenses, and material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot ensure that our commercial insurance will be available or sufficient to compensate us for all costs we may incur as a result of a Security Incident, and if we were to incur significant costs, our ability to obtain comparable insurance in the future may be impaired or only available at significantly increased cost.\nIn the normal course of our business, we experience Security Incidents. We are aware of the widely reported vulnerability in Apache's Log4j software library and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability in our systems. However, as with any vulnerability, there can be no assurance that our mitigation will fully prevent a Security Incident exploiting this vulnerability. There can be no assurance that future Security Incidents will not be material to our business operations, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nFailure to increase business from our customers and sustain our historical renewal rates and pricing could adversely affect our future revenue and operating results.\nMany of our existing customers initially purchase our software solutions for a specific business segment or geographic location within their organization, and over time we partner with them to add business segments and geographic locations within their organization. Our subscription agreements are typically for an initial term of three years, and our legacy maintenance and support agreements are typically renewed for annual terms. These customers might not choose to renew, to make additional purchases of our software solutions or to expand their existing software solutions to other business segments. In addition, as we deploy new applications and features for our software solutions or introduce new software solutions, our current customers may not purchase these new offerings. If we fail to generate additional business from our existing customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nWe may not accurately predict future customer renewal rates, which can decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, mergers and acquisitions of our customers, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets, including fluctuations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our customers choose not to renew their subscription, maintenance and support agreements with us on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls or adequately address competitive challenges.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced substantial growth in our customers, headcount and operations. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we expect to continue to expand our customer base, headcount and operations over time. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, general and administrative resources and operational infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage this growth and scale our operations, which is more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. To manage this growth, we have and will continue to need to improve our operational, financial, management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We also need to ensure that our policies and procedures evolve to reflect our current operations and are appropriately communicated to and observed by employees, and that we continue to appropriately manage our assets. Failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business performance and operating results.\nWe depend on third-party data centers, software, data and other unrelated service providers and any disruption from such third-party providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business.\nOur cloud products are dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, including Microsoft Azure, IBM Softlayer and Amazon Web Services, all of which must inter-operate for end users to achieve their computing goals. We utilize third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud platform providers, and other service providers to host and\ndeliver our subscription services as well as for our own business operations. We host our cloud products from data centers in a variety of countries, including the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Singapore and other countries. While we control and generally have exclusive access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to Security Incidents, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite our failover capabilities, standard protocols and other precautions, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain resulting in a delay, potentially lengthy, of hardware necessary to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business. These providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nCertain of our applications are essential to our customers\u2019 ability to quote, price, and/or sell their products and services. Interruption in our service may affect the availability, accuracy or timeliness of quotes, pricing or other information and could require us to issue service credits to our customers, damage our reputation, cause our customers to terminate their use of our solutions, require us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, and prevent us from gaining additional business from current or future customers. In addition, certain of our applications require access to our customer\u2019s data which may be held by third parties, some of whom are, or may become, our competitors. For example, many of our travel industry products rely upon access to airline data held by large airline IT providers which compete against certain of our airline products. Certain of these competitors have in the past, and may again in the future, make it difficult for our airline customers to access their data in a timely and/or cost-effective manner.\nAny disruption from our third-party data center, software, data or other service providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales and lead to legal liability and other costs.\nImplementation projects involve risks which can negatively impact the effectiveness of our software, resulting in harm to our reputation, business and financial performance.\nThe implementation of certain of our software solutions involve complex, large-scale projects that require substantial support operations, significant resources and reliance on factors beyond our control. For example, the success of certain of our implementation projects is dependent upon the quality of data used by our software solutions and the commitment of customers\u2019 resources and personnel to the projects. We may not be able to correct or compensate for weaknesses or problems in data, or any lack of our customers\u2019 commitment and investment in personnel and resources. Further, various factors, including our customers\u2019 business, integration, migration and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. For example, changes in customer requirements, delays, or deviations from our recommended best practices occur during implementation projects. As a result, we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation of our products. If we are unable to successfully manage the implementation of our software solutions, and as a result those products or implementations do not meet customer needs, expectations or timeline, we may become involved in disputes with our customers, may be unable to sell additional products or secure a renewal of the customer\u2019s subscription, and our business reputation and financial performance may be significantly harmed. If an implementation project for a large customer or a number of customers is substantially delayed or canceled, our ability to recognize the associated revenue and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our cloud operations, we may be subject to liabilities and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in the number of customers and data volumes serviced by our cloud infrastructure in recent years. While we have designed our cloud infrastructure to meet the current and anticipated future performance and accessibility needs of our customers, we must manage our cloud operations to handle changes in hardware and software parameters, spikes in customer usage and new versions of our software. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, system disruptions, outages and other cloud infrastructure performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks (internal or external), fraud, spikes in customer usage, denial of service issues and other Security Incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Our customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis and for certain of our products we also offer\nresponse time commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level or response time commitments, or if we suffer extended periods of unavailability for our solutions, we may be contractually obligated to issue service credits or refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, or customers may choose to terminate or not renew contracts. Any extended service outages or other performance problems could also result in damage to our reputation or our customers\u2019 businesses, cause our customers to elect not to renew or to delay or withhold payment to us, loss of future sales, lead to customers making other claims against us that could harm our subscription revenues, result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, increase collection cycles for our accounts receivable or lead to the expense and risk of litigation.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business may be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot, however, be certain that steps we take to protect our intellectual property are adequate.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. The procurement and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual considerations, and the associated legal standards are not always applied predictably or uniformly, can change, and may not provide adequate remedies. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or adequately enforce our intellectual property rights, and other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand, competitive business position, business prospects, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur use of third-party software creates dependencies outside of our control.\nWe use third-party software in our software solutions. If our relations with any of these third parties are impaired, or if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our solutions could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software.\nWe may enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, fail to achieve our strategic objectives, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe have completed five acquisitions since 2013, including our recent acquisition of EveryMundo, and we plan to continue to acquire other businesses, technologies and products that we intend to complement or enhance our existing business, solutions, services and technologies. We cannot provide assurance that the acquisitions we have made or may make in the future will provide us with the benefits or achieve the results we anticipated when entering into the transaction(s). Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies, including integrating financial reporting and operating systems, particularly with respect to foreign and/or public subsidiaries;\n\u2022disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel;\n\u2022difficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our solutions and services;\n\u2022unexpected expenses resulting from the acquisition; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nIn addition, we may incur debt, acquisition-related costs and expenses, restructuring charges and write-offs as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our operations.\nOur headquarters is located in Houston, Texas, and we conduct business in other domestic and international locations. We also rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications for our sales, marketing, development, services, operational support and hosted services. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our infrastructure, systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major hurricane, earthquake, fire, flood or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our business continuity and disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause, among other impacts, system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customer obligations or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country\u2019s or region\u2019s demand for our products. Even though we carry business interruption insurance and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses from business interruptions that exceed the coverage under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or other catastrophic event could create a negative perception in the marketplace, delay our product innovations, or lead to lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and losses of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are a multinational corporation exposed to risks inherent in international operations.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from our customers outside the U.S. To date, the majority of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars, although the majority of our expenses that we incur in our international operations are denominated in local currencies. To date, we have not used risk management techniques or \"hedged\" the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, including our revenue and operating margins, can be subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as regulatory, political, social and economic developments or instability in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional financial information about geographic areas, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, requiring resources and management attention, and may subject us to new or larger levels of regulatory, economic, foreign currency exchange, tax and political risks, which may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have customers in over 60 countries internationally, which we service through our operations in the U.S., Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and Singapore. We expect our international operations to continue to grow. In addition to navigating the challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in foreign jurisdictions, we face other risks with respect to our international operations, including:\n\u2022economic conditions in various parts of the world, particularly disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022sustained disruption to international travel from the COVID-19 pandemic and variations or mutations thereof as well as any other outbreaks of contagious diseases;\n\u2022differing labor and employment regulations, especially where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022the difficulty of managing and staffing our international operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in laws governing the geolocation or flow of data across international borders;\n\u2022less favorable intellectual property laws;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust and industry-specific laws and regulations and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;\n\u2022vetting and monitoring our third-party business partners in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing tax laws and regulations that may affect both our international and domestic tax liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs;\n\u2022availability of sufficient network connectivity required for certain of our products;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, especially in developing countries; and\n\u2022tariffs and trade barriers, data sovereignty, import and export controls and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our solutions in certain foreign markets.\nIf we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMarket and Competition Risks\nAny downturn in sales to our target markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to sell our software solutions to customers in our target industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. If we are unable to sell our software solutions effectively to customers in these industries, we may not be able to grow our business. For example, COVID-19 has had a dramatic adverse impact on the travel industry and the timing and pace of recovery is unpredictable as further described above.\nWe have historically been subject to lengthy sales cycles, and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and cause our revenue, operating income, and cash flows to decline in the future.\nOur sales cycles may take a month to over a year for large enterprise customers. A large enterprise customer\u2019s decision to use our solutions typically involves a number of internal approvals, and sales to those prospective customers generally require us to provide greater levels of education about the benefits and features of our solutions. We expend substantial resources during our sales cycles with no assurance that a sale may ultimately result. The length of each individual sales cycle depends on many factors, a number of which we cannot control, including the prospective customer's internal evaluation and approval process requirements, as well as the prospective customer's budget and/or resource constraints. In addition, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many local governments as well as enterprises have limited travel and in-person meetings and implemented other restrictions making the sales process more lengthy and difficult, particularly for new customers. Any unexpected lengthening of the sales cycle or failure to secure anticipated orders could negatively affect our revenue. Any significant failure to generate sales after incurring costs related to our sales process could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire new functionality and software solutions, we may not be able to grow our business and it could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our existing software solutions or new solutions that achieve market acceptance or to integrate technology, products and services that we acquire into our platform, our business,\nrevenues and other operating results could be significantly adversely affected. The success of enhancements, new features and modules depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancements or new features or modules. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the planned release dates of enhancements to our platform, and we have discovered, and may in the future discover, errors in new releases after their introduction. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our platform, or customer claims, including, among other things, warranty claims against us, any of which could cause us to lose existing customers or affect our ability to attract new customers. Furthermore, because our software solutions are intended to interoperate with a variety of third-party enterprise software solutions, we must continue to modify and enhance our software to keep pace with changes in such solutions. Any inability of our software to operate effectively with third-party software necessary to provide effective solutions to our customers, could reduce the demand for our software solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and limit our financial performance.\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe markets for enterprise software applications for CPQ, pricing optimization and management, airline revenue optimization, airline distribution and retail, and digital offer marketing are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. We expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the markets in which we compete continue to develop and expand, as well as through industry consolidation, including through a merger or partnership of two or more of our competitors or the acquisition of a competitor by a larger company. Some of our current and potential competitors may have larger installed bases of users, longer operating histories, broader distribution, greater name recognition, and have significantly greater resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nCompetition could seriously impede our ability to sell our software solutions and services on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future solutions obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive. In addition, if these competitors develop solutions with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, or if they offer solutions with similar functionality at substantially lower prices than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. In addition, our competitors have and may in the future, offer their products and services at a lower price, or, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, offer price concessions, delay payment terms, or provide financing or other terms and conditions that are more enticing to potential customers. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins could be reduced and our operating results could be adversely affected. If we do not compete successfully against current or future competitors, competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.\nWe focus primarily on CPQ, pricing optimization and management, airline revenue optimization, airline distribution and retail, and digital offer marketing software and if the markets for these software solutions develop more slowly than we expect or if we fail to capitalize on the market opportunity, our business could be harmed.\nWe derive most of our revenue from providing our software solutions for CPQ, pricing optimization and management, airline revenue optimization, airline distribution and retail, and digital offer marketing, as well as providing implementation services and ongoing customer support. These markets are evolving rapidly, and it is uncertain whether software for these markets will achieve and sustain high levels of demand. Our success depends on the willingness of businesses in our target markets to use the types of solutions we offer and our ability to capture share in these markets. Some businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to implement such software for a number of reasons, including failure to understand the potential returns of improving their processes, lack of knowledge about the potential benefits that such software may provide, or reluctance to change existing internal processes. Some businesses may elect to improve their sales and pricing processes through solutions obtained from their existing enterprise software providers, whose solutions are designed principally to address functional areas other than what our solutions provide. If businesses do not embrace the benefits of vendor software solutions in the areas in which we focus, then these markets may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly and adversely affect our revenue, operating results, and cash flows.\nHuman Capital Risks\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success has been our corporate culture, and we invest substantial time and resources in building and maintaining our culture and developing our personnel; however, as we continue to scale our business both organically and through potential acquisitions, it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture. Moreover, our shift to a hybrid work environment requires significant action to preserve culture with many employees primarily working remotely and facing unique personal and professional challenges. While we have implemented many wellness, development and supportive programs for our workforce, the dramatic shift to a hybrid work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented risks to our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic objectives.\nIf we lose key members of our management team or sales, development or operations personnel, or are unable to attract and retain employees. our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon the performance and service of our executive officers and other key personnel. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team and to other key employee roles resulting from organizational changes or the hiring or departure of executives or other employees, which could have a serious adverse effect on our business and operating results. For example, our Chief Technology Officer stepped down from his role in late 2021 as part of his planned retirement from the Company, and we recently announced the elimination of the Chief Operating Officer role. If key personnel become ill due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to manage our business effectively and, as a result, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to timely identify, attract and retain highly qualified personnel, including data scientists, software developers and implementation personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for technical talent in certain markets, and is exacerbated by COVID-19's impact on labor market conditions. We compete for talent with other companies that have greater resources, in large part, based on our culture and overall employee experience. With the wide market acceptance of and increase in remote work, we have experienced increased direct competition for talent, often from larger companies taking advantage of lower cost talent markets. Employee turnover creates a variety of risks including time, costs and resources required to recruit and train new employees to learn our business. The flexibility of our hybrid work approach provides us with access to greater talent pools and contributes to our hiring and retaining competitiveness but also brings costs and risks, including employment, tax, insurance and compliance risks. If we are unable to attract and retain our key employees, we may not be able to achieve our objectives, and our business could be harmed.\nFailure to adequately expand and train our direct and indirect sales force may impede our growth.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenue has been attributable to the efforts of our direct sales force. We believe that our future growth will depend, to a significant extent, on the continued development of our direct sales force, and our sales team's ability to manage and retain our existing customer base, expand our sales to existing customers and obtain new customers. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel. Due to a variety of factors, including performance management, attrition, competition for talent and the impact of COVID-19, we experienced significant turnover in 2021 to our direct sales force. New sales hires require significant training and often take a number of months before becoming fully productive, if at all. If we are unable to develop or retain sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, our growth may be impeded.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we have developed, and expect to expand, our indirect sales force via channel partners, such as management consulting firms, systems integrators and other resellers, to market, sell and/or implement our solutions. We anticipate that channel partners will become an increasingly important driver of our sales growth. We expect to invest significant resources to identify, establish, train and retain successful strategic partner relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain our partner relationships, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our sales growth rates may be limited.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks\nIncreasing regulatory focus on data privacy, cyber security and data localization issues and expanding laws impact our business and expose us to increased liability.\nPersonal privacy, data localization and data security continue to be significant issues in the United States, Europe and many other jurisdictions. We provide our cloud software solutions globally, including in countries that have, or may adopt in the future, stringent data privacy, cyber security or data localization laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may be\ninconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys continue to increasingly scrutinize how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting our business. International laws such as the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), as well as emerging and evolving state laws in the United States, such as the California Consumer Protection Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and the Colorado Privacy Act, could create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. Although we have implemented measures designed to comply with applicable requirements, the dynamic nature of these laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation by regulators and courts, may affect our ability to implement our business models effectively. In addition, our ongoing efforts to comply with these laws and regulations entail substantial expenses and may divert resources from other initiatives. Changes in these laws and regulations have in the past increased, and may continue to increase, the cost of providing our products and services, could limit us from offering certain solutions in certain jurisdictions, could adversely affect our sales cycles, and could impact our new technology innovation. In addition, our cloud software solutions store data on behalf of our customers, and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws and regulations, such non-compliance could result in litigation or reputational harm to us. Any perceived inability to adequately address privacy, data localization or cyber security compliance or to comply with more complex and numerous laws and regulations, even if unfounded, could result in liability to us and indemnification obligations, damage our reputation, inhibit sales of our solutions or harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and receive personal data. The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks that previously allowed U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland have been invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\"). While we have historically relied on Standard Contractual Clauses (\"SCCs\") for such transfers and the CJEU has upheld SCCs as a valid transfer mechanism, provided those SCCs meet certain requirements, the CJEU rulings make clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional and ongoing scrutiny. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission published new SCCs for this purpose, and we are adapting our existing contractual arrangements to meet these new requirements. The validity of data transfer mechanisms in both Europe and the U.S. remain subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. Recent recommendations from the European Data Protection Board, decisions from supervisory authorities, recent proposals for reform of the data transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data outside the United Kingdom, and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms, which, together with increased enforcement action from supervisory authorities in relation to cross-border transfers of personal data, could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. If other jurisdictions implement restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers (or do not permit data to leave the country of origin), such developments could adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations in those jurisdictions.\nAny unauthorized, and potentially improper, actions of our personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe recognition of our revenue depends on, among other things, the terms negotiated in our contracts with our customers. Our personnel may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, but there can be no assurance that such policies will be followed. For instance, in the event that our sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing revenue in accordance with our plans. Furthermore, depending on when we learn of unauthorized actions and the size of the transactions involved, we may have to restate revenue for a previously reported period, which could seriously harm our business, operating results, cash flows, financial condition and reputation with current and potential customers and investors.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims may cause us to incur significant expense or prevent us from selling our software solutions.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. A third-party may assert that our technology violates its intellectual property rights, or we may become the subject of a material intellectual property dispute. Selling improvement (including CPQ), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including revenue management) and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail, and digital offer marketing) solutions may become increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of such commercially available solutions increases and the functionality of these solutions overlaps. In addition, changes in patent laws in the U.S. may affect the scope, strength and\nenforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. Future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own potential patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of others, responding to such claims may require us to:\n\u2022incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts to defend such claims;\n\u2022pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed such parties\u2019 patents or copyrights;\n\u2022cease making, selling or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022distract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us;\n\u2022enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions.\nAny licenses required as a result of litigation under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively develop or market our solutions, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or maintain profitability.\nOur contract terms generally obligate us to indemnify and hold our customers harmless from certain costs arising from third-party claims brought against our customers alleging that the use of our solutions infringe intellectual property rights of others. If we are unable to resolve our legal obligations by settling or paying an infringement claim, we may be required to compensate our customers.\nOur use of open source software may subject our software solutions to general release or re-engineering.\nWe use open source software in our solutions. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. In addition, open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nDefects or errors in our software solutions could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our solutions and result in significant costs to us.\nOur software solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors. Several of our solutions have recently been developed and may therefore be more likely to contain undetected defects or errors. In addition, we frequently develop enhancements to our software solutions that may contain defects. We have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date. We have in the past issued, and may in the future need to issue, corrective releases of our solutions to correct defects or errors. The occurrence of any defects or errors could result in:\n\u2022delayed market acceptance and lost sales of our software solutions;\n\u2022delays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022diversion of our resources;\n\u2022legal claims, including product liability claims, against us;\n\u2022increased maintenance and support expenses; and\n\u2022increased insurance costs.\nOur agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our liability for defects and errors in our software solutions and damages relating to such defects and errors, but these provisions may not be enforced by a court or otherwise effectively protect us from legal claims. Our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all of the costs resulting from these legal claims. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that our current liability insurance coverage would continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the insurer may deny coverage on any future claims. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, even if we prevail in any litigation, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations.\nBusiness Model and Capital Structure Risks\nWe have experienced losses since we transitioned to a cloud strategy in 2015, the COVID-19 pandemic has extended our timeline to profitability, and we may continue to incur losses for longer than we expect.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to exceed our revenues in the near term as we continue to make investments as part of our cloud strategy, particularly in new product development, sales, marketing, security, privacy and cloud operations. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 on our business contributed to our losses over the past two years and extended our timeline of achieving profitability. Our ability to return to profitability depends on our ability to: continue to drive subscription sales, enhance our existing products and develop new products, scale our sales and marketing and product development organizations, successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies, renew our subscription agreements with existing customers, and manage our expenses. If we are not able to execute on these actions, our business may not grow as we anticipate, our operating results could be adversely affected and we may continue to incur net losses in the future. Additionally, our new initiatives may not generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to recoup our investments in them. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe incurred indebtedness by issuing convertible notes, and our debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows in the future.\nIn September 2020, we issued $150.0 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes (\"2027 Notes\") due September 15, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2021, the entire $150.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes are outstanding.\nIn May 2019, we issued $143.8 million principal amount of 1.0% convertible senior notes (\"2024 Notes\" and together with the 2027 Notes, the \"Notes\") due May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2021, the entire $143.8 million of aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes are outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences because it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes. Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We cannot control many of these factors. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to comply with any covenants contained in the agreements governing any of our debt, or make a payment on any of our debt when due, we could be in default on such debt, which could, in turn, result in such debt and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, and/or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that\nany such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nOur quarterly results may vary and may not fully reflect the performance of our business.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any quarter may not be reflected in our revenue for that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, our failure to achieve our internal sales targets, a decline in the market demand of our services or decreases in our retention rate may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. For example, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from additional sales must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. We may be unable to timely adjust our cost structure to reflect changes in revenues. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenues are recognized over the term of the customer agreement. As a result, increased sales growth could result in our recognition of more costs than revenues in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. In addition, we expect to continue to experience some seasonal variations in our cash flows from operating activities, including, as a result of the timing of payment of payroll taxes, performance bonuses to our employees and costs associated with annual company-wide events, each of which have historically been highest in our first fiscal quarter. Therefore, the results of any prior quarterly periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.\nIf we fail to migrate customers with on-premises software licenses to our latest cloud software solutions, our future revenue may be limited and our costs to provide support to those customers may increase.\nCustomers with on-premises licenses for our legacy software need to migrate to our current cloud solutions to take advantage of our latest features, functionality and security which are only available via the PROS cloud. When considering whether to migrate, these customers may evaluate alternative solutions due to the additional change management and implementation costs associated with migrating to cloud-based applications. When on-premises software customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, our internal development and customer support teams find it increasingly difficult and costly to support a declining number of on-premises customers. In addition, if our legacy on-premises license customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, choose alternative solutions or otherwise choose to not continue doing business with us by, for example, canceling maintenance, our future revenue will be affected.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nRisks relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock, and the software industry generally, has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Volatility could make it difficult to trade shares of our common stock at predictable prices or times. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile, including the following:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022decreases in market valuations of comparable companies;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022decreases in financial estimates by equity research analysts;\n\u2022announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations and standards affecting the software industry and our software solutions;\n\u2022conversion of convertible notes into equity or sales of common stock or other securities by us in the future;\n\u2022damages, settlements, legal fees and other costs related to litigation, claims and other contingencies;\n\u2022U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u2022other risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our operations. All of these factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur directors, executive officers, and certain significant stockholders hold a significant portion of our outstanding shares.\nAt December 31, 2021, our directors and executive officers collectively control approximately 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, and together with certain significant stockholders, including investment funds associated with Brown Capital Management, LLC, Vanguard Group Inc., BlackRock, Inc., Conestoga Capital Advisors, LLC, Fred Alger Management, LLC and RGM Capital, LLC, control approximately 63% of our issued and outstanding common shares. In the event that these stockholders each independently decided to vote for or against matters requiring stockholder approval, they could influence such matters in ways that may not align with your specific interests as a stockholder, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could affect the market price of our shares if there is a sale by this group of stockholders, and could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if such change of control could be beneficial to you as a stockholder.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer were\nconsidered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital, repayment of debt and for other general corporate purposes. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.", "PERMNO": 92143, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRO"}
