An investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves risks. The factors below, among others, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital position, or cause the Company\u2019s results to differ materially from its historical results or the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and, depending on future developments, may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread government response and the impact on consumers and businesses have caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets and have had and will likely continue to have a significant impact on consumers and businesses in our market area and the operations and financial performance of the Company. Governments, businesses and the public have taken unprecedented actions to try and contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, state of emergency declarations, travel bans, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus and legislative initiatives to deliver monetary aid and other relief. Many of these actions have adversely impacted the economy and forced temporary closures of nonessential business, and as a result, the businesses of many of our customers have been adversely impacted, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many state and local governments began implementing phased regulations and guidelines for reopening communities and economies, often with reduced capacity and social distancing restrictions. However, recently, many state and local governments have implemented additional restrictions in light of the significant COVID-19 resurgence.\nAlthough the scope, duration and full effects of the pandemic are evolving and cannot be fully known at this time, consequences of the pandemic and efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s effects have included and may include further market volatility, lower interest rates, disrupted trade and supply chains, increased unemployment and reduced economic activity. The period of recovery from the negative economic effects of the pandemic cannot be predicted and may be protracted. If these effects continue for a prolonged period of time, the Company may experience significant delinquencies and credit losses due to the inability of borrowers to make timely payments on loans, net interest margin compression, lower demand for our products and services, decreased capital, which may affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate new loans, disruption of operational processes arising from practices of social distancing and telecommuting and potential impairment of assets, including securities available for sale and goodwill. Credit deterioration in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio due to the pandemic may be masked or obscured by loan payment deferral programs or government stimulus or relief efforts, such as the PPP. The COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate many of the risk factors identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including risk related to our credit quality, collateral, capital, liquidity, operations, interest rate risk, strategic risk and technology.\nAlthough banks have generally been permitted to continue operating during the COVID-19 outbreak, the outbreak has caused the Company to change its business operations, including updating branch operations to comply with governmental recommendations and increasing work from home options for our employees. These changes may have adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business due to reduced effectiveness of operations, unavailability of personnel, increased cybersecurity risks related to use of remote technology, and increased costs related to these operational changes. Additionally, our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness. The changes in business operations could also have a detrimental effect on the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers and could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nUnfavorable economic conditions and elevated unemployment due to the pandemic may make it difficult for the Company to maintain deposit levels and loan origination volume. Such unfavorable conditions may cause the value of our investment portfolio and of the collateral securing the Company\u2019s loans to decline. The Federal Reserve has lowered the federal funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in part as a result of the pandemic. A prolonged period of very low interest rates could reduce the Company\u2019s net income and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertainty regarding new variants of COVID-19 that have emerged and the actions required to contain and mitigate it, the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine distribution efforts, the effects of the pandemic on our customers and vendors, the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal governments, the timing and availability of government support for the economy and financial markets including indirect governmental support for various financial assets including mortgage loans, the short- and long-term health impacts of the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, if at all. If the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, additional actions may be taken by federal, state, and local governments to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, including additional shelter-in-place orders. There can be no assurance that any efforts by the Company to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future, or as a result of changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees. Furthermore, the financial condition of our customers and vendors may be adversely impacted, which may result in an elevated level of loan losses, a decrease in demand for our products and services, or reduced availability of services provided by third parties on which we rely. Any of these events may, in turn, have a material adverse impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndex\nRisk Factors Related to our Lending Activities and Economic Conditions\nU.S. and international economic conditions and credit markets pose challenges for the Company and could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In recent years, economic growth and business activity in the Company\u2019s local markets as well as in the broader national and international economies, has been modest. In addition, domestic and foreign policies and the level of U.S. debt may present challenges to businesses and have a destabilizing effect on financial markets. Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions generally could cause a decline in the value of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio, and could increase the regulatory scrutiny of financial institutions. Another deterioration of local economic conditions could again lead to declines in real estate values and home sales and increases in the financial stress on borrowers and unemployment rates, all of which could lead to increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral value. Such a deterioration of local economic conditions could cause the level of loan losses to exceed the level the Company has provided in its allowance for loan losses which, in turn, would reduce the Company\u2019s earnings.\nGlobal credit market conditions could return to being disrupted and volatile. Although the Company remains well capitalized and has not suffered any liquidity issues, the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets. Any future turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economy may adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and profitability.\nWeaknesses in the commercial real estate markets could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance due to the Company\u2019s concentration in commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $383.4 million, or 45.8%, of total loans concentrated in commercial real estate, which includes, for purposes of this concentration, all construction loans, loans secured by multifamily residential properties, loans secured by farmland and loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties. Commercial real estate loans expose the Company to a greater risk of loss than residential real estate and consumer loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate and consumer loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial real estate loan or credit relationship exposes the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential real estate loan. Commercial real estate loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business if the properties are owner occupied. If the properties are non-owner occupied, the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flow from rent receipts. Repayment of commercial real estate loans may, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy. Weak economic or market conditions may impair a borrower\u2019s business operations, slow the execution of new leases and lead to turnover in existing leases. The combination of these factors could result in deterioration in value of some of the Company\u2019s loans. The deterioration of one or more of the Company\u2019s significant commercial real estate loans could cause a significant increase in nonaccrual loans. An increase in nonaccrual loans could result in a loss of interest income from those loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions and changes in the federal government\u2019s military or defense spending may negatively affect the local economy. The Company\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Company operates. Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Hampton Roads MSA. The local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control could impact these local economic conditions.\nIn addition, Hampton Roads is home to one of the largest military installations in the world and one of the largest concentrations of Department of Defense personnel in the United States. Some of the Company\u2019s customers may be particularly sensitive to the level of federal government spending on the military or on defense-related products. Federal spending is affected by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, presidential administration priorities, and the ability of the federal government to enact relevant appropriations bills and other legislation. Any of these factors could result in future cuts to military or defense spending or increased uncertainty about federal spending, which could have a severe negative impact on individuals and businesses in the Company\u2019s primary service area. Any related increase in unemployment rates or reduction in business development activities in the Company\u2019s primary service area could lead to reductions in loan demand, increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral value, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nIndex\nLoans that the Bank has made through federal programs are dependent on the federal government\u2019s continuation and support of these programs and on the Bank\u2019s compliance with program requirements. The Bank participates in various U.S. government agency loan guarantee programs, including programs operated by the SBA. If the Bank fails to follow any applicable regulations, guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, any loans the Bank originates as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee, exposing the Bank to credit risk it would not otherwise be exposed to or have underwritten, or result in the Bank\u2019s inability to continue originating loans under such programs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal and state governments have enacted laws and implemented programs intending to stimulate the economy in light of the business and market disruptions related to COVID-19, including the PPP. The Bank participated as a lender in both rounds of the PPP. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the SBA and the Bank believes that the majority of these loans will be forgiven. However, there can be no assurance that the borrowers will use or have used the funds appropriately or will have satisfied the staffing or payment requirements to qualify for forgiveness in whole or in part. Any portion of the loan that is not forgiven must be repaid by the borrower. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the laws, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the Bank has already been paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from the Bank of any loss related to the deficiency. Several large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. The Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans and the Bank\u2019s PPP processes. If any such litigation is filed against the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Bank\u2019s reputation. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondents or other third parties. The Company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, employment and income documentation, property appraisals, title information, and equipment pricing and valuation, in deciding which loans to originate, as well as in establishing the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which the Company relies during the loan approval process is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, the Company may fund a loan that it would not have otherwise funded or the Company may fund a loan on terms that it would not have otherwise extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or by another third party, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. In addition, a loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and it may be difficult to recover any monetary loss the Company may suffer.\nDeclines in loans outstanding could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Growing and diversifying the loan portfolio is part of the Company\u2019s strategic initiative. If quality loan demand does not continue to increase and the Company\u2019s loan portfolio begins to decline, the Company expects that excess liquidity will be invested in marketable securities. Because loans typically yield higher returns than the Company\u2019s securities portfolio, a shift towards investments in the Company\u2019s asset mix would likely result in an overall reduction in net interest income and the net interest margin. The principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income, and as discussed above, the Company\u2019s net interest margin is a major determinant of the Company\u2019s profitability. The effects of a reduction in net interest income and the net interest margin may be exacerbated by the intense competition for quality loans in the Company\u2019s primary service area and by rate reductions on loans currently held in the portfolio. As a result, a reduction in loans could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe small-to-medium size businesses the Company targets may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which could materially harm operating results. The Company targets individual and small-to-medium size business customers. Small-to-medium size businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand and compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to-medium size business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact businesses in the Company\u2019s primary service area could have a proportionately greater impact on small-to-medium-size businesses and accordingly could cause the Company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nIndex\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. A significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases. There is no precise method to predict loan losses. Like all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses (ALL) to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Accounting measurements related to impairment and the allowance for loan losses require significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect, and have in recent years materially and adversely affected, the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolutions, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Also included in management\u2019s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which are uncertain. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control and these future losses may exceed current estimates. If management\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect or if the Company experiences significant loan losses in future periods, the current level of the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses and adjustments may be necessary. In addition, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Company\u2019s loans and allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. While management believes that the Company\u2019s allowance is adequate to cover current losses, the Company cannot assure investors that it will not need to increase the allowance or that regulators will not require the allowance to be increased. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect earnings and profitability.\nAdditionally, the measure of the Company\u2019s ALL is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d Under this ASU, the current incurred loss credit impairment methodology will be replaced with the CECL model, a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Accordingly, the implementation of the CECL model will change the Company\u2019s current method of providing ALL and may result in material changes in the Company\u2019s accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The CECL model may create more volatility in the Company\u2019s level of ALL. If the Company is required to materially increase its level of ALL for any reason, such increase could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. At the FASB\u2019s October 16, 2019 meeting, the FASB Board affirmed its decision to amend the effective date of this ASU for many companies. Public business entities that are SEC filers, excluding those meeting the smaller reporting company definition, will retain the initial required implementation date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities will be required to apply the guidance for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2022. See Note 1 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding the Company\u2019s implementation of CECL.\nRisk Factors Related to our Industry\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance. The Company\u2019s profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates received on loans and investments and the rates paid for deposits and other sources of funds. The net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of the Company\u2019s control, including competition; federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies; and economic conditions. Because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest margin and, in turn, its profitability.\nThe Company generally seeks to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that it may reasonably maintain its net interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production, deposit flows, and competitive pressures are constantly changing and influence the ability to maintain a neutral position. Generally, the Company\u2019s earnings will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates depending upon the variance in volume of assets and liabilities that mature and re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of changes in interest rates, shape and slope of the yield curve, and whether the Company is more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, the Company may not be successful in maintaining a neutral position and, as a result, the Company\u2019s net interest margin may be affected. For additional details, See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Interest Sensitivity\u201d in Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K.\nIndex\nIn addition, any substantial and prolonged increase in market interest rates could reduce the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 desire to borrow money or adversely affect their ability to repay their outstanding loans by increasing their credit costs. Interest rate changes could also affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest margin, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect them. The Company is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of operations, including those referenced above. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to protect depositors and customers rather than to benefit stockholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters including, without limitation, ownership and control of the Company\u2019s shares, acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities that the Company and its subsidiaries may engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of operations. These regulations could limit the Company\u2019s growth by restricting certain of its activities. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company are subject to regular modification and change. Regulatory changes could subject the Company to more demanding regulatory compliance requirements which could affect the Company in unpredictable and adverse ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Legislation and regulatory initiatives containing wide-ranging proposals for altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationship of financial institutions are introduced regularly. The Company cannot predict in what form or whether a proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which such adoption may affect its business.\nMarket risk affects the earnings of Trust. The fee structure of Trust is generally based upon the market value of accounts under administration. Most of these accounts are invested in equities of publicly traded companies and debt obligations of both government agencies and publicly traded companies. As such, fluctuations in the equity and debt markets in general have had a direct impact upon the earnings of Trust.\nCompliance with the CFPB regulations aimed at the mortgage banking industry may require substantial changes to mortgage lending systems and processes that may adversely affect income from the Company\u2019s residential mortgage activities. The CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential real estate loan. Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require mortgage lenders either to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d In June 2015, the CFPB issued rules that combined disclosures previously established by the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act into a single disclosure referred to as the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID. TRID applies to most closed-end mortgage loans and overhauls the manner in which mortgage loan origination disclosures are made.\nThe Company does originate first mortgage loans. TRID also applies to second mortgages originated by the Company (but not to equity lines of credit). In recent years, the Company has made significant changes to its residential real estate business, including investments in technology and employee training. These CFPB rules, in addition to other previously-issued and to-be-issued CFPB regulations, could materially affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate and sell residential real estate loans or limit the terms on which the Company may offer products, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require higher levels of capital and liquidity, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income and return on equity. The capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines under the Basel III Capital Rules began to be phased in beginning in 2015. The Basel III Capital Rules, fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, require bank holding companies and banks to maintain substantially more capital as a result of higher minimum capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk-weightings and calculations. . The Basel III Capital Rules apply to the Bank but, because the Company expects to qualify under the Federal Reserve\u2019s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is not subject to the Basel III Capital Rules. The changes to the standardized calculations of risk-weighted assets are complex and may create additional compliance burdens for the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to substantially change the manner in which they collect and report information to calculate risk-weighted assets, and may increase dramatically risk-weighted assets as a result of applying higher risk weightings to many types of loans and securities. As a result, the Bank may be forced to limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans, thereby reducing the amount of credit available to borrowers and limiting opportunities to earn interest income from the loan portfolio, which may have a detrimental impact on the Company\u2019s net income.\nIndex\nIf the Company were to require additional capital, including to fund additional capital contributions to the Bank, as a result of the Basel III Capital Rules, it could be required to access the capital markets on short notice and in relatively weak economic conditions, which could result in raising capital that significantly dilutes existing stockholders. Additionally, the Company may be forced to limit banking operations and activities, and growth of loan portfolios and interest income, to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. Higher capital levels may also lower the Company\u2019s return on equity.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy. As a bank holding company, the Company\u2019s business is affected by the monetary policies established by the FRB, which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. In setting its policy, the FRB may utilize techniques such as the following:\n\u2022\nEngaging in open market transactions in U.S. Government securities;\n\u2022\nSetting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and\n\u2022\nDetermining reserve requirements.\nThese techniques determine, to a significant extent, the Company\u2019s cost of funds for lending and investing. These techniques, all of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, may have an adverse effect on deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nDeposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect future financial performance. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a certain level. Economic conditions from 2008 to 2011 increased the rate of bank failures and expectations for further bank failures, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF. Although the DIF has since been replenished, a similar economic downturn in the future could require measures similar to those implemented during the last financial crisis, such as special assessments or required prepayments of insurance premiums. If the FDIC takes action to replenish the DIF, or if the Bank\u2019s asset size increases, the Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums could increase, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to our Operations and Technology\nSystem failures, interruptions, breaches of security, or the failure of a third-party provider to perform its obligations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business operations and financial condition. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of the Company\u2019s businesses, as such systems are used to manage customer relationships, general ledger, deposits and loans. While the Company has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches, the Company\u2019s information, security, and other systems may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, and cyber-attacks. Information security risks have increased in recent years and hackers, activists and other external parties have become more technically sophisticated and well-resourced. These parties use a variety of methods to attempt to breach security systems and access the data of financial services institutions and their customers. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. In addition, any compromise of the security systems could deter customers from using the Bank\u2019s website and online banking service, both of which involve the transmission of confidential information. The security and authentication precautions imposed by the Company and the Bank may not protect the systems from compromises or breaches of security, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain data processing to certain third-party providers. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that these third-party providers will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service agreements. If the third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the Company\u2019s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Company\u2019s business operations could be adversely impacted. Further, a breach of a third-party provider\u2019s technology may cause loss to the Company\u2019s customers. Replacing these third-party providers could also create significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security, or the failure of a third-party provider to perform its obligations, could expose the Company to risks of data loss or data misuse, could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny or could expose it to civil litigation, possible financial liability and costly response measures. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, and its and their employees and customers, have recently been and may in the future be the target of criminal cyberattacks; and we could be exposed to liability and remedial costs, and our reputation and business could suffer. Like many major financial institutions, we are, from time to time, a target of criminal cyber-attacks, phishing schemes and similar fraudulent activity and cyber incidents, and we expect these threats to continue. As the numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks and schemes, utilized by cybercriminals in attempts to obtain unauthorized access to our systems or our customers\u2019 accounts have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may - like many other major financial institutions - not anticipate, safeguard against, or respond to, these acts adequately. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we - like many other major financial institutions - may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nIndex\nThough it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific cyber incident or cyber-attack, any failure to maintain the security of, or any actual or perceived loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of, customer or account information likely may lead to our customers losing trust and confidence in us. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect deposits and loans and otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that a cyber incident and any material fraudulent activity, cyber-attacks, breaches of our information security or successful penetration or circumvention of our system security may cause us significant negative consequences, including loss of Bank customers and financial assets and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, or misappropriation of our and/or our customers\u2019 confidential information, and may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny or may result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, devotion of substantial management time, increased costs to maintain insurance coverage (including increased deposit insurance premiums), or additional compliance costs, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations could have a material impact on the Company. Bank regulatory agencies routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs as required by these obligations to combat terrorist financing, elder abuse, human trafficking, anti-money laundering and other suspicious activity and to fully comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Company. Such a failure could cause a bank regulatory agency not to approve a merger or acquisition transaction or to prohibit such a transaction even if formal approval is not required. In addition, such a failure could result in a regulatory authority imposing a formal enforcement action or civil money penalty for regulatory violations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models. Processes\nthat management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company\u2019s earnings performance and liquidity, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.\nIf the models that management uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures and may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity. If the models that management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in management\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm its business. The banking business in Virginia, and in the Company\u2019s primary service area in the Hampton Roads MSA, is highly competitive and dominated by a relatively small number of large banks. Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the Virginia community banking industry. The Company\u2019s success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of and customer relationships developed by management and personnel. In particular, the Company\u2019s success is highly dependent upon the capabilities of its senior executive management. The Company believes that its management team, comprised of individuals who have worked in the banking industry for many years, is integral to implementing the Company\u2019s business plan. The Company has not entered into employment agreements with any of its executive management employees, and the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry. The Company faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. Growth and success depends on the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment. Many competitors offer products and services that are not offered by the Company, and many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively and may have larger lending limits that would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers. In addition, financial technology start-ups are emerging in key areas of banking. Some of the financial services organizations with which the Company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured national banks, and may have broader geographic services areas and lower cost structures. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over the Company in accessing funding and in providing various services. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Failure to compete effectively to attract new and retain current customers in the Company\u2019s markets could cause it to lose market share, slow its growth rate and may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nThe Company may not be able to compete effectively without the appropriate use of current technology. The use of technology in the financial services market, including the banking industry, evolves frequently. The Company may be unable to attract and maintain banking relationships with certain customers if it does not offer appropriate technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products or services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively may be impaired, which could lead to a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s substantial dependence on dividends from its subsidiaries may prevent it from paying dividends to its stockholders and adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. The Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations or revenues of its own. The Company substantially depends on dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders and to pay its operating expenses. The availability of dividends from the subsidiaries is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Company and other factors, that the Comptroller could assert that payment of dividends by the subsidiaries is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, service debt or pay operating expenses. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the subsidiaries could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and limit stockholders\u2019 return, if any, to capital appreciation.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers own a significant portion of the Company\u2019s common stock and can exert significant influence over its business and corporate affairs. The Company\u2019s directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially owned 17.37% of the Company\u2019s common stock as of June 30, 2020. Consequently, if they vote their shares in concert, they can significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. The interests of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers may conflict with the interests of other holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers may take actions affecting the Company with which other holders of the Company\u2019s common stock disagree.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock by stockholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause the common stock price to decline. Although the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ stock market, the trading volume in the common stock may be lower than that of other larger financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the potential for lower relative trading volume in the common stock, significant sales of the common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of these sales or perceptions.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive to stockholders. Any decision the Company makes to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, and the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances of common stock. Accordingly, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock bear the risk that future issuances of securities will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to operational risk, which could adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operation. The Company and its subsidiaries, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, including the risk of loss resulting from human error, fraud or unauthorized transactions due to inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events that are wholly or partially beyond the Company\u2019s control (including, for example, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, and cyber-attacks). Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. The Company and its subsidiaries have established a system of internal controls to address these risks, but there are inherent limitations to such risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that are not anticipated, identified or monitored. Any losses resulting from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, litigation costs, harm to reputation or forgone opportunities, loss of customer business, or the unauthorized release, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary information, any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation. Reputation risk, or the risk to the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation from negative public opinion, is inherent in the financial services industry. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending or foreclosure practices, regulatory compliance, corporate governance and sharing or inadequately protecting customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to keep and attract customers and employees, could expose it to litigation and regulatory action, and could adversely affect its access to the capital markets. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation could adversely affect deposits and loans and otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Company\u2019s cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s discount window. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of the Company\u2019s control, and the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit the Company\u2019s access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of the parent company or the Bank\u2019s ratings, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics or endemics, climate change and other external events could significantly impact our business. Natural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or endemics and other adverse external events could have a significant adverse impact on the business operations of the Company, third parties who perform operational services for the Company or its customers and the Company\u2019s borrowers and customers. Such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88183, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OPOF"}
