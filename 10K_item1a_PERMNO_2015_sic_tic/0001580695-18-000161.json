RISK FACTORS.\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to the oil and gas industry. The following discusses some of the key inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations. Other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this report also could adversely affect our business and operations, and these risk factors should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that may affect us.\nFor risk factors regarding AgEagle, its business operations and financial results, which will become our business operations and financial results following the consummation of the Merger, see the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on October 20, 2017.\nRisks Related to Recent Developments\nDue to our substantial liquidity concerns, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOn October 19, 2017, EnerJex entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc., a Nevada corporation (\u201cAgEagle\u201d), which designs, develops, produces, and distributes technologically advanced small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drones) that are supplied to the agriculture industry, and AgEagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AgEagle, Merger Sub will cease to exist and AgEagle will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The respective boards of directors of EnerJex and AgEagle have approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nAt the effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d), the shares of AgEagle capital stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive equal to 85% of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis. In addition, at the Effective Time all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of AgEagle common stock will be assumed by the Company and converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock. No fractional shares of Company common stock will be issued in the Merger but will be rounded to the nearest whole share. Following the consummation of the Merger, former stockholders of AgEagle with respect to the Merger are expected to own 85% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock (inclusive of the AgEagle assumed stock options and warrants), and current common and Series A Preferred stockholders of the Company are expected to own 15% of the Company, excluding shares of common stock that may be issued in connection with the conversion of the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, and not including any additional shares which may be issued in connection with the Company\u2019s closing obligation to provide up to $4 million in new working capital and the elimination of all liabilities currently on the Company\u2019s balance sheet.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company will also file a proxy statement seeking stockholder approval to: (a) amend the terms of its Series A Preferred Stock (as discussed below); (b) approve the issuance of the Company\u2019s shares in connection with the Merger to the AgEagle shareholders and new investors, in excess of 19.9% of the Company\u2019s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock; (c) approve the issuance of shares to current Company management and directors in lieu of deferred salary and fees, a majority of which will be held in escrow to secure the Company\u2019s indemnity obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (d) change the name of the Company to \u201cAgEagle Aerial Resources, Inc.\u201d\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, immediately following the Effective Time, the existing board of directors and officers of the Company will resign and new directors and officers will be appointed by AgEagle.\nThe Company intends to dispose of its principal assets, consisting primarily of its Kansas oil and gas properties, concurrently with the closing of the Merger. In the event the Merger is not consummated, the Company does not have a present intention to dispose of the above described assets.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among other things: (a) the approval of the stockholders of the Company and AgEagle (which Company shareholder approval has been received to date); (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by each of the Company and AgEagle and the compliance by each of the Company and AgEagle with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement; (c) approval of the stockholders of the Company for the issuance of its common stock and any other securities (x) to the AgEagle stockholders in connection with the Merger and (y) in connection with the financing transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) approval for the listing of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to be issued in the Merger and other related transactions on the NYSE American; and (e) that all of the Company\u2019s assets as disclosed shall have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and the corresponding debt and liabilities shall have been extinguished. The Company\u2019s existing cash resources are insufficient to satisfy all of its outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, in order to satisfy the condition and consummate the Merger, the Company will be required to raise additional funding prior to the closing of the Merger, the failure of which could result in the Company\u2019s failure to consummate the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants obligating each of the Company and AgEagle to continue to conduct its respective business in the ordinary course, to provide reasonable access to each other\u2019s information and to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and coordinate to make any filings or submissions that are required to be made under any applicable laws or requested to be made by any government authority in connection with the Merger. The Merger Agreement also contains a customary \u201cno solicitation\u201d provision pursuant to which, prior to the earlier of January 31, 2018, or the completion or termination of the Merger, neither the Company nor AgEagle may solicit or engage in discussions with any third party regarding another acquisition proposal unless, in the Company\u2019s case, it has received an unsolicited, bona fide written proposal that the recipient\u2019s board of directors determines is or would reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal. The Company has paid AgEagle a $50,000 non-refundable fee at the signing of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights in favor of each of the Company and AgEagle.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement contains provisions for indemnification in the event of any damages suffered by either party as a result of breaches of representations and warranties contained therein. The aggregate maximum indemnification obligation of any indemnifying party for damages with respect to breaches of representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $350,000, other than fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach. An indemnifying party shall satisfy its indemnification obligations with shares of Company common stock equal to the aggregate amount of losses of the indemnified party, calculated based upon the greater of (i) the value of the Company common stock as of the closing of the Merger; and (ii) the average closing price of the Company common stock on the NYSE American for the five trading days immediately prior to the date such a claim is made. The Company has agreed to deposit an aggregate of 1,215,278 shares of common stock to be issued to current officers and directors of the Company in lieu of deferred salary and fees into escrow to secure its indemnification obligations, the issuance of such shares requiring the approval of the Company\u2019s common stockholders.\nIn connection with, and as a condition to the closing of the Merger, the Company is seeking the consent of the holder of its Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) to amend the terms thereof to: (i) allow the Company to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends up to September 30, 2017 in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock based on the value of the liquidation preference thereof, (ii) eliminate the right of the Series A Preferred Stock holders to receive any dividends accruing after September 30, 2017, and (iii) convert each share of Series A Preferred Stock into 10 shares of Company common stock. An affirmative vote of 66.7% of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock voting as a class as of the record date of the proxy statement is required to amend the terms of the Certificate of Designation to provide for these changes, as required under the Merger Agreement. As of September 30, 2017, the Series A Preferred Stock had accrued a total of $6,039,972 in accrued but unpaid dividends, which would result in an additional 241,599 shares of Series A Preferred Stock being issued by the Company to satisfy these accrued dividends.\nThe Merger Agreement provides either party the right to terminate the Merger if it has not been consummated by January 31, 2018, provided that if all of the conditions to closing shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, the required closing date may be extended until March 31, 2018. On January 31, 2018, the Company extended the required closing date with AgEagle to March 31, 2018.\nShould we not be able to close this transaction, our existing and future debt agreements become due and that will threaten our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will seek to negotiate an extension of such indebtedness or may seek bankruptcy protection if this transaction is not approved by the shareholders.\nIn the event the Merger closes, it will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders and a change of control of the Company.\nAs described above, we are party to a Merger Agreement with AgEagle relating to the acquisition by us of the outstanding securities of AgEagle. We anticipate the consideration exchanged with AgEagle for the securities of AgEagle will be 85% of our total outstanding securities on a fully-diluted basis. Additionally, we anticipate issuing other securities in connection with the Merger, including, but not limited to, in order to raise funding in connection therewith. As such, in the event the contemplated transaction closes, the issuance of the common stock consideration to AgEagle and to other parties will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of our then shareholders and result in a change of control of the Company.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could adversely impact competing proposals to acquire us. These provisions include the prohibition on us generally from soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. These provisions might discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our company from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the current proposed Merger consideration.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf we will not realize the benefits expected from the Merger, including a potentially enhanced competitive and financial position, expansion of operations, and will instead be subject to all the risks we currently face as an independent company;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees;\n\u25cf the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of AgEagle, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger; and\n\u25cf matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among other things: (a) the approval of the shareholders of the Company and AgEagle (which Company shareholder approval has been received to date); (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by each of the Company and AgEagle and the compliance by each of the Company and AgEagle with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement; (c) approval of the shareholders of the Company for the issuance of its common stock and any other securities (x) to the AgEagle shareholders in connection with the Merger and (y) in connection with the financing transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) approval for the listing of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to be issued in the Merger and other related transactions on the NYSE American; and (e) that all of the Company\u2019s assets as disclosed shall have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and the corresponding debt and liabilities shall have been extinguished. The Company\u2019s existing cash resources are insufficient to satisfy all of its outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, in order to satisfy the condition and consummate the Merger, the Company will be required to raise additional funding prior to the closing of the Merger, the failure of which could result in the Company\u2019s failure to consummate the Merger Agreement. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by March 31, 2018, either we or AgEagle may choose not to proceed with the Merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval. In addition, we or AgEagle may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company.\nIn the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may have been adversely impacted by our failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seek another business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration provided for by the Merger.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause partners and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential new partners to delay doing business with us until the Merger has been successfully completed. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business following the Merger could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Merger is completed or terminated without the consent of AgEagle. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nWe have substantial indebtedness which is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 obligations under the credit agreement and note are non-recourse and are secured by a first-priority lien in the Company\u2019s and the subsidiaries\u2019 oil properties and assets located in Kansas. The Company was removed as a borrower under the Credit Agreement, but entered into a Guaranty of Recourse Carveouts, pursuant to which the Company guarantees the Subsidiaries\u2019 payment of certain fees and expenses due under the Credit Agreement, and may be liable for certain conduct, such as fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, and waste of the Kansas oil properties or assets. In the event we fail to repay our debts our creditors may enforce their security interests and foreclose on our assets, which would likely cause any investment in the company to become worthless.\nCurrent volatile market conditions and significant fluctuations in energy prices may continue indefinitely, negatively affecting our business prospects and viability.\nThe oil and gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Further declines in the price of oil and natural gas will have a material adverse effect on our planned operations and financial condition. Additionally, the amount of any royalty payment we receive from the production of oil and gas from our oil and gas interests will depend on numerous factors beyond our control.\nWe are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time) and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American (provided that issuers can also be delisted if any shares of the issuer trade below $0.06 per share); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. As described below, the NYSE American has previously provided us a deficiency letter due to our common stock trading below $0.20 per share.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe are currently not in compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards and if we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. The NYSE American will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not meet its continued listing standards. If we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE American may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock.\nWe may be unable to comply with NYSE American continued listing standards. Our business has been and may continue to be affected by worldwide macroeconomic factors, which include uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. External factors that affect our stock price, such as liquidity requirements of our investors, as well as our performance, could impact our market capitalization, revenue and operating results, which, in turn, could affect our ability to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing standards. The NYSE American has the ability to suspend trading in our common stock or remove our common stock from listing on the NYSE American if in the opinion of the exchange: (a) the financial condition and/or operating results of the Company appear to be unsatisfactory; or (b) it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of our common stock has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the exchange inadvisable; or (c) we have sold or otherwise disposed of our principal operating assets, or have ceased to be an operating company; or (d) we have failed to comply with our listing agreements with the exchange (which include that we receive additional listing approval from the exchange prior to us issuing any shares of common stock, something we have inadvertently failed to comply with in the past); or (e) any other event shall occur or any condition shall exist which makes further dealings on the exchange unwarranted.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company received notice from NYSE Regulation, Inc. that it is not in compliance with certain NYSE American (\u201cNYSE American\u201d) continued listing standards relating to stockholders\u2019 equity. Specifically, the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.0 million or more if an issuer has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d).\nOn November 20, 2017, the Company filed a plan of compliance with the proposed steps the Company will take to regain compliance with all applicable criteria for listing on the NYSE American and in particular Section 1003(a)(i). The plan was based in significant part upon the Merger and the associated financing.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Company was notified by the NYSE American that NYSE Regulation had accepted the Company\u2019s plan to regain compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing standards of the Company Guide by April 17, 2019, subject to periodic review by the NYSE American for compliance with the initiatives set forth in the plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by April 17, 2019, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, the NYSE Regulation staff may initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.\nAdditionally, on February 28, 2018, the Company received notification (the \u201cDeficiency Letter\u201d) from the NYSE American that the Company\u2019s shares of common stock have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time. Pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the NYSE American staff determined that the Company\u2019s continued listing is predicated on it effecting a reverse stock split of its common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the staff determined to be until August 28, 2018. The Company\u2019s common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE American while it attempts to regain compliance with the Listing Standards, subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with other continued listing requirements, as described above. The Deficiency Letter does not affect the Company\u2019s business operations or its Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nAt the present time, the Company has obtained shareholder approval to effectuate a reverse stock split at a ratio of between one-for-two and one-for-twenty five with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of the Directors of the Company. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is currently assessing which ratio would best serve the Company\u2019s stockholders while allowing the Company to remain compliant with the NYSE American continued listing requirements.\nIf we are unable to retain compliance with the NYSE American criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the NYSE American might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Additionally, if we were delisted from the NYSE American and we are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among other things, registration statements on Form S-1 are subject to SEC review and comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form S-3 are not.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American, it would come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of shareholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nUntil we repay the full amount of our outstanding credit facility, we may continue to have substantial indebtedness, which is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nWhile our bank sold its rights under our credit facility to the successor lender, and the successor lender has agreed to a transaction in which we can contribute certain of our assets, our shares in Oakridge Energy, and reduce our loan amount from $17,925,000 to a restated note in the original principal amount of $4,500,000, subject to a $1,200,000 discount provided that we repay the successor lender $3,300,000 prior to the original maturity date of November 1, 2017, which has been extended to March 23, 2018 and can be extended to April 30, 2018. In exchange we can retain our Kansas oil and gas assets. Unless and until this transaction closes (which is dependent on the approval of our stockholders), we will remain in default on our obligations, and the successor lender may enforce its rights as secured parties and we will likely lose all of our Kansas assets and may be forced to liquidate the Company.\nWe are unable to fulfill our obligations under our credit facility which is adversely affecting our business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $4,457,347 under the credit facility. Our substantial indebtedness, and the related interest expense, could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022 our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 being forced to use cash flow to reduce our outstanding balance as a result of an unfavorable borrowing base redetermination;\n\u2022 our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less leverage;\n\u2022 our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and changes in government regulation;\n\u2022 our ability to, or increasing the cost of, refinancing our indebtedness; and\n\u2022 our ability to enter into marketing, hedging, optimization and trading transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nThe covenants in our Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nThe credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness and provide additional guarantees;\n\u2022 pay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022 create or permit certain liens;\n\u2022 use the proceeds from the sales of our oil and gas properties;\n\u2022 use the proceeds from the unwinding of certain financial hedges;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries.\nThe credit facility also contains various affirmative covenants with which we are required to comply. At December 31, 2017, we were not in compliance with certain covenants. The Company has extended the restated secured note to March 23, 2018 and has an option to extend the maturity date of the restated secured note to April 30, 2018, upon payment of an extension fee of $50,000.\nOur 2017 oil and gas reserve report shows a material decline in our estimated reserves, which will have adverse implications to our business.\nOur 2017 oil and gas reserve report shows a material decline in our estimated reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. For example, estimates of quantities of proved reserves and their PV10 value are affected by changes in crude oil and gas prices, because estimates are based on prevailing prices at the time of their determination. Further, reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in any exact way, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another.\nCurrent volatile market conditions and significant fluctuations in energy prices may continue indefinitely, negatively affecting our business prospects and viability.\nThe oil and gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Further declines in the price of oil and natural gas will have a material adverse effect on our planned operations and financial condition. Additionally, the amount of any royalty payment we receive from the production of oil and gas from our oil and gas interests will depend on numerous factors beyond our control.\nWe may continue to incur substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would adversely impact our earnings.\nWe review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting. Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of oil and gas properties, less deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated \u201cceiling.\u201d The ceiling limitation is (a) the present value of future net revenues computed by applying current prices of oil & gas reserves (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil & gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of 10 percent and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized less (d) income tax effects related to differences between book and tax basis of properties. Future cash outflows associated with settling accrued retirement obligations are excluded from the calculation. Estimated future cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an un-weighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.\nAny excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as additional depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) in the statement of operations. The ceiling calculation is performed quarterly. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no impairment charges were recorded.\nFuture conditions might require us to make write-downs in our assets, which would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nWe review our long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on December 31 of each year, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. If conditions in any of the businesses in which we compete were to deteriorate, we could determine that certain of our assets were impaired and we would then be required to write-off all or a portion of our costs for such assets. Any such significant write-offs would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with our Industry\nOil and gas prices are volatile. Future price volatility may negatively impact cash flows which could result in an inability to cover our operating and/or capital expenditures.\nOur future revenues, profitability, future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on the prices we realize for our oil and gas production. Our realized prices may also affect the amount of cash flow available for operating and/or capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.\nOil and gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in or perceptions regarding supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Among the factors that can cause this volatility are:\n\u2022 commodities speculators;\n\u2022 local, national and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022 worldwide or regional demand for energy, which is affected by economic conditions;\n\u2022 the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas;\n\u2022 weather conditions;\n\u2022 natural disasters;\n\u2022 acts of terrorism and war;\n\u2022 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022 political and economic conditions in oil and gas producing countries, including those in the Middle East and South America;\n\u2022 impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and gas prices;\n\u2022 the availability of refining capacity;\n\u2022 actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other state controlled oil and gas companies relating to oil and gas price and production controls; and\n\u2022 the price and availability of other fuels.\nIt is impossible to predict oil and gas price movements with certainty. A drop in oil and gas prices may not only decrease our future revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices would materially and adversely affect our future business enough to potentially force us to cease our business operations. In addition, our reserves, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance and execute planned capital expenditures will also suffer in such a price decline.\nDeclining economic conditions and worsening geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Markets in the United States and elsewhere have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 5 years, due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financial markets generally. The consequences of a potential or prolonged recession may include a lower level of economic activity, decreasing demand for petroleum products and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets.\nIn addition, actual and attempted terrorist attacks in the United States, Middle East, Southeast Asia and Europe, and war or armed hostilities in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, North Africa, Iran, North Korea or elsewhere, or the fear of such events, could further exacerbate the volatility and disruption to the financial markets and economies.\nWhile the ultimate outcome and impact of the current economic conditions cannot be predicted, a lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in energy consumption, which may materially adversely affect the price of oil and gas, our revenues, liquidity and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also may affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital.\nThe threat and impact of terrorist attacks, cyber attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations.\nWe cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general, and on us in particular, either in the short-term or in the long-term. Uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines and gathering systems, production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could be targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, a cyber attack or electronic security breach, or an act of war.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our operations depend on the demand for oil and used oil, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil, gas and oil and gas related products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves numerous uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development, exploitation and exploration activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of a well does not ensure a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their cost, unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u2022 unexpected operational events and/or conditions;\n\u2022 reductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022 title problems;\n\u2022 oil and gas quality issues;\n\u2022 pipe, casing, cement or pipeline failures;\n\u2022 natural disasters;\n\u2022 fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, pollution and other risks or accidents;\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;\n\u2022 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022 uncontrollable flows of oil or natural gas or well fluids.\nIf we experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, gathering systems and processing facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022 injury or loss of life;\n\u2022 severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022 clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022 regulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u2022 suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022 repairs to resume operations.\nBecause we use third-party drilling contractors to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of worker compensation laws in dealing with their employees. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could impact our operations enough to force us to cease our operations.\nApproximately 85.3% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 consist of undeveloped reserves, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced.\nOur estimated total proved PV10 (present value) before tax of reserves as of December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million, versus $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Of the 0.5 million BOE of total proved reserves, approximately 14.7% are classified as proved developed producing and approximately 85.3% are classified as proved undeveloped.\nAssuming we can obtain adequate capital resources, we plan to develop and produce all of our proved reserves, but ultimately some of these reserves may not be developed or produced. Furthermore, not all of our undeveloped or developed non-producing reserves may be produced in the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all. For further information please see the disclosures in \u201cNote 14 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information (Unaudited)\u201d to the Financial Statements included herein.\nBecause we face uncertainties in estimating proved recoverable reserves, you should not place undue reliance on such reserve information.\nOur reserve estimates and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves at December 31, 2017 were prepared by Cobb & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum consultant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and cash flows from such reserves, including factors beyond our control and the control of these independent consultants and engineers. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that can be economically extracted, which cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to these reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices, expenditures for future development and exploitation activities, and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserves and future cash flows may also be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history, development and exploitation activities and oil and gas prices. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and value of cash flows from those reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates in our reserve reports. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classification of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. In addition, reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The estimated quantities of proved reserves and the discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to those reserves included in this report were prepared by Cobb & Associates, Inc. in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and are not intended to represent the fair market value of such reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022 geological conditions;\n\u2022 assumptions governing future oil and gas prices;\n\u2022 amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022 availability of funds;\n\u2022 future operating and development costs;\n\u2022 actual prices we receive for oil and gas;\n\u2022 changes in government regulations and taxation; and\n\u2022 capital costs of drilling new wells\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of our properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general.\nThe differential between the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, or other benchmark price of oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil production in Texas, Colorado and Kansas are typically based on a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The prices we receive for our natural gas production in Colorado is based upon local market conditions but generally we receive a discount to Henry Hub. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and gas differentials. In recent years for example, production increases from competing North American producers, in conjunction with limited refining and pipeline capacity have widened this differential. Recent economic conditions, including volatility in the price of oil and gas, have resulted in both increases and decreases in the differential between the benchmark price for oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows by decreasing the proceeds we receive for our oil and gas production in comparison to what we would receive if not for the differential.\nDrilling wells is speculative, and any material inaccuracies in our forecasted drilling costs, estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect our business.\nDeveloping and exploring for oil and gas involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oil and gas field equipment and related services. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil and gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economic. Our initial drilling and development sites, and any potential additional sites that may be developed, require significant additional exploration and development, regulatory approval and commitments of resources prior to commercial development. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our business operations as proposed and would be forced to modify our plan of operation.\nDevelopment of our reserves, when established, may not occur as scheduled and the actual results may not be as anticipated. Drilling activity and lack of access to economically acceptable capital may result in downward adjustments in reserves or higher than anticipated costs. Our estimates will be based on various assumptions, including assumptions over which we have control and assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. We have control over our operations that affect, among other things, acquisitions and dispositions of properties, availability of funds, use of applicable technologies, hydrocarbon recovery efficiency, drainage volume and production decline rates that are part of these estimates and assumptions and any variance in our operations that affects these items within our control may have a material effect on reserves. The process of estimating our oil and gas reserves is extremely complex, and requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Our estimates may not be reliable enough to allow us to be successful in our intended business operations. Our actual production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will likely vary from those anticipated. These variances may be material.\nUnless we replace our oil and gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flows and income.\nUnless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and gas production, and, therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:\n\u2022 unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them;\n\u2022 unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or\n\u2022 outbid by competitors.\nIf we are unable to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and income will decline as production declines, until our existing properties would be incapable of sustaining commercial production.\nIn order to exploit successfully our current oil and gas leases and others that we acquire in the future, we will need to generate significant amounts of capital.\nThe oil and gas exploration, development and production business is a capital-intensive undertaking. In order for us to be successful in acquiring, investigating, developing, and producing oil and gas from our current mineral leases and other leases that we may acquire in the future, we will need to generate an amount of capital in excess of that generated from our results of operations. In order to generate that additional capital, we may need to obtain an expanded debt facility and issue additional shares of our equity securities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in either obtaining that expanded debt facility or issuing additional shares of our equity securities, and our inability to generate the needed additional capital may have a material adverse effect on our prospects and financial results of operations. If we are able to issue additional equity securities in order to generate such additional capital, then those issuances may occur at prices that represent discounts to our trading price, and will dilute the percentage ownership interest of those persons holding our shares prior to such issuances. Unless we are able to generate additional enterprise value with the proceeds of the sale of our equity securities, those issuances may adversely affect the value of our shares that are outstanding prior to those issuances.\nA significant portion of our potential future reserves and our business plan depend upon secondary recovery techniques to establish production. There are significant risks associated with such techniques.\nWe anticipate that a significant portion of our future reserves and our business plan will be associated with secondary recovery projects that are either in the early stage of implementation or are scheduled for implementation subject to availability of capital. We anticipate that secondary recovery will affect our reserves and our business plan, and the exact project initiation dates and, by the very nature of water flood operations, the exact completion dates of such projects are uncertain. In addition, the reserves and our business plan associated with these secondary recovery projects, as with any reserves, are estimates only, as the success of any development project, including these water flood projects, cannot be ascertained in advance. If we are not successful in developing a significant portion of our reserves associated with secondary recovery methods, then the project may be uneconomic or generate less cash flow and reserves than we had estimated prior to investing the capital. Risks associated with secondary recovery techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 higher than projected operating costs;\n\u2022 lower-than-expected production;\n\u2022 longer response times;\n\u2022 higher costs associated with obtaining capital;\n\u2022 unusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022 fluctuations in oil and gas prices;\n\u2022 regulatory changes;\n\u2022 shortages of equipment; and\n\u2022 lack of technical expertise.\nIf any of these risks occur, it could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nAny acquisitions we complete are subject to considerable risk.\nEven if we make acquisitions that we believe are good for our business, all acquisitions involve potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022 the validity of our assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022 an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022 a decrease in our liquidity by using our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022 a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022 the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage the acquired properties or assets;\n\u2022 the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges;\n\u2022 unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic or geological areas; and\n\u2022 customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often incomplete or inconclusive.\nOur reviews of acquired properties can be inherently incomplete because it is not always feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, plugging or orphaned well liability are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nWe must obtain governmental permits and approvals for drilling operations, which can result in delays in our operations, be a costly and time consuming process, and result in restrictions on our operations.\nRegulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuances in the regions in which we operate. Compliance with the requirements imposed by these authorities can be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration or production operations and/or fines. Regulatory or legal actions in the future may materially interfere with our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we are often required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that a proposed project may have on the environment, threatened and endangered species, and cultural and archaeological artifacts. Accordingly, the permits we need may not be issued, or if issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably.\nDue to our lack of geographic diversification, adverse developments in our operating areas would materially affect our business.\nWe currently only lease and operate oil and gas properties located in Kansas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these properties caused by significant governmental regulation, transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions or other events which impact this area.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for all, or a substantial amount of our sales. If these customers reduce the volumes of oil and gas they purchase from us, our revenue and cash flow will decline to the extent we are not able to find new customers for our production.\nIn Kansas, we sell oil to Coffeyville Resources. There are approximately six potential purchasers of oil in Kansas. If a key purchaser were to reduce the volume of oil it purchases from us, our revenue and cash available for operations will decline to the extent we are not able to find new customers to purchase our production at equivalent prices.\nWe are not the operator and we have limited control over the activities on those properties.\nWe are not the operator of our Mississippian Project, and our dependence on the operator of this project limits our ability to influence or control the operation or future development of this project. Such limitations could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital related to exploration, drilling or production activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nWe may suffer losses or incur liability for events for which we or the operator of a property have chosen not to obtain insurance.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in producing and transporting oil and gas, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, pipeline ruptures, spills, and acts of terrorism, all of which can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury claims and other damage to our and others\u2019 properties. As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. As a result of market conditions, existing insurance policies may not be renewed and other desirable insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on processing facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our ability to market our oil and gas production and could harm our business.\nThe marketability of our oil and gas production will depend in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and oil and gas processing facilities. The amount of oil and gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of available capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we will be provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in pipeline capacity or the capacity of processing facilities could significantly reduce our ability to market our oil and gas production and could materially harm our business.\nCost and availability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our development, exploitation and exploration plans.\nShortages or an increase in cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel could delay or interrupt our operations, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Drilling activity in the geographic areas in which we conduct drilling activities may increase, which would lead to increases in associated costs, including those related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. Increased drilling activity in these areas may also decrease the availability of rigs. We do not have any contracts for drilling rigs and drilling rigs may not be readily available when we need them. Drilling and other costs may increase further and necessary equipment and services may not be available to us at economical prices.\nOur exposure to possible leasehold defects and potential title failure could materially adversely impact our ability to conduct drilling operations.\nWe obtain the right and access to properties for drilling by obtaining oil and gas leases either directly from the hydrocarbon owner, or through a third party that owns the lease. The leases may be taken or assigned to us without title insurance. There is a risk of title failure with respect to such leases, and such title failures could materially adversely impact our business by causing us to be unable to access properties to conduct drilling operations.\nOur reserves are subject to the risk of depletion because many of our leases are in mature fields that have produced large quantities of oil and gas to date.\nA significant portion of our current operations are located in or near established fields in Kansas. As a result, many of our leases are in, or directly offset, areas that have produced large quantities of oil and gas to date. As such, our reserves may be negatively impacted by offsetting wells or previously drilled wells, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur lease ownership may be diluted due to financing strategies we may employ in the future.\nTo accelerate our development efforts we may take on working interest partners who will contribute to the costs of drilling and completion operations and then share in any cash flow derived from production. In addition, we may in the future, due to a lack of capital or other strategic reasons, establish joint venture partnerships or farm out all or part of our development efforts. These economic strategies may have a dilutive effect on our lease ownership and could significantly reduce our operating revenues.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nDevelopment, production and sale of oil and gas in the United States are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 location and density of wells;\n\u2022 the handling of drilling fluids and obtaining discharge permits for drilling operations;\n\u2022 accounting for and payment of royalties on production from state, federal and Indian lands;\n\u2022 bonds for ownership, development and production of oil and gas properties;\n\u2022 transportation of oil and gas by pipelines;\n\u2022 operation of wells and reports concerning operations; and\n\u2022 taxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil and gas spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Accordingly, any of these liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations enough to possibly force us to cease our business operations.\nOur operations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental, operational safety and other matters.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and safety requirements applicable to our oil and gas production activities. We may also be exposed to the risk of costs associated with Kansas Corporation Commission requirements to plug orphaned and abandoned wells on our oil and gas leases from wells previously drilled by third parties. In addition, we may indemnify sellers or lessors of oil and gas properties for environmental liabilities they or their predecessors may have created. These costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including regulations and enforcement policies, which have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs, liens and to a lesser extent, issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our operations.\nStrict, joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. If we are not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our ability to operate effectively could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may have greater resources than do we.\nThe oil and gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies, many of which are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil and gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Such companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, such companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and gas market prices. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to compete, our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with our Stock\nWe have ceased paying dividends on our Series A preferred stock, causing the trading price of the preferred stock to dramatically decline\nOn November 4, 2015, we announced that we would not be declaring the monthly dividend for the month of November 2015 on our 10.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock in order to preserve our cash resources. We have not declared the monthly dividend since. The failure to declare and pay monthly dividends on our preferred stock caused its trading price to decline substantially.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends to holders of our common stock because of the terms of our debt facility, and our need to reinvest cash flow from operations in our business.\nIt is unlikely that we will pay any dividends to the holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The terms of our debt facility require that the lender approve any such distributions, and the lender is unlikely to provide that consent so long as we have significant unpaid indebtedness outstanding.\nWe have derivative securities currently outstanding and we may issue derivative securities in the future. Exercise of the derivatives will cause dilution to existing and new stockholders.\nThe exercise of our outstanding options and warrants, will cause additional shares of common stock to be issued, resulting in dilution to our existing and future common stockholders\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of our common stock and preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval, which could cause your investment to be diluted.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The power of the board of directors to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuance of our common stock, or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock, or debt instruments that may be convertible into common or preferred stock, may have the effect of diluting one\u2019s investment.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NYSE American and our Series A preferred stock is traded on the OTC PINK, daily trading volumes are small making it difficult for investors to sell their shares.\nOur common stock and our Series A preferred stock trade under the symbol \u201cENRJ,\u201d and \u201cENRJP,\u201d respectively but trading volume has been minimal. Therefore, the market for our common stock is limited. The trading price of our stock could be subject to wide fluctuations. Investors may not be able to purchase additional shares or sell their shares within the time frame or at a price they desire.\nThe price of our common stock and Series A preferred stock may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at a favorable price.\nRegardless of whether an active trading market for our stock develops, the market price of our stock may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to the following factors could affect our stock price:\n\u2022 our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income or loss per share, net income or loss and revenues;\n\u2022 changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts about us or the exploration and production industry;\n\u2022 potentially limited liquidity;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our reserve estimates and quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in oil and gas prices;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by significant stockholders and future issuances of our common stock;\n\u2022 increases in our cost of capital;\n\u2022 changes in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings and enforcement and legal actions;\n\u2022 commencement of or involvement in litigation;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022 general market conditions, including fluctuations in and the occurrence of events or trends affecting the price of oil and gas; and\n\u2022 domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation, restated bylaws and Nevada Law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of us.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and common stock without stockholder approval. The election by our board of directors to issue Series A preferred stock, and any future election to issue more preferred stock, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In addition, provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Furthermore, Nevada\u2019s \u201cCombination with Interested Stockholders\u2019 Statute\u201d and its \u201cControl Share Acquisition Statute\u201d may have the effect in the future of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of us.\nThese statutory anti-takeover measures may have certain negative consequences, including an effect on the ability of our stockholders or other individuals to (i) change the composition of the incumbent board of directors; (ii) benefit from certain transactions which are opposed by the incumbent board of directors; and (iii) make a tender offer or attempt to gain control of us, even if such attempt were beneficial to us and our stockholders. Since such measures may also discourage the accumulations of large blocks of our common stock by purchasers whose objective is to seek control of us or have such common stock repurchased by us or other persons at a premium, these measures could also depress the market price of our common stock. Accordingly, our stockholders may be deprived of certain opportunities to realize the \u201ccontrol premium\u201d associated with take-over attempts.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. You may not receive funds without selling your stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy with regard to our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, investment opportunities and restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments, including the consent of debt holders and holders of Series A Shares, if applicable at such time, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nShareholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.\nWherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nAdditional Risks and Uncertainties\nWe are an oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development company. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, irrespective of whether those risks are described in this section or elsewhere in this report, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 14720, "SIC": 3721, "TIC": "UAVS"}
