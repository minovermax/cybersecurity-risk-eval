{"cik": "1359555", "company": "Pendrell Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks below address some of the factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Patents and Monetization Activities\nSuccess of our licensing efforts depends on our ability to enter into new license agreements or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights.\nIP licensing revenues are dependent on our ability to enter into new license agreements with, or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights against, users of our patented inventions. If users refuse to sign or renew license agreements, we may need to resort to litigation or other measures to compel the payment of fair consideration, which to date has not been effective, and may not be effective in the future. This risk applies not only to new license agreements, but to existing license agreements with fixed expiration dates. If we fail to sign or renew license agreements on terms that are favorable to us or obtain favorable outcomes through litigation or other enforcement actions, the value of our IP could be further impaired.\nRevenue opportunities from our IP monetization efforts are limited.\nPatents have finite lives. Our IP portfolio currently consists of patents that expire between 2016 and 2033. If we fail to develop or acquire new patentable inventions prior to the expiration of our patents, our IP revenue opportunities will be limited.\nWe may have a limited number of prospective licensees.\nThe patent portfolios that we own are applicable to only a limited number of prospective licensees. As such, if we are unable to enter into licenses with this limited group, licensing revenue will be adversely impacted. For instance, if the trial results in the Google Litigation and Apple Litigation (as such terms are defined below in Item 3 of Part I) are affirmed on appeal, there will be very few mobile device manufacturers that have not either signed a license with ContentGuard or otherwise resolved ContentGuard\u2019s claims against them.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy, and our licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThe process of licensing to customers can be lengthy, sometimes spanning a number of years. We have incurred and expect to incur significant legal and sales expenses prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. We also expect to spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on\nthe benefits of a license arrangement with us. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue is generated. Moreover, if our portfolio is not demonstrably applicable to prospective licensees\u2019 products or services, whether due to poor quality, lack of breadth or otherwise, parties may refuse to enter into license agreements.\nEnforcement proceedings may be costly and ineffective and could lead to impairment of our IP assets.\nWe may choose to pursue litigation or other enforcement action to protect our intellectual property rights, such as the Apple Litigation and Google Litigation. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex, and might require cooperation of inventors and others who are unwilling or unable to assist with enforcement. Litigation also involves several stages, including the potential for a prolonged appeals process. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. As occurred during our fourth quarter in 2015, we might receive rulings or judgments, or enter into licenses or settlement agreements, that compel us to revalue the IP assets that we are enforcing, which in turn might result in a reduction to the financial statement carrying value of such assets through a corresponding impairment charge. Enforcement actions will likely divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations. In certain cases, we may conclude that these costs and risks outweigh the potential benefits that would arise from successful enforcement, in which event we may opt not to pursue enforcement.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by product composition and future innovation.\nOur licensing revenues have been generated from manufacturers and distributors of products that use our patented inventions. Our business prospects could be negatively impacted if prospective licensees do not use our inventions in their products, or if they later modify their products to eliminate use of our inventions. Moreover, changes in technology or customer requirements could alter product composition and render our patented inventions obsolete or unmarketable.\nOur staff reductions could harm our IP monetization efforts.\nAs we continue to explore investment opportunities that are not premised on the value of IP, we have significantly reduced our IP licensing and legal staff. The smaller staff might be less capable of pursuing and concluding IP license transactions. Even if our remaining team effectively pursues IP license transactions, certain users of our patented inventions might conclude that we will be less diligent in protecting our rights, and therefore may be reluctant to engage in licensing discussions. This in turn might render enforcement of our rights more time-consuming and costly.\nChallenges to the validity or enforceability of our key patents could significantly harm our business.\nOur assets include patents that are integral to our business and revenues. Prospective licensees or competitors may challenge the validity, scope, enforceability and ownership of our patents. Their challenges may include review requests in the relevant patent and trademark office, such as the inter partes review and covered business method proceedings initiated by ZTE, Apple and Google. Review proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and we cannot predict their outcome or consequences. Such proceedings may narrow the scope of our claims or may cancel some or all of our claims. If some or all of our patent claims are canceled, we could be prevented from enforcing or earning future revenues from such patents. Even if our claims are not canceled, enforcement actions against alleged infringers may be stayed pending resolution of reviews, or courts or tribunals reviewing our patent claims could make findings adverse to our interests based on facts presented in review proceedings. Irrespective of outcome, review challenges may result in substantial legal expenses and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from our other business operations, including our ability to evaluate and acquire other businesses. Adverse decisions could impair the value of our inventions or result in a loss of our proprietary rights and may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change, and may alter protections afforded to owners of patent rights, impose additional enforcement risks, increase the costs of enforcement, or increase our licensing cycles. For instance, during 2013 and 2015, legislative initiatives were introduced to address perceived patent abuses by non-practicing entities. Even if legislative initiatives do not directly impact our business, such initiatives might encourage manufacturers to infringe our IP rights, lengthen our licensing cycles, increase the likelihood that we will litigate to enforce our IP rights, or make it more difficult and expensive to license our patents or enforce our patents against parties using our inventions without a license. Moreover, increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions.\nChanges of interpretations of patent law could adversely impact our business.\nOur success in review and enforcement proceedings relies in part on the historically consistent application of patent laws and regulations. Interpretations of patent laws and regulations by the courts and applicable regulatory bodies have evolved, and may continue to evolve, particularly with the introduction of new laws and regulations. Changes or potential changes in judicial interpretation could have a negative impact on our ability to monetize our patent rights.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition Activities\nWe may over-estimate the value of assets or businesses we acquire.\nWe make investments from which we intend to generate a return. We estimate the value of these investments prior to acquisition, using both objective and subjective methodologies. If we over-estimate such value, we may not generate desired returns on our investment, or we may need to adjust the value of the investments to fair value and record a corresponding impairment charge, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may not capitalize on acquired assets.\nEven if we accurately value the investments we make, we must succeed in generating a return on the investments. Our success in generating a return depends on effective efforts of our employees and outside professionals. If we do not generate desired returns on our investments or if we are compelled to adjust the value of the investments to fair value and record a corresponding impairment charge, it could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may pursue other acquisition or investment opportunities that do not yield desired results.\nWe intend to continue investigating potential acquisitions that support our business objectives and strategy. Acquisitions are time-consuming, complex and costly. The terms of acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we may incur significant transactional expenses, regardless of whether or not acquisitions are consummated. Moreover, the integration of acquired companies prompts significant challenges, and we can provide no assurances that the integration of acquired businesses with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate from such acquisitions. Investigating businesses and assets and integrating newly acquired businesses or assets may be costly and time-consuming, and such activities could divert our attention from other business concerns. In addition, we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, the assumption or incurrence of contingent liabilities, possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances, any of which could negatively impact our financial position. We might not be successful in integrating acquired businesses and might not achieve desired revenues and cost benefits.\nThe financing of our acquisition activities could threaten our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nWe have substantial historical net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for United States federal income tax purposes. As explained in greater detail below, our use of our NOLs will be significantly limited if we undergo a \u201cTax Ownership Change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. If and to the extent we finance acquisitions through the sale or issuance of stock, we will likely cause an ownership shift that increases the possibility that a future Tax Ownership Change might occur. If a Tax Ownership Change occurs, we will be permanently unable to use most of our NOLs.\nWe rely on representations, warranties and opinions from third parties that might not be accurate.\nWhen we acquire assets or businesses or establish relationships with inventors or strategic partners, we may rely on representations and warranties made by third parties. We also may rely on opinions of lawyers and other professionals. We may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such representations, warranties and opinions are made. By relying on these representations, warranties and opinions, we may be exposed to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nOur financial and operating results have been and may continue to be uneven.\nOur operating results may fluctuate and, as such, our operating results are difficult to predict. You should not rely on quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period or that could adversely affect our operating results include the timing of license and sales agreements, compliance with such agreements, the terms and conditions for payment under those agreements, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, costs of enforcement, changes in demand for products that incorporate our inventions, the time period between commencement and completion of license negotiations or enforcement proceedings, revenue recognition principles, and changes in accounting policies.\nOur revenues have not and may not offset our operating expenses.\nThrough the first quarter of 2015, we acquired IP assets and expanded the reach and scope of our IP business. We also incurred expenses to hire new personnel, including employees for IP services, patent research and analysis, development of reporting systems and general and administrative functions and to pay legal fees for IP enforcement activities. As a result, our costs exceeded our revenues, and although we substantially scaled back our expansion efforts and our costs in 2015, we anticipate that costs may continue to exceed revenues. If we are not successful in generating revenue that is sufficient to offset our expenses, our financial position will be negatively impacted.\nFailure to effectively manage the composition of our employee base could strain our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on continued contributions of our key managers and employees, many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace. Our success also depends on the ability of our personnel to function effectively, both individually and as a group. Recently, we terminated the employment of certain individuals (including IP consultants) whose roles we believe were unnecessary to advance our current and anticipated business strategies. If we misjudged our ongoing personnel needs or lose any of our remaining senior managers or key personnel, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our clients or licensees, which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business. Moreover, if we fail to manage the composition of our employee base effectively or otherwise strain our relationships with our personnel, our business and financial results may be materially harmed.\nIf we need financing and cannot obtain financing on favorable terms, our business may suffer.\nWe have relied on revenues from clients and licensees and existing cash reserves to finance our operations. If we deploy a significant portion of our capital or encounter unforeseen difficulties in the future that deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated, we may need to obtain additional financing. Financing might not be available on favorable terms, if at all, may dilute our existing shareholders, and may prompt us to pursue structural changes that could impact shareholder concentration and liquidity. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture changes in standards, rules, practices or interpretation may impact our financial results.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretations by the SEC and various accounting bodies. In addition, we are subject to various taxation rules in many jurisdictions. The existing taxation rules are generally complex, voluminous, frequently changing and often ambiguous. Changes to existing taxation rules, changes to the financial accounting standards, or any changes to the interpretations of these standards or rules, or changes in practices under these standards and rules, may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, other contractual relationships and patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our confidential and proprietary information, our technology and our intellectual property. We cannot be certain that these protections have not been and will not be breached, that we will be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our trade secrets or intellectual property, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If we are unable to detect in a timely manner the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce our rights under our agreements or applicable laws, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business.\nOur company has an evolving business model, which raises doubt about our ability to increase our revenues and grow our business.\nWe have recently shifted our principal focus away from the IP business and are evaluating opportunities that provide more reliable cash flow with greater growth potential. As a result of our evolving business model, our opportunities must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development. We may not be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues and otherwise grow our business as we execute on new business opportunities in the future.\nRisks Related to our Tax Losses\nWe cannot be certain that our tax losses will be available to offset future taxable income.\nA significant portion of our NOLs were triggered when we disposed of our satellite assets. We believe these NOLs can be carried forward to offset certain future taxable income. However, the NOLs have not been audited or otherwise validated by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). We cannot assure you that we would prevail if the IRS were to challenge the amount or our use of the NOLs. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some amount of our NOLs would not be available to offset future taxable income which would result in an increase to our future income tax liability. The NOL carryforward period begins to expire in 2025\nwith the bulk of our NOLs expiring in 2032. If the tax laws are amended to limit or eliminate our ability to carry forward our NOLs for any reason, or to lower income tax rates, the value of our NOLs may be significantly reduced.\nAn Ownership Change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may significantly limit our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income.\nOur use of our NOLs will be significantly limited if we undergo a Tax Ownership Change. Broadly, a Tax Ownership Change will occur if, over a three-year testing period, the percentage of our stock, by value, owned by one or more 5% shareholder increases by more than 50 percentage points. For purposes of this test, shareholders that own less than 5% of our stock are aggregated into one or more separate \u201cpublic groups,\u201d each of which is treated as a 5% shareholder. In general, shares traded within a public group are not included in the Tax Ownership Change test. Despite our adoption of certain protections against a Tax Ownership Change (such as our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan), we cannot control the trading activity of our significant shareholders. If shareholders acquire or divest their shares in a manner or at times that do not account for the loss-limiting provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations adopted thereunder, a Tax Ownership Change could occur. If a Tax Ownership Change occurs, we will be permanently unable to use most of our NOLs.\nOur NOLs cannot be used to offset the Personal Holding Company tax.\nThe Internal Revenue Code imposes an additional tax on the undistributed income of a Personal Holding Company (\u201cPHC\u201d). In general, a corporation is classified as a PHC if 50% or more of its outstanding shares, measured by value, are owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individual shareholders at any time during the second half of a calendar year (\u201cConcentrated Ownership\u201d) and at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income is Personal Holding Company Income (\u201cPHCI\u201d). Broadly, PHCI includes items such as dividends, interest, rents and royalties, among others. Pendrell or ContentGuard may meet the Concentrated Ownership test in 2016. Also, it is possible that action or inaction by our significant shareholders or by Time Warner (the 10% owner of ContentGuard) could cause Pendrell or ContentGuard to meet the Concentrated Ownership test. If Pendrell or ContentGuard meet the Concentrated Ownership test and generate positive net PHCI, Pendrell or ContentGuard will be subject to the PHC tax on undistributed net PHCI. The PHC tax, which is in addition to the income tax, is currently levied at 20% of the net PHCI not distributed to the corporation\u2019s shareholders.\nOur NOLs cannot be used to completely offset the Alternative Minimum Tax or other taxes.\nWe may also be subject to the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) in a year in which we have net taxable income because the AMT cannot be completely offset by available NOLs, as losses carried forward generally can offset no more than 90% of a corporation\u2019s AMT liability. In addition, our federal NOLs will not shield us from foreign withholding taxes, state and local income taxes, or revenue-based taxes incurred in jurisdictions that impose such taxes.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent on the generation of future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before the expiration of the carry forward period attributable to the NOLs, which begin to expire in 2025. We did not generate taxable income in 2013, 2014 or 2015, and we may not generate sufficient taxable income in future years to use the NOLs before they begin expiring.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nIf we are delisted from Nasdaq, our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). We must satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \u201cListing\nRule\u201d), which requires listed companies to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. On September 24, 2015, the closing bid price of our Class A Common Stock fell below $1.00 and has remained below $1.00. On November 5, 2015, Nasdaq notified us that we do not comply with the Listing Rule and that we have 180 days to comply with the Listing Rule. We may regain compliance if the price of our Class A Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time during the 180 day cure period. If we fail to comply with the Listing Rule within that time period, and fail to extend the compliance time period, Nasdaq may delist our stock, in which case our stock (i) may be more thinly traded, making it more difficult for our shareholders to sell shares, (ii) may experience greater price volatility, and (iii) may not attract analyst coverage, all of which may result in a lower stock price. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, increased employee turnover, and fewer business development opportunities.\nIf we remedy our Class A common stock price deficiency with a reverse stock split, our Class A common stock price might decrease.\nIn order to regain compliance with the Listing Rule, we may need to implement a reverse stock split. A reverse stock split could decrease the trading volume in our Class A common stock, which could cause the price of the Class A common stock to decrease following the reverse stock split.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock could depress the market price.\nThe average trading volume of our Class A common stock is low in relation to the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell shares in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nA sale of a large number of shares by our largest shareholders could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nA small number of our shareholders hold a majority of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, which is convertible at the option of the holders into Class A common stock. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with the interests of other Class A holders.\nEagle River Satellite Holdings, LLC, together with its affiliates Eagle River Investments, LLC, Eagle River, Inc. and Eagle River Partners, LLC (collectively, \u201cEagle River\u201d) controls approximately 65% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Eagle River has control over the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our governing documents, the adoption or prevention of mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets, or control changes. Eagle River is not restricted or prohibited from competing with us.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nEagle River controls approximately 65% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards, and therefore may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors,\nand (iii) the requirement that director nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process. We do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, but reserve the right to do so in the future. If we choose to do so, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nOur Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (\u201cTax Benefits Plan\u201d), as well as certain provisions in our restated articles of incorporation, may discourage takeovers, which could affect the rights of holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur Tax Benefits Plan is intended to act as a deterrent against any person or group acquiring or otherwise obtaining beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our securities without the approval of our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation require us to take all necessary and appropriate action to protect certain rights of our common shareholders, including voting, dividend and conversion rights and rights in the event of a liquidation, merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets. Our articles of incorporation also provide that we will not avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of those rights by charter amendment, entry into an inconsistent agreement or reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution or the issuance or sale of securities. The rights protected by these provisions of the articles of incorporation include our Class B common shareholders\u2019 right to ten votes per share on matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and option to convert each share of Class B common stock into one share of Class A common stock. The provisions of the Tax Benefits Plan and our articles of incorporation could discourage takeovers of our company, which could adversely affect the rights of our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 86270, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "PCOA"}
