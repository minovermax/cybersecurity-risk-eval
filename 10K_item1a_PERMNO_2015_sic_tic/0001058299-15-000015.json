{"cik": "1058299", "company": "LIONBRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Lionbridge\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating Lionbridge and its business.\nA large portion of Lionbridge\u2019s revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large clients and the delay or reduction of its clients\u2019 product releases and production schedules or the loss of, or reduction in revenue from, a major client could negatively affect Lionbridge\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\nLionbridge derives a significant portion of its revenues from large projects and programs for a limited number of large clients. In addition, a significant portion of Lionbridge\u2019s revenue is linked to the product release cycles and production schedules of its clients, and, in particular, to certain key clients. As a result, Lionbridge performs varying amounts of work for specific clients from year-to-year based on their product release cycles and production schedules. A major client in one year may not have use for a similar level of Lionbridge\u2019s services in another year. Although we generally enter into long-term contracts with our clients, the volume of work we perform for specific clients may vary from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. Our contracts may allow our clients to terminate the contract early. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these major clients or that, if we were to lose one or more of our major clients, we would be able to replace such clients with clients that generate a comparable amount of revenues. A number of factors could cause us to lose business or revenue from a client, and some of these factors are not predictable and are beyond our control. For example, a client may demand price reductions, change its procurement strategy, move work in-house or reduce previously forecasted demand. In most cases, if a client terminates its contract with us or does not meet its forecasted demand, we have no contractual recourse even if we have hired and trained service professionals to provide services to the client. Consequently, the loss of one or more of our major clients, or the inability to generate anticipated revenues from them, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile our strategy of focusing on serving large enterprises is intended to enable us to increase our revenues from large corporate customers, this strategy also exposes us to increased risks arising from the possible loss of major customer accounts.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Lionbridge\u2019s largest client accounted for 21%, 24% and 19% of its total revenue, respectively, and its ten largest clients accounted for 57%, 58% and 56% of its total revenue, respectively. As a result, the loss of any major client or division of a major client from which we generate significant revenues or a significant reduction in a large project\u2019s scope could materially reduce Lionbridge\u2019s revenue and cash flow, and adversely affect its ability\nto maintain profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company saw a spend reduction of $16.6 million from its largest client.\nFluctuations in the mix of customer demand for the Company\u2019s various types of solution offerings could impact Lionbridge\u2019s financial performance and impact Lionbridge\u2019s ability to forecast performance.\nDue to fluctuations in customer needs, changes in customer industries, and general economic conditions, customer demand for the range of the Company\u2019s offerings varies from time to time and is not predictable. In relation to the Company\u2019s GLC segment, customer localization requirements for high quality translation services may be affected by the mix of graphics and words in a particular language or the format through which it desires to communicate the content, thereby reducing the amount of content suitable for high quality, professional human-based translation. In addition, Lionbridge gross margins vary by customer and by segment and the mix of services provided to its customers could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations as certain of Lionbridge\u2019s customers and segments have different gross margin profiles. Generally, the profitability of an account increases over time. As a result, the mix of solutions provided by Lionbridge to its customers varies at any given time, both within a quarter and from quarter-to-quarter. These variations in service mix impact gross margins and the predictability of gross margins for any period. Therefore, Lionbridge believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful. You should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of Lionbridge\u2019s future performance. Lionbridge may not experience profitability or margin increases in future years comparable to those experienced in some prior years.\nProcurement strategies and vendor consolidation as well as unfavorable conditions in the United States and global economies may adversely affect demand for Lionbridge\u2019s services, which would in turn, adversely affect future revenues and operating results.\nMany of Lionbridge\u2019s clients are seeking to consolidate their current service providers. In some cases, the range and breadth of our service offerings is not as broad as its customers demand. Lionbridge\u2019s ability to sustain growth and our profitability in the current environment is dependent upon its ability to maintain and/or gain a greater share of the business within its clients, and to attract new clients. There can be no assurance that Lionbridge will be able to do so in the future.\nMore generally, future unfavorable changes in global economic and political conditions, including economic and monetary instability in Europe, inflation, fluctuating energy costs, geopolitical issues, and unrest may contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and global economic growth going forward. Instability in global economic conditions could negatively impact business and customer spending patterns. More specifically, Lionbridge\u2019s customers or potential customers may cancel, reduce or delay their purchases of our solutions or payment for such solutions, which would adversely impact our revenues, collections of customer receivables and ultimately our profitability.\nThe Company cannot predict global economic conditions or when and to what extent these conditions may affect our customers. The Company cannot ensure that its business financial condition or results of operations will not be adversely impacted by any negative economic conditions.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute on any of our identified business strategic opportunities or other business or strategic opportunities that we determine to pursue.\nIn order to pursue business and strategic opportunities, we will need to continue to build our infrastructure, our service and technology offerings and our operational capabilities. Our ability to do any of these successfully could be affected by one or more of the following factors:\n-\nour ability to recruit resources with specific language, technical and subject matter skills on a global basis;\n-\nthe ability of our technology to perform as we expect;\n-\nour ability to execute our strategy and continue to operate a large, more diverse business efficiently on a global basis;\n-\nability to effectively manage our third party relationships;\n-\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n-\nour ability to effectively manage our global employee and supplier costs and other expenses, particularly outside of the United States;\n-\nour ability to expand the range of solutions offered to our customers;\n-\ntechnology and application failures and outages, interruption of service, security breaches or fraud which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our clients;\n-\nour ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry and the evolving technology, service and pricing demands of the markets we serve; and\n-\nour ability to raise additional capital to fund our growth.\nOur failure to adequately address the above factors would have a significant impact on our ability to implement our business plan and our ability to pursue other opportunities that arise, which might negatively affect our business.\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business.\nLionbridge has made strategic acquisitions in 2014 and 2013, and on January 7, 2015 acquired CLS Communication, a privately-held provider of translation solutions to clients in the financial services, industrial, public sector and life sciences markets. We expect to continue making acquisitions as part of our long-term business strategy. Lionbridge may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, or Lionbridge may not realize the anticipated benefits as quickly as originally anticipated, which could adversely affect Lionbridge\u2019s business, financial condition or results or operations. In particular, the process of integrating acquired companies into the Company\u2019s existing business may result in unforeseen risks. These risks include:\n-\ndifficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n-\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n-\ndifficulty in integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting systems, human resources and other administrative systems;\n-\nfailure of acquired technologies and services to perform as expected;\n-\nloss of a customer or changes in relationships with customers of the acquired company;\n-\nloss of key employees of an acquired company;\n-\nentering markets in which Lionbridge has no, or limited, prior experience;\n-\nmisjudgment with respect to value;\n-\nan inability to consummate any such transaction;\n-\nincreased costs of compliance associated with doing business in additional jurisdictions;\n-\ncosts associated with infrastructure upgrades and investments related to the integration of the acquired company;\n-\ndelays or difficulty to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses on the original timetable;\n-\ndisruption to Lionbridge business and diversion of management\u2019s attention and financial resources; and\n-\nunforeseen and significant problems or liabilities associated with quality, technology, tax and legal matters related to an acquisition.\nPotential fluctuations in Lionbridge\u2019s quarterly results make financial forecasting difficult and could affect its common stock trading price.\nAs a result of fluctuations in Lionbridge\u2019s revenues tied to foreign currency fluctuations, its clients\u2019 activities and release cycles, customer and vendor pricing pressures, the three-to nine-month length of its typical sales cycle, historical growth, acquisition activity, the emerging nature of the markets in which it competes, global economic conditions and other factors outside its control, Lionbridge believes that financial forecasting is difficult and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful. You should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of Lionbridge\u2019s future performance. Lionbridge may not experience revenue increases in future years comparable to the revenue increases in some prior years. There have been quarters in the past in which Lionbridge\u2019s results of operations have fallen below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and this may occur in the future. If in a future quarter Lionbridge\u2019s results of operations were to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of its common stock would likely decline.\nDefects or disruptions in Lionbridge\u2019s web-based tool and service offerings (including interruptions in service due to third parties) could diminish demand for those offerings and subject the Company to liability.\nCloud-based offerings may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Since Lionbridge\u2019s customers use our web-based services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with the Company\u2019s service could hurt its reputation and may damage Lionbridge\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to Lionbridge, the Company could lose future subscribers or customers may make warranty claims against Lionbridge, which could result in an increase in the Company\u2019s provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\nLionbridge currently serves its customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located on the east coast of the United States. Any damage to, or failure of, these facilities could result in interruptions in its service. As Lionbridge continues to add capacity to its data centers, it may move or transfer data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of Lionbridge\u2019s service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, Lionbridge\u2019s systems generally could result in interruptions in its service. Interruptions in Lionbridge\u2019s service may reduce its revenue, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect the Company\u2019s renewal rates and its ability to attract new customers. Lionbridge\u2019s business will also be harmed if its customers and potential customers believe the Company\u2019s service is unreliable.\nEvolving regulation of the Internet may affect Lionbridge adversely.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies may occur. For example, the Company believes increased regulation may occur in the area of data privacy and in status of employment. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm Lionbridge\u2019s web-based tools and services business as well as reduce demand for its services by customers that provide Internet-based services.\nDemand for subscription fee-based translation tools such as Lionbridge\u2019s and demand for the Company\u2019s high quality translation services could decline if effective tools and solutions become available for free.\nPresently there are a number of free translation tools offering limited access to machine translation and translation management applications. If these free offerings become more sophisticated or comprehensive, and become better able to produce more accurate translations and production efficiencies, demand for Lionbridge\u2019s solutions and products, particularly its real-time machine translation offering known as GeoFluent, may decline.\nOur infrastructure is dependent on third party technologies that may be difficult to deploy, integrate, or replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service.\nWe rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties as the basis for operational and internal operations and are dependent on these systems in order to conduct our internal business operations and to offer our services to our customers. Integrating, maintaining and upgrading this infrastructure is expensive and complex. Delays in implementation, inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of critical internal or customer data, could diminish the quality and/or timeliness of our services to customers and the information we utilize to make internal business and financial decisions. We have recently deployed an SAP-based system for timekeeping and human resources functionality which we expect will result in process efficiencies, higher quality data and generate cost savings; however, unanticipated failures or defects in the system may affect the data we utilize to measure our business productivity, pay our resources and provide services to our customers. Any such failure or defect may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, third party technologies may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in providing services to our customers, managing our resources, and performing essential business operations, until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated. In addition, any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. As a result, we may experience contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and governmental investigations, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nLionbridge\u2019s expansion into web-based product and services offerings may not succeed and may harm its financial results and reputation.\nLionbridge offers its web-based language technologies on a subscription basis. The Company\u2019s current cloud-based products include Translation WorkspaceTM and GeoFluentTM. These cloud-based offerings are available to translators and enterprises on a subscription basis, independent of otherwise engaging Lionbridge as the translation services provider. Lionbridge is providing Translation Workspace on a subscription basis to individual translators and agencies for their use with their customers, as well as to enterprises. Lionbridge has also offered GeoFluent to corporations and enterprises engaged in real-time, web-based communications.\nLionbridge also allows customers to procure a range of its services through a web-based platform on self-service basis through its On-Demand service offerings.\nLionbridge will continue to devote capital, personnel and management attention to developing these new services and offerings. These services and offerings will present technological, marketing and management challenges that differ from the challenges the Company faces in its existing localization business. The success of this expansion and Lionbridge\u2019s future growth and profitability in connection with this initiative will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain customers and subscribers and to constantly improve the tools and solutions offered and adapt them to changing customer needs. Lionbridge cannot assure you that these web-based solutions and strategies will be successful or that they will be profitable, or if they are profitable, that they will provide an adequate return on capital expended. If Lionbridge is not successful in marketing, selling, developing and deploying these new solutions, its financial results and reputation may be harmed.\nIn addition, the market for cloud-based translation solutions is emerging and it is uncertain whether cloud-based services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Lionbridge\u2019s successful expansion into new cloud-based product offerings will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of translators and enterprises, large and small, to subscribe to cloud-based tools and services for translation requirements. Some potential users may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services because they have concerns regarding the risk associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If they do not perceive the benefits of subscribing to cloud-based tools and services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than the Company expects, either of which may adversely affect Lionbridge\u2019s financial results.\nA failure by Lionbridge to comply with the covenants under its revolving credit facility could trigger a default under that facility if not cured.\nLionbridge\u2019s failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under its revolving credit agreement could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the Company being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. There is no guarantee that the Company would be able to refinance these borrowings and the failure to refinance would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. If the Company is forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs, rates and terms.\nLionbridge\u2019s results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nLionbridge conducts a large portion of its business in international markets. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, 31% and 32% of Lionbridge\u2019s revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, 59% and 61% of its costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies. Therefore, the Company is exposed to the risk of an increase in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which would increase the value of those expenses when measured in U.S. Dollars. Lionbridge\u2019s foreign subsidiaries have assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity\u2019s functional currency. Changes in the functional currency value of certain assets and liabilities create fluctuations that may result in translation gains or losses. Management selectively engages in foreign exchange hedging transactions (typically, forward contracts) designed to minimize its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Management regularly reviews the hedging program and will make adjustments as necessary, including suspending or accelerating hedging activities based on its judgment of the efficacy of such programs under anticipated market and economic conditions. However, there can be no assurance that our foreign currency management strategy will adequately protect our financial condition or results of operation from the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations.\nLionbridge may not realize the anticipated benefits of current or future cost reduction initiatives.\nLionbridge has initiated cost reduction actions to improve its operating cost structure, reduce overhead and better position itself competitively. It expects to implement additional cost reduction and restructuring actions in order to realize synergies\nwith its acquisitions, particularly its acquisition of CLS Communications on January 7, 2015. These cost reduction initiatives include measures designed to better align operating expenses with expected revenue levels, resource reallocations, headcount reductions and technology deployments. The timing and implementation of cost reduction initiatives is dependent upon a number of factors, including customer needs and transition requirements, local statutory and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions. Future cost reduction initiatives could result in current period charges and expenses that could impact Lionbridge\u2019s operating results. The anticipated benefits of these cost reduction actions may be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Lionbridge cannot guarantee that these measures, or other expense reduction measures we take in the future, will result in the expected cost savings.\nLionbridge may engage in restructuring actions and incur restructuring charges for actions undertaken in any particular quarter. In connection with determining the size and scope of any such restructuring charge, management will be required to make significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs, lease cancellation and other exit costs, and estimates of future rental income that may be generated through the subleasing of excess leased property. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted.\nLionbridge may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLionbridge engages resources in multiple countries worldwide and from time-to-time places them in workplaces of its customers. It is also involved in human capital management solutions that involve the recruitment and payment of individuals on a global basis. Lionbridge also may engage in redundancy or other reduction in force actions in light of any decline in demand for its services due to global economic conditions. From time to time, Lionbridge employees may elect to form labor unions which may impose additional burdens on our business. Risks related to these activities include:\n-\nclaims arising out of the actions or inactions of our personnel;\n-\nclaims of discrimination or harassment;\n-\nclassification of employees as independent contractors and payment of workers\u2019 compensation claims and other similar claims, including matters for which we may have indemnified a customer;\n-\nviolations of wage and hour requirements;\n-\nretroactive entitlement to employment benefits;\n-\ncosts of engaging in collective bargaining;\n-\nerrors and omissions by our personnel; and\n-\nclaims by our customers relating to our personnel misusing customer proprietary information, or other similar claims.\nLionbridge may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to its management team and costly and have a negative impact on its business. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will not experience these problems in the future.\nLionbridge cannot assure you that its insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that maybe asserted against the Company. Should the ultimate judgments and settlements exceed its insurance coverage, it could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future.\nOur international operations subject us to increased risk.\nWe have offices throughout the world. Our international operations account for a significant percentage of our total revenues, and our utilization of low cost delivery centers located outside of the United States is a key component of our ability to deliver our services successfully. Our international operations and revenue associated with those operations are subject to inherent risks, including:\n-\neconomic recessions in foreign countries;\n-\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls;\n-\npolitical instability, war or military conflict;\n-\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n-\ncomplexities and costs in effectively managing multi-national operations and associated internal controls and procedures;\n-\ntightened credit markets in particular geographies;\n-\nlimitations on our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries;\n-\nreduced protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n-\nchanges and complexities in tax and data privacy laws and regulations; and\n-\ncomplexities and costs associated with adapting our business model to ensure compliance with current and evolving regulations, client demands, and employee considerations.\nThe delivery of our services from many locations world-wide cause us to rely on data, phone, data, power and other networks which are not as reliable in certain of these locations as those in other countries where we operate. Any failures of these systems, or any failure of our systems generally, could affect our operations and revenues.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by military actions, global terrorism, natural disasters and political unrest.\nMilitary actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, global terrorism, natural disasters and political unrest in the Middle East and other countries are among the factors that may adversely impact regional and global economic conditions and our clients\u2019 ability, capacity and need to invest in our services. In addition to the potential impact of any of these events on the business of our clients, these events could pose a threat to our global operations and people. Additionally, hurricanes or other unanticipated catastrophes, both in the U.S. and globally, could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business as well as disrupt our clients\u2019 businesses, which may result in a further adverse impact on our business. As a result, significant disruptions caused by such events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions related to the allocation of income among our subsidiaries.\nWe enter into intercompany transactions with affiliated companies located in various tax jurisdictions around the world. Transfer prices for these transactions could be challenged by the various tax authorities resulting in additional tax liabilities, interest, and/or penalties, and the possibility of double taxation. If any of these tax authorities are successful in challenging our tax positions, our income tax expense may be adversely affected.\nIf Lionbridge fails to hire and retain professional staff, its ability to obtain and complete its projects could suffer.\nLionbridge\u2019s potential failure to hire and retain qualified employees could impair its ability to complete existing projects and bid for or obtain new projects and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on its business and revenue. Lionbridge\u2019s ability to grow and increase its market share largely depends on its ability to hire, train, retain and manage highly skilled employees, including project managers and technical, sales and marketing personnel. In addition, Lionbridge must ensure that its employees maintain their technical expertise and business skills. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees or that it will successfully train and manage the employees it hires to allow Lionbridge to carry out its operating plan.\nLionbridge\u2019s financial performance may be impacted by its ability to transition service execution to its lower cost operational sites, the timing of such transition, and customer acceptance of such transition.\nLionbridge\u2019s business strategy includes the transition of service execution to its global delivery centers located in India, China, Poland and Slovakia. The rate at which such services may be transitioned and the timing of any transition is difficult to predict and is dependent on customer demand for such services and customer acceptance of such any such transition. Accordingly, changes in the location of service execution may not produce the anticipated financial benefit and the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of service execution in its Global Delivery Centers to the extent anticipated, or as rapidly as anticipated, all of which could adversely affect Lionbridge\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDifficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, health, accounting and business factors could negatively affect Lionbridge\u2019s business in international markets.\nLionbridge conducts business and has operations and clients throughout the world. As a result, Lionbridge\u2019s business is subject to political unrest and economic fluctuations in various countries and to more cost-intensive social insurance and\nemployment laws and regulations, particularly in Europe. In addition, as Lionbridge continues to employ and retain personnel throughout the world and to comply with various employment laws, it may face difficulties in integrating such personnel on a cost-efficient basis. In the U.S. and certain other countries, new employment and labor laws and regulations have been proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies Lionbridge has in place to help reduce its exposure to these risks will be effective or that the Company will not experience losses as a result of these risks. Lionbridge may face difficulties and expense in reducing its workforce in certain high cost countries and regions, including Europe. If Lionbridge seeks to expand its operations, it may become more difficult to manage its international business. In addition, Lionbridge\u2019s ability to engage individual interpreters, translators, internet raters and other cloud workers as contractors rather than employees may be impacted by changes in employment laws, regulations and interpretations in certain jurisdictions, which may expose Lionbridge to additional costs and expenses. In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to Lionbridge\u2019s international operations increases the Company\u2019s cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose the Company to fines or penalties. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Controls (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and local laws. Violations of these law and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of Lionbridge\u2019s business and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. Although Lionbridge has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot guarantee compliance. Any such violations could materially damage the Company\u2019s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Lionbridge\u2019s and its clients\u2019 abilities to conduct business may also be affected by wars, political unrest, terrorism, natural disasters or the impact of diseases such as Ebola. Furthermore, as a result of operating in international markets, Lionbridge is subject to longer payment cycles from many of its customers and may experience greater difficulties in timely accounts receivable collections. If Lionbridge fails to manage these operations successfully, its ability to service its clients and grow its business will be seriously impeded.\nGoodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets represent a portion of Lionbridge\u2019s assets; any impairment of Lionbridge\u2019s goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets will adversely impact its net income.\nAt December 31, 2014, Lionbridge had goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets of approximately $63.5 million, net of accumulated amortization and depreciation, which represented approximately 31.0% of its total assets. Lionbridge\u2019s goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis. Goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets are also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Such events or conditions could include an economic downturn in the industries to which Lionbridge provides services, increased competition, an increase in operating or other costs, additional volatility in international currencies, the pace of technological improvements, or other information regarding Lionbridge\u2019s market value, such as a reduction in stock price to a price near or below the book value of the Company for an extended period of time. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. In 2012, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $4.0 million related to certain software license and capitalized development costs related to the automated machine translation technology licensed from IBM Corporation and $0.2 million related to the decision to offer for sale certain real property of the Company located in Wuppertal, Germany. Although the Company does not believe that an impairment of Lionbridge\u2019s remaining goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets exists at this time, in the event that such a condition or event occurs, we may record additional charges which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf Lionbridge does not respond to future advances in technology and changes in customer demands, its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe demand for Lionbridge\u2019s services may be substantially affected, in large part, by future advances in technology and changes in customer demands. Lionbridge\u2019s success will depend on its ability to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of its existing and prospective clients. Lionbridge cannot assure you that there will be a demand for its services in the future. Lionbridge\u2019s success in servicing its clients will be largely dependent on its development of strategic business solutions and methodologies in response to technological advances and client preferences. For example, Lionbridge\u2019s services are based on a hosted internet-based language technology platform, core components of which include Lionbridge\u2019s Translation Workspace technology.\nLionbridge\u2019s business may be harmed by defects or errors in the services it provides to its clients.\nMany of the services Lionbridge provides are critical to its clients\u2019 businesses. While Lionbridge maintains general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, defects or errors in the services it provides could interrupt its clients\u2019 abilities to provide services to their end users resulting in delayed or lost client revenue. This could damage Lionbridge\u2019s reputation through negative publicity, make it difficult to attract new, and retain existing customers and cause\ncustomers to terminate their contracts and seek damages. Lionbridge may incur additional costs to correct errors or defects. Lionbridge cannot assure you that its general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claims.\nImproper disclosure of employee and customer data could result in liability and harm Lionbridge\u2019s reputation.\nFrom time to time, Lionbridge\u2019s services involve the use, storage and transmission of confidential and/or personal data, including information of its employees and resources and sensitive customer information. We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store this sensitive information. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We are also required at times to manage, utilize, record and store sensitive or confidential data. As a result, we are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect this information. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure or recording of sensitive or confidential employee, client or customer data, whether through system failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and employees. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Lionbridge\u2019s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to its reputation in the marketplace.\nLionbridge\u2019s service delivery system is dependent on global electronic communications. System failures could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could cause Lionbridge to lose clients and subscribers and delay scheduled deliveries to customers.\nLionbridge\u2019s translation service offerings in particular are dependent on its ability to communicate to its global network of operational sites and translation experts, primarily through web-based communications technologies. As a result, Lionbridge is dependent upon its ability to protect computer and telecommunications equipment and systems against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications interruption or failure, natural disaster and other similar events. If Lionbridge experiences a temporary or permanent interruption affecting its access to our proprietary solutions, communications with global resources, or preventing its customers from accessing tools or solutions to which they have subscribed, Lionbridge\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected. While Lionbridge maintains property and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not adequately compensate the Company for all losses that it may incur.\nAlthough Lionbridge maintains general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that its existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The occurrence of errors could result in a loss of data to Lionbridge or its clients, which could cause a loss of revenues, failure to achieve product acceptance, increased insurance costs, legal claims, against Lionbridge, delays in payment to Lionbridge by clients, increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions, diversion of resources, injury to the Company\u2019s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Lionbridge\u2019s market share and, in turn, its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Lionbridge\u2019s security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or Lionbridge\u2019s data, the Company\u2019s services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using Lionbridge\u2019s service and the Company may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nWe frequently receive or have access to confidential information from our clients, including confidential client data that we use to develop or support solutions. If any person, including one of our employees, misappropriates client confidential information, or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, including an attack by computer programmers or hackers who may develop or deploy viruses, worms, or other malicious software programs, system failures or otherwise, we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or their customers. Further, any such compromise to our computer systems could disrupt our operations, as well as our clients\u2019 operations. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to Lionbridge\u2019s data or its customers\u2019 data, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and a loss of confidence in the security of the Company\u2019s service that would harm its future business prospects. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change Lionbridge may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or\nperceived breach of Lionbridge\u2019s security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s security measures could be harmed and Lionbridge could lose sales and customers.\nWe may be liable for breaches of confidentiality or data security, defects in the applications or systems we deliver or other material contract breaches that we may commit during the performance of our services (collectively, \u201cContract Breaches\u201d). In certain circumstances, we agree to unlimited liability for Contract Breaches. Additionally, we cannot be assured that any insurance coverage will be applicable and enforceable in all cases, or sufficient to cover substantial liabilities that we may incur. Further, we cannot be assured that contractual limitations on liability will be applicable and enforceable in all cases. Accordingly, even if our insurance coverage or contractual limitations on liability are found to be applicable and enforceable, our liability to our clients for Contract Breaches could be material in amount and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients.\nOur international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.\nLionbridge competes in highly competitive markets.\nThe markets for Lionbridge\u2019s services are very competitive. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will compete successfully against its competitors in the future. If Lionbridge fails to be competitive with other companies in the future, it may lose market share and its revenue could decline.\nThere are relatively few barriers preventing companies from competing with Lionbridge. Although Lionbridge owns proprietary technology, Lionbridge does not own any patented or other technology that, by itself, precludes or inhibits others from entering its market. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to Lionbridge\u2019s business. In addition to Lionbridge\u2019s existing competitors, Lionbridge may face further competition in the future from companies that do not currently offer globalization or testing services. Lionbridge may also face competition from internal globalization and testing departments of its current and potential clients. Technology companies, information technology services companies, business process outsourcing companies, web consulting firms, technical support call centers, hosting companies and content management providers may choose to broaden their range of services to include globalization or testing as they expand their operations internationally. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will be able to compete effectively with potential future competitors.\nLionbridge will continue to depend on intellectual property rights to protect its proprietary technologies, although it may not be able to successfully protect these rights.\nLionbridge relies on its proprietary technology to enhance some of its service offerings. Lionbridge\u2019s policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with its employees, outside consultants and independent contractors. Lionbridge also uses patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law in addition to contractual restrictions to protect its technology. Notwithstanding these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to obtain and use Lionbridge\u2019s proprietary technology without authorization. Although Lionbridge holds registered or pending United States patents and foreign patents covering certain aspects of its technology, it cannot be sure of the level of protection that these patents will provide. Lionbridge may have to resort to litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, to protect trade secrets or know-how, or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending its proprietary technology is expensive, could cause diversion of Lionbridge\u2019s resources and may not prove successful. The laws of other countries may afford Lionbridge little or no effective protection of its intellectual property rights.\nThe intellectual property of Lionbridge\u2019s customers may be damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost while in Lionbridge\u2019s possession, subjecting it to litigation and other adverse consequences.\nIn the course of providing globalization and testing services to Lionbridge\u2019s customers, Lionbridge takes possession of or is granted access to certain intellectual property of such customers, including unreleased versions of software and source code. In the event such intellectual property is damaged, misappropriated, stolen or lost, Lionbridge could suffer:\n-\nclaims under indemnification provisions in customer agreements or other liability for damages;\n-\ndelayed or lost revenue due to adverse customer reaction;\n-\nnegative publicity; and\n-\nlitigation that could be costly and time consuming.\nLionbridge has an accumulated deficit and may not be able to continue to achieve operating profit.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, Lionbridge achieved an operating profit of $11.0 million, $15.4 million, $10.2 million, respectively. Lionbridge has an accumulated deficit of $203.9 million as of December 31, 2014. Lionbridge intends to continue to invest in internal expansion, infrastructure, select acquisitions and its sales and marketing efforts. Lionbridge cannot assure you that it will continue to achieve operating profits in the future or will generate net income in the future.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect Lionbridge\u2019s effective tax rates.\nLionbridge is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Lionbridge\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Lionbridge is subject to the continual examination by tax authorities in certain jurisdictions, most notably in India, and the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although Lionbridge believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals, and could result in a material effect on the Company\u2019s income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If additional taxes are assessed, this could adversely impact Lionbridge\u2019s financial results.\nThe Indian taxing authorities issued assessment orders for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, March 31, 2009, and March 31, 2010 of our Indian subsidiary, Lionbridge Technologies Private Ltd. (\u201cLionbridge India\u201d). At issue in these assessments were several matters, the most significant of which was the redetermination of the arm\u2019s-length profit related to intercompany transactions (\u201cTransfer Pricing\u201d). We are currently contesting all years under exam, and note that they are all at various stages of the appeals process. If we do not prevail in our appeals, we may incur an additional tax liability along with related interest and penalties.\nLionbridge\u2019s future effective tax rate could be affected by the following factors: changes in tax laws, new interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in the amount and mix of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which Lionbridge operates, or by changes in the Company\u2019s assessment of its need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.\nIn general, Lionbridge\u2019s cash and net assets held outside of the United States are not legally restricted from being transferred to the United States in order to assist Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. (i.e. US Parent Company) with debt repayment, domestic capital expenditures, and other working capital requirements. In the event that a transfer did occur, such funds would be subject to applicable local withholding taxes and U.S. taxes in certain circumstances which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Determination of the potential deferred income tax liability on unrepatriated cash and cash equivalents is not practicable due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure and the overall complexity of the calculation.\nThe majority of Lionbridge\u2019s deferred tax assets currently have a valuation allowance recorded against them, based on management\u2019s review of both the positive and negative evidence and their determination that it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies. The most sizable deferred tax asset is recorded in the United States with a valuation allowance recorded against it. Changes in the Company\u2019s assessment of its need for a valuation allowance could have a substantial effect on its effective tax rate.\nChanges in accounting policies may affect Lionbridge\u2019s reported earnings and operating income.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules, their interpretation, or their application relative to changes in the Company\u2019s services or business could significantly change Lionbridge\u2019s reported earnings and could add significant volatility to these measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. Lionbridge\u2019s application of applicable accounting guidance involves interpretation and judgment, and may, as a result, delay the timing of revenue recognition or accelerate the costs associated with deferred revenue.\nIf future results are different than anticipated, there may be adjustments to stock-based compensation expense.\nLionbridge uses stock-based compensation as one of its central incentive and retention components for its key employees. A portion of stock-based compensation expense relates to long-term performance-based stock incentive awards, which will vest only if future revenue and/or profitability levels are met. If these revenue and/or profitability levels are not fully met, all or some portion of the equity will be forfeited, and previously recorded stock-based compensation expense will be adjusted which if material, could affect future earnings.", "PERMNO": 87172, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "LIOX"}
