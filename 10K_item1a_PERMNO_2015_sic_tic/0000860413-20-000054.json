{"cik": "860413", "company": "FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nLike other financial and bank holding companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry in general and us in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. You should consider carefully the following important factors in evaluating us, our business, and an investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to the Market and Our Business\nA decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur clients are located predominantly in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, our profitability largely depends on the general economic conditions in these areas.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value;\n\u2022future borrowing power of our clients may be reduced;\n\u2022the value of our securities portfolio may decline; and\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nAdditionally, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, including wars or international conflicts with respect to which the United States may or may not be directly involved in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world, unemployment, or other economic and geopolitical factors beyond our control, could further impact these local economic conditions and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nDeflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could also have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to lending risks.\nWe take on credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Our credit standards, procedures, and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly in light of market developments.\nWhile our loan portfolio is diversified across business sectors, it is concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans. As of December 31, 2019, we had $4.9 billion of commercial loans, including $3.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 54.4%of our total loan portfolio. These loans may involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans, as well as the collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2019, we had $2.7 billion of agricultural, construction, residential, and other real estate loans, representing approximately 29.9% of our total loan portfolio. Many of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in commodity prices, such as agriculture, livestock, and energy businesses, as well as businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in production of commodities. Changes in commodity products prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could result in increased delinquencies and foreclosures and could have an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of these loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could also reduce the number of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry, which could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations. Similarly, the occurrence of a natural or manmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nChanges in interest rates may have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our profitability.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures, and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Open Market Committee, affect interest income and interest expense.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also adversely affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including mortgage servicing rights, (3) our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets, and (4) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations portfolios. For example, rising interest rates could adversely affect our mortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause clients to apply for fewer mortgages. Similarly, rising interest rates would increase the required periodic payment for variable rate loans and may result in an increase in non-performing loans. Additionally, rising interest rates may increase the cost of our deposits, which are a primary source of funding. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material, adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates can also affect the slope of the yield curve. A decline in the current yield curve or a flatter or inverted yield curve could cause our net interest income and net interest margin to contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows, as well as the value of our assets. An inverted yield curve may also adversely affect the yield on investment securities by increasing the prepayment risk of any securities purchased at a premium. A flattening or inversion of the yield curve or a negative interest rate environment in the United States could create downward pressure on our net interest margin.\nChanges in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations or by reducing our margins and profitability. As of December 31, 2019, 51.4% of our loans were advanced to our clients on a variable or adjustable-rate basis. As a result, an increase in interest rates could result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures, and charge-offs and could necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, a decrease in interest rates could negatively impact our margins and profitability.\nChanges to United States trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges to United States trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, countries comprising the European Union or Middle East, Canada, and Mexico, and retaliatory tariffs by such countries, could materially harm our business. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our clients import or export, including, among others, agricultural and oil and gas products, could cause the prices of our clients\u2019 products to increase, which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our clients\u2019 margins, which would adversely impact their revenues, financial results, and ability to service debt. This in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOn October 1, 2018, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed to a new trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), which is subject to congressional approval and ratification by Canada, which may or may not be approved in 2020. In the event the agreement is not fully ratified in 2020, various components of the agreement may not be effective until 2021. The full impact of this agreement on us, our clients, and on the economic conditions in our region is currently unknown. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours and/or our clients' costs, demand for our clients' products, and/or the United States economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services businesses from time-to-time. These acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of acquired businesses after closing.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. Acquisitions of other companies or of financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to us in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.\nAcquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated. This risk includes unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired business. Anticipated benefits (such as cost savings from synergies or strategic gains from being able to offer product sets to a broader potential client base) may not be fully realized. It can take longer or require greater resources to achieve these benefits. It also may prove impossible to achieve them at all or in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.\nA number of specific factors could affect our ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions, some of which may depend on the nature of the business acquired. For example, if an acquisition includes loan portfolios, the extent of credit losses following completion of the acquisition could adversely affect our combined results of operations. Similarly, if an acquisition includes deposits, the extent of deposit attrition post-closing could adversely affect our combined results of operations. Acquisitions of banking companies typically include both loans and deposits, and the extent of any post-closing credit losses and deposit attrition could be affected by a number of factors, including the state of the economy following the acquisition and the quality of our pre-acquisition analysis of any acquired business. As another example, if an acquisition involves entering into new geographic or other markets, our inexperience with respect thereto may negatively impact our ability to take advantage of the opportunities anticipated to be presented in connection with any such expansion plans.\nOur ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the business we are acquiring, which can be limited. By way of example, anticipating accurately the results of litigation or governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of an acquisition, or may be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, is a difficult exercise at best, and the impact thereof may be materially underestimated. Furthermore, the extent to which client attrition from an acquired business actually is experienced by us may materially exceed our expectations. Our pre-acquisition review of the business may also impact our ability to prepare for and execute on the integration of an acquired business.\nAs a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory issues, including delays in obtaining required approvals. Our ability to make large acquisitions in the future may be negatively impacted as well by regulatory rules or future regulatory initiatives designed to limit systemic risk. If we were to experience any of the foregoing adverse effects in connection with an acquisition, our business and financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nDifficulties in identifying suitable opportunities or combining the operations of acquired entities or assets with our own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter into strategic contractual relationships may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from these acquisitions, investments, or relationships.\nInherent uncertainties exist when assessing, acquiring, or integrating the operations of another business or investment or relationship opportunity. We may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies relevant to an acquisition or strategic relationship. In addition, the markets and industries in which we and the potential acquisition and investment targets operate are highly competitive. Acquisition or investment targets may lose clients or otherwise perform poorly or unprofitably, or in the case of an acquired business or strategic relationship, cause us to lose clients or perform poorly or unprofitably. Future acquisition and investment activities and efforts to monitor newly acquired businesses or reap the benefits of a new strategic relationship may require us to devote substantial time and resources and may cause these acquisitions, investments, and relationships to be unprofitable or cause us to be unable to pursue other business opportunities.\nAfter completing an acquisition, we may find that certain material information was not adequately disclosed during the due diligence process or that certain items were not accounted for properly in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards. We may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity or assets. For example, we may fail to correctly assess the quality of the assets being acquired and could experience higher charge-offs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio; the total cost and time required to complete the integration successfully could be greater than estimated and result in higher acquisition costs than expected or a loss of market opportunity due to any such delay; we may be unable to deploy profitably funds acquired in an acquisition; or we may experience poor overall performance of the combined entity. Additionally, acquired companies or businesses may increase our risk of regulatory action or restrictions related to the operations of the acquired business or the regulatory requirements that apply to the combined business.\nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause clients to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, and we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively.\nIf we experience loan losses in excess of estimated amounts, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the composition of our loan portfolio, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, delinquency trends, economic conditions, and regular reviews of loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses. These assumptions and judgments are complex and difficult to determine given the significant uncertainty surrounding future conditions in the general economy and banking industry. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, or if banking authorities or regulations require us to increase the allowance for loan losses, our net income may be adversely affected. As a result, an increase in loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nLoss of deposits or a change in mix could increase the Company\u2019s funding costs.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We depend on checking and savings, negotiable order of withdrawal, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of client deposits as our primary source of funding. The availability of internet banking products has increased the mobility of client deposits. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase because the Company may lose deposits and replace them with more expensive sources of funding. Clients may shift their deposits into higher-cost products or the Company may need to raise its interest rates to remain competitive in the marketplace. Higher funding costs reduce the Company\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nMany of our loans and our obligations for borrowed money are priced based on variable interest rates tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). We are subject to risks that LIBOR may no longer be available, or may become unreliable, as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority ceasing to require the submission of LIBOR quotes as of December 31, 2021.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States as a reference rate for various financial contracts, including adjustable-rate loans, asset-backed securities, and interest rate swaps. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The announcement means the continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after 2021. The potential cessation of LIBOR quotes or the future unavailability or unreliability of LIBOR creates substantial risks to the banking industry, including us. Unless alternative rates can be negotiated, our variable-rate loans, funding and derivative obligations that specify the use of a LIBOR index, would no longer be able to adjust as anticipated. This would adversely affect our asset/liability management and could lead to more asset and liability mismatches and interest rate risk unless appropriate LIBOR alternatives are developed. It could also disrupt the capital and credit markets as a result of confusion or uncertainty.\nThe Federal Reserve has sponsored the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), which serves as a forum to coordinate and track planning as market participants currently using LIBOR consider (a) transitioning to alternative reference rates where it is deemed appropriate and (b) addressing risks in legacy contracts language given the possibility that LIBOR might cease publication. On April 3, 2018, the Federal Reserve began publishing three new reference rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). ARRC has recommended SOFR as the alternative to LIBOR, and published fallback interest rate consultations for public comment as well as a Paced Transition Plan to SOFR use. The Financial Stability Board has taken an interest in LIBOR and possible replacement indices as a matter of risk management. The International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO, has been active in this area and is expected to call on market participants to have backup options if a reference rate, such as LIBOR, ceases publication. The International Swap Dealers Association has published guidance on interest rate benchmarks and alternatives in July and August 2018. It cannot be predicted whether SOFR or another index or indices will become a market standard that replaces LIBOR, and if so, the effects on our clients, or our future results of operations or financial condition.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement replacement reference rates for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with borrowers, we may incur significant expense in effecting the transition and we may be subject to disputes or litigation with our borrowers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the replacement reference rates. The replacement reference rates could also result in a reduction in our interest income. We may also receive inquiries and other actions from regulators in respect to the Company's preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates.\nWe may be adversely affected by declining oil and gas prices, and declining demand for coal.\nOil and gas drilling and production in Wyoming and in the Bakken Formation in Montana and North Dakota have been important contributors to our region\u2019s economic growth. As of December 31, 2019, our direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was approximately $64.7 million in loan commitments, including approximately $47.2 million advanced to oil and gas service companies. As of December 31, 2019, we also had commitments to lend an additional $17.5 million to oil and gas borrowers. These borrowers may be significantly affected by volatility in oil and gas prices and declines in the level of drilling and production activity. A prolonged period of low oil and gas prices or other events that result in a decline in drilling activity could have a negative impact on the economies of our market areas and on our clients. We carefully monitor the impact of volatility in oil and gas prices on our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, 30.6% of our outstanding oil and gas loans were criticized.\nAdditionally, adverse developments in the demand for coal due to tightening environmental regulations, the suspension of new coal leasing on federal lands, slower growth in electricity demand, and fuel competition from low natural gas prices may impact the economies of the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.\nAdverse developments in the energy sector could have spillover effects on the broader economies of our market areas, including commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. The State of Wyoming derives a significant portion of its operating budget from energy extraction and related industries. As such, reductions in oil, gas, and coal-related revenues may have additional negative economic implications for the State of Wyoming. There is no assurance that our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will not be adversely impacted by increases in non-performing oil and gas loans, or by the direct and indirect effects of current and future conditions in the energy industry.\nReductions in interchange fees will reduce our associated income.\nAn interchange fee is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network\u2019s infrastructure and payment facilitation, and which is paid to debit, credit and prepaid card issuers to compensate them for the costs associated with card issuance and operation. In the case of credit cards, this includes the risk associated with lending money to clients. We earn interchange fees on these debit and credit card transactions, included in the payment services line item of the consolidated statements of income. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act limits the amount of interchange fees that may be charged for debit and prepaid card transactions by us as we have over $10.0 billion in total assets. To the extent interchange fees are reduced, our income from those fees will be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur goodwill may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates it is likely an impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, the Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of our market value, discounted cash flows, and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill of $621.6 million, or 30.9% of our total stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur reputation is very important to our ability to maintain, attract and retain client relationships.\nOur clients expect us to deliver personalized financial services with the highest standards of performance, professionalism, compliance, and ethics. Damage to our reputation could undermine retention of our current clients and our ability to attract potential clients while also impairing the confidence of our counterparties and vendors, the result of which affects our ability to effect transactions. Maintaining our reputation depends, in part, on our ability to identify and address issues that may arise such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, cyber-security, employee, client and other third party fraud, record-keeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. To maintain our reputation, we also must prevent third parties from infringing on the \u201cFirst Interstate Bank\u201d brand and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Our reputation or prospects could be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding our Company, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, reported in the news, or posted in other parts of the internet. Defending of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time-to-time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB issued amendments to its guidance on the credit impairment of financial instruments. The amendments, which will be effective for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019, would introduce a new impairment model based on current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d), rather than incurred losses. The CECL model would apply to most debt instruments, including loan receivables and loan commitments. The amendment may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, may cause volatility in our allowance for loan losses, may negatively impact our capital ratios, and the costs of collecting, reviewing, and analyzing the additional data required may have an adverse effect on our operational results. For additional information regarding changes in accounting standards, see \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Recent Authoritative Accounting Guidance\u201d included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our management team and directors.\nOur future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. We currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with five of our key executives: Kevin P. Riley, our president and chief executive officer; Marcy D. Mutch, our chief financial officer; Renee L. Newman, our chief strategy officer; Jodi Delahunt Hubbell, our chief operating officer; and Philip G. Gaglia, our chief risk officer. We do not have employment agreements with the other executives. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in retaining key employees or finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively.\nAs a result of low unemployment rates in our historical geographic footprint and the Northwest region of the United States, there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in our markets. It may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees at all management and staffing levels. Failure to attract and retain employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Furthermore, relatively low unemployment rates may lead to significant increases in salaries, wages, and employee benefits expenses as we compete for qualified and skilled employees, which could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in new governmental regulation and/or changes in existing regulation could have a material, adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF, and the banking system as a whole. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response, we believe, to the financial crisis as well as other factors, such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. The Company expects its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nRegulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, employment, monetary and other laws and regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations control the methods by which we conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance and govern financial reporting and disclosures. In addition, the Company is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations and governmental economic and monetary policies. Congress may enact legislation from time-to-time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time-to-time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The regulatory environment for financial institutions entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs, including those related to consumer credit, such as mortgage lending. Any regulatory changes could adversely and materially affect the Company.\nAny failure to comply with CRA, fair lending and other laws and regulations could lead to material penalties.\nWe must comply with the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations that impose non-discriminatory lending and other requirements on financial institutions. A failure to comply with these laws could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. In addition to actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies, including the FDIC and CFPB, who are responsible for enforcing these laws, our compliance with fair lending laws could be challenged in private class action litigation. The costs of defending any such challenge and any adverse outcome arising from such a challenge could damage our reputation or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the USA PATRIOT ACT, OFAC, the BSA and related FinCEN and FFIEC Guidelines and regulations and any failure to comply could result in material implications.\nWe are routinely examined by our regulators for compliance with the USA PATRIOT ACT, OFAC, the BSA and related FinCEN and FFIEC Guidelines. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and to fully comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for us, causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and significant civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these regulations. If any of the foregoing were to come to pass, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur total assets exceed $10 billion, which subjects us to heightened regulatory requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had consolidated total assets of $14.6 billion. This means that the Company is subject to various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more total assets, as imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, including compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve\u2019s enhanced prudential oversight requirements and a more frequent and enhanced regulatory examination regime. In addition, for compliance in certain areas such as consumer financial protection laws and regulations, the Bank, with $10 billion or more in total assets, is primarily examined by the CFPB, with the FDIC maintaining supervision over some consumer related regulations. The Bank previously was examined by the FDIC for compliance with consumer protection laws. The CFPB is a relatively new federal agency with evolving regulations and practices, causing some uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business.\nViolations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by clients, including actual damages, restitution and attorney's fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorney generals and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, client rescission rights and civil money penalties in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in delays or restrictions on mergers and acquisitions and expansionary activities we may wish to pursue, and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future.\nFederal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums, and limitations on the Company\u2019s activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. For example, in July 2013, the FDIC and the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us by adopting \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and, other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThat rule included minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The rule required unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. In addition, the final rule established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d that, once fully phased in and combined with established minimum common equity, risk-based assets capital, and total capital ratios, will exceed the prompt corrective action \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d thresholds. (According to the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution is \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater; and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.)\nIn January 2019, the phase-in of the new capital conservation buffer requirement was completed. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe table below compares minimum required capital ratios and the well-capitalized minimums to current actual ratios for the Company and the Bank as of December 31, 2019. The well-capitalized standard for the Company is from Regulation Y and the well-capitalized standard for the Bank is from Prompt Corrective Action, or PCA, regulations.\nOur Company faces cyber-security risks, including \u201cdenial-of-service attacks,\u201d \u201chacking,\u201d and \u201cidentity theft\u201d that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, and other means. Denial-of-service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, primarily resulting in inconvenience. Future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm to the Company and the Bank.\nIn addition, we provide our clients with the ability to bank remotely, including online, through their mobile device and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, and other internal and external security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our clients involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other possible liabilities.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nFurther, targeted social engineering attacks may be sophisticated and difficult to prevent and our employees, clients, or other users of our systems may be fraudulently induced to disclose sensitive information, allowing cyber criminals to gain access to our data or data of our clients.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or to those of our clients and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our clients, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nPrivacy, information security and data protection rules regulations could affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, increase our costs, and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including: (i) certain limitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our clients with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requirements for certain disclosures to clients about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford clients the right to \"opt out\" of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requirements that we develop, implement and maintain a written information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of client information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by clients. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements. We maintain a portfolio of investment securities and hold overnight funds that may be used as a secondary source of liquidity to the extent the securities are not pledged for collateral. Other potential sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, the ability to acquire brokered deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the issuance of debt or equity securities, and borrowings through the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window. Without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers.\nAdditionally, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors specific to us, the financial services industry, or the economy in general. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in our local or national economies, difficult or illiquid credit markets, or adverse regulatory actions against us. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material, adverse effect on our regulatory standing, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we anticipate continuing to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities presented to us in our core and other markets. The number of financial institutions headquartered in our geographic market continues to decline through merger and other activity. We expect that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. This competition, as the number of acquisition targets decreases, could increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe may be in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance, including with respect to anti-money laundering obligations, consumer protection laws and CRA obligations, and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity per share of our common stock, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCosts associated with repossessed properties, including environmental remediation, may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties serving as collateral for certain loans. There are significant costs associated with our ownership of these properties including, but not limited to, personnel costs, taxes and insurance, completion and repair costs, and valuation adjustments. Additionally, we may experience unfavorable pricing in connection with our disposition of foreclosed properties. These costs, along with unfavorable pricing upon disposition, may adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf hazardous or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material, adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur systems of internal operating controls may not be effective.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with critical information used to manage our business. These systems are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost, judgments used in decision-making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or processes and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, any system of internal operating controls may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. From time-to-time, control deficiencies and losses from operational malfunctions or fraud have occurred and may occur in the future. Any future deficiencies, weaknesses, or losses related to internal operating control systems could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe Company may experience significant competition from new or existing competitors, which may reduce its client base or cause it to lower prices for its products and services in order to maintain market share.\nThere is intense competition among banks in the Company\u2019s market area. In addition, the Company competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, factoring companies, the mutual funds industry, fin-tech companies, full-service brokerage firms, and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations than us with respect to the products and services they provide. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and client expectations. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services.\nIn addition, the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including Internet banking services, mobile applications, and advanced ATM functionality, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The Company may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, anticipating or reacting to consumers\u2019 changing technological preferences, or developing and maintaining loyal clients. In addition, we could lose market share to the shadow banking system or other non-traditional banking organizations.\nSome of our larger competitors may have greater capital and resources than the Company, may have higher lending limits, and may offer products and services not offered by us. Any potential adverse reactions to our financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit our ability to attract and retain clients and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain clients or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also experiences competition from non-bank companies inside and outside of its market area and, in some cases, from companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants. In particular, technology companies have begun to focus on the financial sector and offer software and products primarily over the internet, with an increasing focus on mobile device delivery. These companies generally are not subject to regulatory requirements comparable to those to which financial institutions are subject, and may accordingly realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the client. For example, a number of companies offer bill pay and funds transfer services that allow clients to avoid using a bank. Technology companies are generally positioned and structured to quickly adapt to technological advances and directly focus resources on implementing those advances. This competition could result in the loss of fee income and client deposits and related income. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and the Company may be unable to develop competitive and timely new products and services in response. As the pace of technology and change advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its business infrastructure.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations and we outsource many of our major systems, such as certain data processing, loan servicing, and deposit processing systems. While the Company has selected these external vendors and systems carefully and continues to manage and oversee these vendors, it does not control their operations. Failure of certain external vendors or systems to perform or provide services in accordance with contractual arrangements could be disruptive to our operations and limit our ability to provide certain products and services demanded by our clients. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience disruptions if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained, or repeated, a system failure or disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability. Any of the failures or disruptions mentioned above could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThere are operational risks that are inherent in our business.\nTo successfully offer our clients the products and services they demand, we must be able to process a large volume of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with federal and state banking laws and regulations. Operational risk and losses can result from a variety of things including internal and external fraud; errors by employees or third parties; failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical, telecommunications, or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system failures, including those caused by computer viruses, cyber-attacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties. Although we have devoted substantial resources to developing efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff, it is not possible to be certain that the risk controls and loss mitigation actions we have implemented have been or will be effective in controlling our operating risks. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability for us to operate our business, additional costs to correct defects, potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe resolution of litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.\nWe face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high. Legal liability against us could have material, adverse financial effects or cause harm to our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our business prospects.\nAdditionally, some of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our clients and others. From time-to-time, third parties may make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability and/or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology enables financial institutions to better serve clients and to perform more efficiently. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy clients\u2019 demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material, adverse impact on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nFinancial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties. For example, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to increased credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client.\nOur business is subject to the risks of certain global conditions, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, and other natural catastrophic events.\nA major catastrophe, such as a pandemic, disease outbreak, or other natural disaster including extreme weather or other events, such as an earthquake, tsunami, flood, fire, winter storms, or other type of natural disaster could adversely affect our financial condition or result in a prolonged interruption of our business. We have operations and clients in the Northwest, a geographical region that has been or may be affected by disease, earthquake, volcano, tsunami, and flooding activity, which could be adversely impacted by these natural disasters or other severe weather in the region. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Company in that such events could materially disrupt our operations or the ability or willingness of our clients to access the financial services offered by the Company. These events could reduce our earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be adversely affected by a world-wide pandemic.\nCertain of our borrowers may be affected by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China but has been reported in other countries. These effects could include disruptions or restrictions in our borrowers\u2019 supply chains, closures of their facilities or decreases in demand for their products and services. If our borrowers are adversely affected, or if the virus leads to a widespread health crisis that impacts economic growth, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, despite having no direct operations in China.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nVolatility in the price and volume of our stock may be unfavorable.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022prevailing market conditions;\n\u2022our historical performance and capital structure;\n\u2022estimates of our business potential and earnings prospects;\n\u2022an overall assessment of our management;\n\u2022conversion by our Class B shareholders of their shares into Class A common stock to liquidate their holdings;\n\u2022our performance relative to our peers;\n\u2022market demand for our shares;\n\u2022perceptions of the banking industry in general;\n\u2022political influences on investor sentiment; and\n\u2022consumer confidence.\nAt times, the stock markets, including the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which our Class A common stock is listed, may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our Class A common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Further, because our Class B common stock is convertible on a share-for-share basis into Class A common stock and the share price of our Class B common stock is based upon the share price of our Class A common stock, our Class B common stock price is similarly impacted by the factors affecting our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur dividend policy, or our ability to pay dividends, may change.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiary Bank. Since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we depend upon dividends from our Bank for a substantial part of our revenue. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends, cover operating expenses, and acquire other institutions depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The ability of our Bank to pay dividends to us is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition, and need for funds, as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and the Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval.\nAlthough we have historically paid dividends to our stockholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The amount of any dividend declaration is subject to our evaluation of our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur Class A and Class B common stock is not a bank savings account or deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or any other public or private entity. As a result, holders of our common stock could lose some or all of their investment.\nHolders of the Class B common stock have voting control of the Company and are able to determine virtually all matters submitted to stockholders, including potential change in control transactions.\nMembers of the Scott family control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Due to their holdings of common stock, members of the Scott family are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our articles of incorporation (except when a class vote is required by law or pursuant to our articles of incorporation), any merger or consolidation requiring common stockholder approval, and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, such holders have the ability to prevent change in control transactions as long as they maintain voting control of the Company.\nIn addition, because these holders have the ability to elect all of our directors, they are able to control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, the payments of dividends on our common stock, and entering into extraordinary transactions; their interests may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of all stockholders. The Scott family members have entered into a stockholder agreement giving family members a right of first refusal to purchase shares of Class B common stock that are intended to be sold or transferred, subject to certain exceptions, by other family members. This agreement may have the effect of continuing ownership of the Class B common stock and control within the Scott family. This concentrated control limits stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders.\nWe are a financial and bank holding company incorporated in the State of Montana. Anti-takeover provisions in Montana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might receive if we are sold.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that our Board may issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, conditions, rights, privileges, and preferences as the Board may deem appropriate. In addition, our articles of incorporation provide for staggered terms for our Board and limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of Montana law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such Class A common stock.\nFurther, the acquisition of specified amounts of our common stock (in some cases, the acquisition or control of more than 5% of our voting stock) may require certain regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve and one or more of our state banking regulatory agencies. The filing of applications with these agencies and the accompanying review process can take several months. Additionally, as discussed above, the holders of the Class B common stock will have voting control of the Company. This and the other factors described above may hinder or even prevent a change in control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nDue to the combined voting power of the members of the Scott family, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are exempt from certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\ndirector nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process.\nOur compensation and governance and nominating committees may not consist entirely of independent directors. As long as we choose to rely on these exemptions from NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, stockholders and other interested parties should be aware, therefore, that decisions concerning executive compensation and director nominations may not be determined solely by the Board\u2019s independent directors and may be adverse to your particular interests.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional Class A common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee equity compensation plans or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. Should we choose to raise capital by selling shares of Class A common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, our Class B common stock is convertible into Class A common stock at any time at the sole discretion of the holders of Class B shares or automatically if, on the record date for any meeting of stockholders, the number of outstanding Class B shares constitutes less than 20% of the aggregate number of common stock then outstanding.\nThe common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our Class A and Class B common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our Class A and Class B common stock rank junior to all our indebtedness, including any subordinated term loans, subordinated debentures held by trusts that have issued trust-preferred securities, and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us. In the future, we may make additional offerings of debt or equity securities or we may issue additional debt or equity securities as consideration for future mergers and acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 93304, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FIBK"}
