{"cik": "1142596", "company": "NUVASIVE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are set forth below and elsewhere in this report. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Under these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report before you decide to invest in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince spine surgeons that our minimally disruptive surgical products are an attractive alternative to our competitors\u2019 products for the treatment of spine disorders.\nAcceptance of our products by spine surgeons depends on educating and training spine surgeons as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our minimally-disruptive surgical products as compared to our competitors\u2019 products. Surgeons may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u00b7\nlack of experience with minimally disruptive surgical products and procedures;\n\u00b7\nlack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;\n\u00b7\nperceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u00b7\nlimited or lack of availability of coverage and reimbursement within healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7\nincreased competition in lateral procedural offerings;\n\u00b7\nlack of perceived differentiation among lateral procedures;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with the purchase of new products and equipment; and\n\u00b7\nthe time commitment that may be required for training.\nIf we are not successful in convincing spine surgeons of the merit of our minimally disruptive surgical products, educating them on the use of our products and maintaining their support in the use of our minimally disruptive surgical products, we will be unable to increase our sales and sustain our growth and profitability. Subsequently, if we fail to adequately and continually promote and market our products to spine surgeons or if spine surgeons adopt competing products into their practice, our sales could significantly decrease which could significantly impact our profitability and cash flow.\nAdditionally, we compete with companies throughout the world, many of which have developed or plan to develop competing products for use in minimally-disruptive surgical spine procedures. Several of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, and they may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, these competitors may have significantly greater operating history and patent portfolios than we do in their respective fields. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate reimbursement and are safer, less invasive and less expensive than alternatives available for the same purpose. Because of the significant size of the potential market, we anticipate that companies will continue to dedicate significant resources to developing competing products.\nOur future success depends on our strategy of obsoleting our own products and our ability to timely acquire, develop and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market.\nWe have the objective of staying ahead of the spine market by obsoleting our own products with new technologies. It is important to our business that we continue to build upon our product offering to surgeons and hospitals, and enhance the products we currently offer. As such, our success will depend in part on our ability to acquire, develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products to keep pace with the rapidly changing spine market. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire, develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market new products or that any of our future products or enhancements will be accepted by the surgeons who use our products or the third-party payers who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products. Additionally, in our quest to obsolete our own products, we must effectively manage our inventory, the demand for new and current products and the regulatory process for new products in order to avoid unintended adverse financial and accounting consequences. Additionally, the research and development of many of our new and improved products is vetted by the health care professionals we maintain relationships with. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience in this regard. If we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development of our products could suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we do not effectively manage our strategy of obsoleting our own products by acquiring or developing new products or product enhancements that we can introduce in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, or if we do not manage the product transitions well which would result in margin reducing write-offs for obsolete inventory, our results of operations may suffer.\nChanges to third-party reimbursement policies and practices, including non-coverage decisions, can negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services.\nSales of our products and services depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. We believe that future third-party reimbursement for health care costs may be subject to changes in policies and practices, such as more restrictive criteria to qualify for surgery coverage or reduction in payment amounts to hospitals and surgeons for approved surgery and intraoperative monitoring, both in the United States and internationally. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. Future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers may adversely affect the demand for our products and services as healthcare providers (such as hospitals that purchase medical devices and services for treatment of their patients) generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices and services. Likewise, spine surgeons, neurophysiologists and their supervising physicians rely primarily on third-party reimbursement for the surgical or monitoring fees they earn. Spine surgeons are unlikely to use our products and services if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in surgical procedures.\nCertain third-party payers have stated non-coverage decisions concerning our technologies and services and implementation of such decisions could significantly alter our ability to sell our products.\nAdditionally, there is downward pressure on reimbursement for the IOM services provided by Impulse Monitoring. Significant coding changes for IOM services took effect in 2013. New Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were introduced in 2013 that have led to reduced reimbursement by private payers for the professional remote oversight component of the service. Medicare patients were also subject to additional coding changes imposed by CMS which may restrict access to care and limit Impulse Monitoring\u2019s ability to cover, bill and collect for cases performed.\nAs we sell our products internationally, market acceptance may depend, in part, upon the availability of reimbursement within respective healthcare payment systems in the markets we compete in. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. The volatilities in these international reimbursement and healthcare payment systems can have a material effect on our ability to achieve financial guidance and our results of operations.\nPricing pressure from our competitors, hospital customers and insurance providers can negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services.\nThe market for spine surgery products is large and this has attracted numerous new companies and technologies, and encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pressure. New entrants to our markets include numerous niche companies with singular product focus, as well as companies owned partially by spine surgeons (physician-owned distributorships or PODs). PODs can have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products. We believe there will be continued pricing pressure as a result of this increased competition. In addition, we may experience decreasing prices for our products due to pricing pressure experienced by our hospital customers from managed care organizations, insurance providers and other third-party payers and increased market power of our hospital customers as the medical device industry consolidates.\nIf competitive forces drive down the price we are able to charge for some of our products, and we are not able to counter that pressure as we have historically with the rapid introduction of new offerings, our profit margins will shrink, which will hinder our ability to generate profits and cash flow, and, as a result, to invest in and grow our business, including the investment into new and innovative technologies.\nHealth care policy changes, including United States health care reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn recent years, in response to perceived increases in health care costs, there have been and continue to be proposals by the United States federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control costs and generally reform the United States health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the acceptance and availability of our products and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. Certain provisions of the law will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established, and it is unclear what the full impacts on us will be from the law. The legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3 percent excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales, which commenced in January 2013. Under the new legislation, the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately $20 billion over the first 10 years of such tax. We continue to expect the tax will have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The law also focuses on a number of Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs. It is uncertain what negative unintended consequences these provisions may have on patient access to new technologies. The Medicare provisions include value-based payment programs, increased funding of comparative effectiveness research, reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination (such as bundled physician and hospital payments). Additionally, the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for Medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending. We cannot predict what health care programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the United States federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation may have on us. Any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure frequency adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are in a highly competitive market segment that is subject to rapid change and face competition from large, well-established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants.\nThe market for spine surgery products and procedures is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. With respect to our nerve monitoring systems and IOM services, we compete with Medtronic and VIASYS Healthcare, a division of CareFusion Corporation, which has announced it is being acquired by Becton Dickinson and Company, each of which have significantly greater resources than we do, as well as numerous regional nerve monitoring companies. With respect to MaXcess, our minimally-disruptive surgical system, our largest competitors are Medtronic, DePuy/Synthes, Stryker Spine, Globus Medical, and Zimmer Spine. We compete with many of the same companies with respect to our other products. We also compete with numerous smaller companies with respect to our implant products, many of whom have a significant regional market presence. At any time, these companies may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products.\nMany of our larger competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies, and enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u00b7\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u00b7\nestablished relations with a greater number of spine surgeons, hospitals, other healthcare providers and third-party payers;\n\u00b7\nlarger and more well established distribution networks domestically and/or internationally;\n\u00b7\nproducts supported by long-term clinical data;\n\u00b7\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory approvals or clearances for products and product enhancements;\n\u00b7\nmore expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights and greater funds available to engage in legal action; and\n\u00b7\ngreater financial assets, cash flow, capital markets access and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing, and litigation.\nIn addition, the spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new market entrants, including PODs. Many of these new competitors focus on a specific product or market segment, making it more difficult for us to expand our overall market position. If these companies are continually successful, we expect that competition will become even more intense, leading to greater pricing pressure and making it more difficult for us to expand.\nThe proliferation of physician-owned distributorships, as well as aggressive competitive tactics to attract away key customers, could result in increased pricing pressure on our products and harm our ability to maintain or grow revenues.\nPODs are medical device distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. These physicians derive revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical devices via their POD that are used in the procedures they perform on their patients. We do not sell or distribute any of our products to PODs. However, the prevalence of PODs may reduce our market opportunities and may hamper our ability to grow or maintain revenues. In addition, we have seen increasingly aggressive competitive tactics from PODs focused on attracting customers away from us. To the extent these tactics are successful, our revenues may materially suffer.\nIf our acquisitions are unsuccessful, our business may be harmed.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, companies, technologies, and product lines to maintain our objectives of developing or acquiring innovative technologies and expanding our capabilities, increasing revenues, and widening our footprint. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition, which could result in future non-cash impairment charges and/or a dilution of future earnings per share;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integration of the operations, technologies, personnel, and products of the acquired companies, which may require significant attention of the Company\u2019s management team that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business;\n\u00b7\nthe applicability of additional laws, regulations and policies that have particular application to our acquisitions, including those relating to patient privacy, insurance fraud and abuse, false claims, prohibitions against self-referrals, anti-kickbacks, direct billing practices, HIPAA compliance, and prohibitions against the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in retaining key relationships with shareowners (employees), customers, partners and suppliers of the acquired company; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in operating in different business markets where we may not have historical experience.\nAny of these factors could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or financial position. Further, past and potential acquisitions entail risks, uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business, especially where we have limited experience as a company developing or marketing a particular product or technology. For example, we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s operations, business processes, technologies, products and services, information systems and personnel into our business. Acquisitions may also further strain our existing financial and managerial controls, and divert the Company\u2019s management team\u2019s attention away from our other business concerns.\nOur IOM business exposes us to risks inherent with the sale of services.\nWe sell IOM services that are unique from the sale of our biologics, lumbar, thoracic, cervical and motion preservation products and have applications outside of our core business of spinal surgery. Our IOM services involve neurophysiologists who oversee and interpret neurophysiological data gathered via broadband transmission in real-time being located in the operating room and working in partnership with supervising physicians. Providing this service subjects us to malpractice exposure.\nAdditionally, our ability to deliver our IOM services could be severely affected if we fail to manage our relationships with the supervising physicians and the hospital customers. Any disruption to our technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm our service operations and our reputation among our customers. Any disruption to our computer systems could adversely impact the performance of our neurophysiologists.\nOur Impulse Monitoring business also engages in direct billing of Medicare and commercial payers for IOM service which brings with it additional risks associated with proper billing practice regulations, HIPAA compliance, corporate practice of medicine laws, and new collections risk associated with third-party payers.\nDue to the breadth of many healthcare laws and regulations, our IOM business could also be subject to healthcare fraud regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which bill federal healthcare programs, and/or (iii) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert Management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain and expand our network of direct and independent sales representatives, we may not be able to generate anticipated sales.\nIn the United States, we sell our products through a combination of exclusive independent sales agencies and directly-employed sales shareowners (employees). Our international sales force is comprised of directly-employed sales shareowners as well as exclusive distributors and independent sales agents. We expect these sales representatives to develop long-lasting relationships with the spine surgeons they serve. If our sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales could significantly decrease.\nWe face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the individuals who make up that network. For example, in 2012 and 2013, we experienced an increase in sales representatives leaving us (with year-over-year departures holding flat in 2014). If any additional sales representatives were to leave us, our sales could be adversely affected. If sales representatives were to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent them from helping competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect our sales. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to recruit or retain sales representatives to work with us. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales representatives would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales.\nIf we are unable to recruit, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel, our ability to effectively manage and expand our business will be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on attracting, motivating and retaining executive talent and other key shareowners. Specifically, our performance depends in part on the continued services of many of our current shareowners including members of management and other key personnel who may terminate their employment at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is significant. The loss of any of our senior management team could harm our business and the announcement of the loss of one of our key employees could negatively affect our stock price. Our ability to retain our skilled workforce and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future. We face challenges in hiring, training, managing and retaining employees in certain areas including clinical, technical, sales and marketing. This could delay new product development and commercialization and hinder our marketing and sales efforts, which would adversely impact our competitiveness and financial results.\nSales to customers outside the United States have accounted for a large portion of our revenues, which exposes us to risks inherent in international sales.\nAs a key component of our business strategy to develop new markets, we intend to continue to expand our international sales, but success cannot be assured. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and we are subject to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly affect us include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and anti-boycott laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations in the United States or abroad could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities. Any reduction in international sales, or our failure to further develop our international markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, as we increasingly compete in markets outside of the United States, we are and will be exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations. A significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. If the U.S. dollar weakens, our consolidated operating expenses would increase. Should the U.S. dollar strengthen, our products may become more expensive for our international customers, and as a result, our results of operations and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected, especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales. Accordingly, fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the pound sterling the euro, the Australian dollar and the yen, could adversely affect our financial results, including our revenues, revenue growth rates, gross margins, income and losses as well as assets and liabilities.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated international growth, our business could suffer.\nWe have invested, and expect to increase our investment for the foreseeable future, in our expansion into international markets. To execute our anticipated growth in international markets we must:\n\u00b7\nmanage the complexities associated with a larger, faster growing and more geographically diverse organization;\n\u00b7\nexpand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly global, larger and more complex clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nmanage our directly-employed sales shareowners as well as distributors and independent sales agents operating in international markets often pursuant to laws, regulations and customs that may be different than those that are customary for our United States operations;\n\u00b7\nexpand our sales and marketing presence in international markets generally to avoid revenue concentration in a small number of markets that would subject us to the risk of business disruption as a result of economic or political problems in concentrated locations;\n\u00b7\nupgrade our internal business processes and capabilities (e.g., information technology platform and systems, product distribution and tracking) to create the scalability and properly handle the transaction volumes that our growing geographically diverse organization demands; and\n\u00b7\nexpend time and resources to receive product approvals and clearances to sell and promote products.\nWe expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand into international markets. International markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our products and are expected, in many instances, to yield lower profit margins when compared to our domestic operations. We have only limited experience in expanding into international markets as well as marketing and operating our products and services in such markets.\nAdditionally, our international endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of Company management from domestic operations, insufficient revenue to offset the expenses associated with our international strategy, and issues not discovered in our due diligence of new markets or ventures. Because expansion into international markets is inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Even if our international expansion is successful, our expenses may increase at a greater pace than our revenues and our operating results could be harmed.\nFurther, our anticipated growth internationally will place additional strain on our suppliers and manufacturers, resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor quality assurance. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nOur reliance on single source suppliers and manufacturers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to supply and manufacture a majority of our products. To be successful, our contract manufacturers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable cost and on a timely basis. Among other factors, our anticipated growth could strain the ability of suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of products, materials and components. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet customer demand on a timely basis, we could lose customers, our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer.\nWe currently use one or two manufacturers (respectively) for many of our devices, biologics, and components. Our dependence on one or two manufacturers for each such product line involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. If any one or more of our manufacturers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality or cease to do business in general, we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing. We could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage alternative suppliers on favorable terms. Any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. In the event we experience delays, shortages, or stoppages of supply with any supplier, we would be forced to locate a suitable alternative supplier which could take significant time and result in significant expense. Any inability to meet our customers\u2019 demands for these products could lead to decreased sales and harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers to our competitors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nManufacturing risks may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results.\nIn May 2013, we acquired a spine implant manufacturer based in Dayton, Ohio and currently manufacture a portion of our products at this facility. As part of our business strategy, we intend to expand our ability to manufacture our current and new products with exceptional quality and in sufficient quantities to meet demand, while complying with regulatory requirements and managing manufacturing costs. We are subject to numerous risks relating to our manufacturing capabilities, including both those of our owned manufacturing facilities and those of our third party suppliers, such as:\n\u00b7\ndefects in product components that we source from third-party suppliers;\n\u00b7\nfailing to increase production of products to meet demand;\n\u00b7\npotential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current third-party suppliers as we expand our in-house manufacturing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining control over manufacturing expenses as production expands;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to modify production lines to enable the efficient manufacture of new products or to quickly implement changes to current products in response to regulatory requirements; and\n\u00b7\npotential damage to or destruction of our, or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing equipment or manufacturing facilities.\nThese risks may be exacerbated by our limited experience with in-house manufacturing processes and procedures. In addition, as we seek to expand our manufacturing capabilities, we will have to continue to invest additional resources to hire and train personnel and enhance our production processes. If we fail to increase our manufacturing capacity efficiently, our profit margins will shrink, which will negatively affect our operating results.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could result in harm to our business and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to operate and manage our business. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. Our business therefore depends on the continuous, effective, reliable, and secure operation of our computer hardware, software, networks, Internet servers, and related infrastructure. To the extent that our hardware or software malfunctions or access to our data by internal personnel, suppliers or customers through the Internet is interrupted or compromised, our business could suffer.\nThe integrity and protection of our customer, employee, financial, research and development, and other confidential data is critical to our business and our customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Although our computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to system malfunction, computer viruses, and cyber-attacks. These events could lead to the unauthorized access of our information technology systems and result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us, our employees, partners, customers, or our suppliers. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our information technology systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions and we could lose trade secrets or other confidential information, the occurrence of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Litigation\nWe are currently involved in patent litigation involving Medtronic, and, if we do not prevail in the litigation and/or on our appeal of the Medtronic verdict in phase one of the litigation, we could be liable for substantial damages and might be prevented from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or exporting certain of our products.\nOn August 18, 2008, Medtronic filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe, or contribute to the infringement of, U.S. patents owned by Medtronic. Trial in the first phase of the case began in August 2011, and in September 2011, a jury delivered an unfavorable verdict against us with respect to three Medtronic patents and a favorable verdict with respect to one of our patents. The jury awarded monetary damages of approximately $0.7 million to us which includes back royalty payments. Additionally, the jury awarded monetary damages of approximately $101.2 million to Medtronic which includes lost profits and back royalties. On June 11, 2013, the District Court determined that the amount of ongoing royalties owed by us to Medtronic was 13.75% on certain of NuVasive\u2019s CoRoent XL implants and 8.25% on certain of NuVasive\u2019s MaXcess III retractors and related products. On August 20, 2013, NuVasive and Medtronic filed their respective notices of appeal, and the appeal is now proceeding before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We entered into an escrow arrangement in 2012 and transferred $113.3 million of cash into a restricted escrow account to secure the amount of judgment, plus prejudgment interest, during pendency of appeal. As a result of the June 2013 ruling, we will be required to escrow funds to secure accrued royalties, estimated at $29.4 million to date, as well as future ongoing royalties, plus prejudgment interest, which represents a material reduction in our cash resources available for investment.\nIn August 2012, Medtronic filed additional patent claims (Phase 3) against us alleging that various NuVasive spinal implants (including our CoRoent XL family of spinal implants) and NuVasive\u2019s Osteocel Plus bone graft product, along with the XLIF procedure, infringe Medtronic patents not asserted in prior phases of the case. We deny infringing any valid claims of these additional patents and on March 7, 2013, we filed counterclaims against Medtronic asserting that Medtronic\u2019s MAST Quadrant retractor system, the NIM-Eclipse Spinal System, the Clydesdale Spinal System, the Capstone-L products, and the Direct Lateral Interbody Fusion (\u201cDLIF\u201d) procedure infringe eight NuVasive patents. No trial date has been set.\nIf we do not prevail in the Medtronic litigation we could be required to stop selling certain of our products, pay substantial monetary amounts as damages, and/or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements. Such adverse results may limit our ability to generate profits and cash flow, and, as a consequence, to invest in and grow our business, including investments into new and innovative technologies.\nWe are currently involved in a trademark litigation action involving the NeuroVision brand name and, if we do not prevail, we could be liable for substantial damages.\nOn September 25, 2009, Neurovision Medical Products, Inc. (NMP) filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. NMP sought cancellation of our \u201cNeuroVision\u201d trademark registrations, injunctive relief and damages based on NMP\u2019s common law use of the \u201cNeuroVision\u201d mark. Trial of the matter took place in October 2010, and an unfavorable jury verdict was delivered against us relating to our use of the NeuroVision trade name in the amount of $60.0 million plus attorney fees and costs, as well as an injunction. We promptly appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. During the pendency of the appeal, we were required to escrow the amount of the judgment, plus interest. In September 2012, the Court of Appeals reversed and vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment against us, and also reversed and vacated the injunction and the award of attorney fees and costs. The Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial and instructed the District Court to assign the case to a different judge. In December 2012, the full $62.5 million was released from escrow and returned to us. Retrial of the matter began on March 25, 2014, and on April 3, 2014, a jury returned a verdict in favor of NMP on its claims against us in the amount of $30.0 million. The Court affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict, and on September 4, 2014, we filed a notice of appeal. The Court entered a permanent injunction on September 24, 2014, enjoining our future use of the NeuroVision trademark to market or promote our products. The Court also entered an order canceling our NeuroVision trademark registrations, but that order is stayed pending the appeal process. On December 2, 2014, the Court denied NMP\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and prejudgment interest, and NMP filed a notice of appeal on December 17, 2014. The appeals were consolidated on February 2, 2015, and resolution of the appeals may take up to two years. During pendency of the appeal, we have agreed to escrow funds totaling $32.5 million to secure the amount of judgment, plus interest, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\nThis litigation process has been expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. We may also be subject to additional negative publicity due to this trademark litigation. This litigation may significantly divert the attention of our technical and Management personnel. In the event that we are unsuccessful in our defense, we could be required to pay significant damages which are not covered under any of our insurance plans. In the event this outcome occurs, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert Management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are currently defending a purported securities class action lawsuit which alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and seeks unspecified monetary relief, interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees. At December 31, 2014, the probable outcome of this litigation cannot be determined, nor can the Company estimate a range of potential loss. We may be the target of this type of litigation again in the future. Any securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our Management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe are currently involved in several additional litigation actions which could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and/or prevent us from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or exporting certain of our products.\nIntellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. A court could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us or our customers from modeling, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our current or future products, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. We may also be subject to negative publicity due to litigation. Pending or future patent litigation against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property, unless we develop alternative non-infringing technology or that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property, and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, or if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all, and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us. Even if any strategic partners, licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third-party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Furthermore, if we are found to infringe patent claims of a third-party, we may, among other things, be required to pay damages, including up to treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, which may be substantial.\nAn unfavorable outcome for us in patent or other intellectual property litigation could significantly harm our business if such outcome makes us unable to commercialize some of our current or potential products or cease some of our business operations. In addition, costs of prosecution of claims and defense, and any damages resulting from litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Litigation may also harm our relationships with existing customers and subject us to negative publicity, each of which could harm our business and financial results.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. For example, our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents at all or not in a form that will be advantageous to us or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes which are comparable to ours. Moreover, competitors may challenge our issued patents through post-grant challenge procedures (domestically) and/or opposition proceedings (internationally). On March 16, 2012, the America Invents Act amended the post-grant challenge procedures in the U.S. to eliminate inter partes reexamination, maintain ex parte reexamination, and add inter partes review and supplemental examination. Both Medtronic and Globus filed inter partes reexamination requests (before March 16, 2012) against the patents we asserted against them. Those inter partes reexamination requests were granted and those proceedings are in progress. Medtronic filed multiple inter partes review petitions (after March 16, 2012) against the patents we asserted against them in phase 3. Those inter partes review petitions have not yet been decided. If the U.S. Patent Office ultimately cancels or narrows the claims in any of our patents through these proceedings, it could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce them against competitors.\nAlthough we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers, shareowners, consultants and advisors, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. To the extent that our shareowners, consultants, or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nIn addition, recently enacted changes to the U.S. patent laws, together with proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent Office to comport with the newly enacted laws may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. Of significance in the newly enacted patent laws, the United States has shifted from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system, which went into effect on March 16, 2013. Consequently, the pool of prior art available to inhibit or limit our ability to obtain issued patents on the technology utilized in our products is expected to expand and the grace period for filing a patent application has been reduced in some ways. It is now possible for a situation to arise in which a competitor is able to obtain patent rights to technology which we invented first. Furthermore, the newly enacted patent laws have expanded the types of post grant challenges of issued patents and these proceedings may provide our competitors with additional opportunities to challenge the validity of our issued patents.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. It is not unusual for parties to exchange letters surrounding allegations of intellectual property infringement and licensing arrangements. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages in some cases. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of Management and key personnel from our business operations. Our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. If our products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, our competitors may independently develop technologies similar to ours. Because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nAs the number of entrants into our market increases, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows. While we make an effort to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties\u2019 rights, our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors. In addition, our competitors may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents.\nA patent infringement suit brought against us or any of our strategic partners or licensees may force us or such strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property, unless that party grants us or our strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all, and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us. Even if our strategic partners, licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third-party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to rigorous governmental regulations regarding the development, manufacture, and sale of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that satisfy these regulations. In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover, among other things, the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, manufacturing, packaging, marketing and distribution of our products.\nWe are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer and tissue bank. As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR) and Good Tissue Practices requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices and tissue banks to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by Notified Bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, ISO or other applicable regulations and standards, product production could be delayed and/or fines could be incurred, regulatory clearances and approvals might be challenged or difficult to obtain, recalls or other consequences might be incurred, any or all of which - in turn - could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nMost medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of such post-marketing programs. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting Regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, that could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects. At any time after approval of a product, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both QSR requirements and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations. Product clearances or approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance or approval.\nPursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. We market our products and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of our products. Although we believe our marketing, promotional materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute promotion of unapproved uses of our products, if it is determined that our marketing, promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of unapproved uses, we could be subject to significant fines in addition to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure and criminal penalty.\nAdditional laws that may affect our ability to operate include: (i) the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, (ii) federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers, and/or (iii) state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from their federal counterparts in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert Management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nAlso, the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to the criminal statute NOTA and state rules and regulations which govern, among other things, payments we make to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors. Failure to comply with such laws could result in enforcement action against us and a disruption to these product lines (and the revenues associated therewith).\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the presence in a company\u2019s products of certain metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d: tantalum, tin, tungsten (or their ores), and gold; which are metals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Under the rules, we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2013 calendar year, we were unable to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from all of our suppliers and were unable to determine that all of our products are conflict free. We may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.\nWhenever the United States or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, such governmental authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and can recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute. Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection or investigation could divert substantial Management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, we received a federal administrative subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) in connection with an investigation into possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. The subpoena seeks discovery of documents for the period January 2007 through April 2013. We cannot control the pace or scope of any investigation, and responding to the subpoena requests and any investigation requires an allocation of resources, including Management time and attention. If we were to become the subject of an enforcement action, including any action resulting from the investigation by the OIG, it could result in negative publicity, penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may fail to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory approvals to market our products in other countries.\nWe currently market our products internationally and intend to expand our international marketing. International jurisdictions require separate regulatory approvals and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary among countries and may involve requirements for additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from country to country and from that required to obtain FDA clearance or approval.\nClearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval or certification process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or certifications and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we fail to receive necessary approvals or certifications to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer.\nOur medical devices are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application (PMA). If clinical trials of our current or future product candidates do not produce results necessary to support regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. Additionally, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. More recently, in July 2012, President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. Among other things, FDASIA includes several reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. One of these provisions obligates the FDA to prepare a report for Congress on the FDA\u2019s approach for determining when a new 510(k) will be required for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. After submitting this report, the FDA is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination. Until receiving such revised guidance, manufacturers may continue to adhere to the FDA\u2019s 1997 guidance on this topic when making a determination as to whether or not a new 510(k) is required for a change or modification to a device, but the practical impact of the FDA\u2019s continuing scrutiny of these issues remains unclear.\nOur failure to comply with such regulations could lead to the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, or product seizures. In the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible.\nPursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials, or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities. Additionally, surgeons use several of our products for unapproved uses. While surgeons are permitted by the FDA to use our products for unapproved uses, there is a heightened risk of an enforcement action against us by a governmental enforcement authority when surgeons engage in this practice.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products in foreign countries, we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future. In such circumstances, we would rely significantly on our foreign subsidiaries and independent sales agencies to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries.\nThe safety of many of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data and many of our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought which could subject us to product liability claims.\nWe obtained clearance to offer almost all of our medical device products that require FDA clearance through the FDA\u2019s 510(k) premarket notification clearance process. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) process, much like other foreign premarket regulatory review processes to which our devices are subject, seldom requires clinical data. As a result, we currently lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of many of our products, devices and tissue that might have been generated in connection with a U.S. PMA-like application. For these reasons, spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. Further, future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes. Such results would reduce demand for our products, affect our ability to have sustainable reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from sustaining or increasing profitability. Moreover, if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation. The spine medical device market has been particularly prone to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices and products for spine surgery procedures.\nA product liability or other damages claim, product recall or product misuse, regardless of the ultimate outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages or costs and could seriously harm our business. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future. In addition, if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves which may harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of our products cause tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. Finally, even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business. A product liability or other damages claim, product recall, or product misuse involving any of our products could also materially and adversely damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract and retain customers, regardless of whether or not the claim or recall had merit.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations or equivalent regulations and standards internationally, the manufacture and processing of our products could be delayed and we may be subject to an enforcement action by the FDA or other government agencies.\nWe and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations, and other applicable standards and requirements, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production or processing, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA and other regulatory bodies enforce compliance with regulatory requirements and standards through periodic inspections. If we or one of our suppliers fail an inspection or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient, the release of our products could be delayed. We have undergone FDA and other regulatory body\u2019s inspections regarding our allograft business and FDA inspections regarding our medical device activities. In connection with these inspections as well as prior inspections, regulatory agencies have requested minor corrective actions, which we have implemented. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not subject us to further enforcement action and the FDA and other regulatory agencies may impose additional inspections at any time.\nAdditionally, we are the legal manufacturer of record for the products that are distributed and labeled by NuVasive, regardless of whether the products are manufactured by us or our suppliers. Thus, a failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action against us by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7\nfines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u00b7\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u00b7\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecution.\nWe or our suppliers may be the subject of claims for non-compliance with FDA regulations in connection with the processing or distribution of allograft products.\nIt is possible that allegations may be made against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks, including those with which we have a contractual relationship, claiming that the acquisition or processing of tissue for allograft products does not comply with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action against us, or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry in general. These actions or any negative publicity could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the attention of Management from our business, harm our reputation and cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nFailure to comply with highly regulated and frequently changing healthcare laws could adversely affect our ability to receive reimbursement for our services and subject us and our officers and agents to civil and criminal penalties.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in laws and regulations can be significant. The federal government and all states and countries in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business. Changes in the law or new interpretation of existing laws can have a material effect on our permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payers. Failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our ability to receive reimbursement for our services and subject us and our officers and agents to civil and criminal penalties.\nAny claims relating to our making improper payments or providing improper gifts or benefits to physicians or other potential violations of laws or regulations governing interactions between us and healthcare professionals and our involvement in federal healthcare programs could be time consuming and costly.\nOur relationship with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those that may market our products (e.g., distributors, etc.), are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws, rules and regulations (e.g., anti-kickback statute, self-referral/Stark laws, false claims, etc.), often referred to collectively as \u201chealthcare fraud and abuse laws\u201d. These laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. Despite implementation of a comprehensive global healthcare compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely affects our business activities or relationships with healthcare professionals, nor can we make any assurances that authorities will not challenge or investigate our current or future activities under these laws.\nIn recent years, both the United States and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased United States government oversight and enforcement of the FCPA. Despite implementation of a comprehensive global healthcare compliance program, we may be subject to more regulation, enforcement, inspections and investigations by governmental authorities in the future. Whenever the United States or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, such governmental authority can - among other options available to them - impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, exclude or debar us from federal healthcare programs, impose compliance obligations, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and can recommend criminal prosecution to the DOJ. Any of the foregoing (or other possible) actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. We market our products and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of our products. Although we believe our marketing, promotional materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute promotion of unapproved uses of our products, if it is determined that our marketing, promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of unapproved uses, we could be subject to significant fines in addition to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure and criminal penalty.\nIn addition to the possible sanctions described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection or investigation could divert substantial attention of the Company\u2019s management team from the operation of our business, as well as could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor example, during the second quarter of 2013, we received a federal administrative subpoena from the OIG in connection with an investigation into possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. Responding to the subpoena requests and investigation has required - and will, until resolved, continue to require - an allocation of resources, including the time and attention of the Company\u2019s management team. Furthermore, if we were to become the subject of an enforcement action, including any action resulting from the investigation by the OIG, it could result in negative publicity, penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we must comply with a variety of other laws, such as the (i) HIPAA and the HITECH Act which protects the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information, (ii) the Physician Payment Sunshine Act which requires medical device companies to begin reporting all compensation, gifts and benefits provided to certain healthcare professionals in 2013, and (iii) the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections.\nOur international operations expose us to legal and regulatory risks, which could have a material effect on our business.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant Management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.\nFurthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the United States, including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. A determination that we have failed to comply, whether knowingly or inadvertently, may result in substantial penalties, including fines and enforcement actions and civil and/or criminal sanctions, the disgorgement of profits and the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, as well as the denial of export privileges, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations and financial condition generally.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nWe may be unable to grow our revenue or earnings as anticipated, which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe have experienced rapid growth since our inception, and have increased our revenues from $38.4 million in 2004, the year of our initial public offering, to approximately $762.4 million in 2014. Our ability to achieve future growth will depend upon, among other things, the success of our growth strategies, which we cannot assure will be successful. In addition, we may have more difficulty maintaining our prior rate of growth of revenues or recent levels of profitability and cash flow. Our future success will depend upon various factors, including the strength of our brand image, the market success of our current and future products, competitive conditions and our ability to manage increased revenues, if any, or implement our growth strategy. In addition, we anticipate significantly expanding our infrastructure and adding personnel in connection with our anticipated growth, which we expect will cause our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. Because these expenses are generally fixed, particularly in the short-to-medium term, our operating and financial results may be adversely impacted if we do not achieve our anticipated growth.\nFuture deterioration or prolonged difficulty in worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and the liquidity of our customers.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $405.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. Additionally, as of that date, we had approximately $123.2 million of cash in restricted accounts, and may have additional, material restricted or escrow account obligations upcoming. Such arrangements meaningfully reduce the liquidity available to run or grow our business.\nWe have historically invested our cash primarily in U.S. government sponsored entities and U.S. treasuries, corporate debt, and money market funds. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity and other market risks. The general condition of the financial markets and the economy may exacerbate these risks and may affect the value of our current investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets or even our own funds.\nThe liquidity of our customers and suppliers may also be affected by adverse global economic conditions. The economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 and the related worldwide financial industry turmoil caused extreme disruption in the financial markets, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. Although these conditions have improved, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. If our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems, important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected. If our customers\u2019 liquidity and creditworthiness is negatively impacted by the condition of the economy, our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and our collection cycles may be adversely affected.\nThe sale of our 2.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017 significantly increased our amount of long-term debt, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not efficiently manage our liabilities.\nIn June 2011, we issued $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% Senior Convertible Notes due in 2017 (the 2017 Notes). As a result of the sale of the 2017 Notes, we have a substantial amount of long-term debt. Our maintenance of such debt could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there are a large number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the potential conversion of our 2017 Notes and our Series A Preferred Stock that may be available for future sale and the sale of these shares may depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption, evolution or change of new and/or amended U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and the Netherlands, where a number of our subsidiaries are (or were) located. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate our worldwide tax liabilities. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective income tax rates have recently been, and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, by stock-based compensation and other non-deductible expenses, by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nDuring 2013, we began work on a globalization initiative which became effective in January 2014. The initiative involved establishing new international operations and entering into new intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, including the licensing of intangibles. We intend to continue to streamline our international operations to better align with and support our international business activities and markets through changes in how we develop, license and use our intangible property and how we structure our international procurement and customer service functions. We anticipate a negative impact to our effective tax rate over the next several years while achieving an overall reduction to our effective tax rate over the longer term. There can be no assurance that the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate or will operate or to which we are otherwise deemed to have sufficient tax presence will not challenge the tax benefits that we ultimately expect to realize as a result of implementing the new structure. In addition, future changes to U.S. or non-U.S. tax laws, including proposed legislation to reform the U.S. taxation of international business, could negatively impact the anticipated tax benefits of the proposed new structure. Any long term benefits to our tax rate will also depend on our ability to achieve our anticipated international growth projections and to operate our business in a manner consistent with the new structure. If we do not operate our business consistent with the new structure and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the financial efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the new structure and our future operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nFinally, we may be subject in the future to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities which may result in the assessment of additional income taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., Ireland, or the Netherlands or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially, potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. For example, the closing price for our stock on the last day of the past four quarters was: $47.16 on December 31, 2014, $34.87 on September 30, 2014, $35.57 on June 30, 2014 and $38.41 on March 31, 2014. Fluctuation in the stock price may occur due to many factors, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and other factors related to the economy or otherwise, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors. These conditions might include people\u2019s expectations, favorable or unfavorable, as to the likely unit growth of the spine sector;\n\u00b7\nnegative stock market reactions to the results of litigation;\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity regarding spine surgeon\u2019s practices or outcomes, whether warranted or not, that cast the sector in a negative light;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the availability of third-party reimbursement in the United States or other countries;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our or our competitor\u2019s results of operations;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers and directors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals, clearances or applications;\n\u00b7\nthe acquisition or divestiture of businesses, products, assets or technology by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nlitigation (including intellectual property litigation) and any associated negative verdicts or ruling;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of actions by the FDA or other regulatory agencies; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings or operating margin estimates or recommendations by us or by securities analysts.\n\u00b7\nMarket price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current Management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u00b7\nprovide for a classified board of directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our stockholders may remove our directors only for cause;\n\u00b7\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent;\n\u00b7\nprohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with 66 2/3% stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 90188, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NUVA"}
