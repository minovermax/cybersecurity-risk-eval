The following list, which contains certain risks that may be unique to the Corporation and to the banking industry, is neither all-inclusive nor are the factors in any particular order.\nRisks Related to the Pandemic\nThe recent global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities and other markets and could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since then, COVID-19 infections have spread to additional countries including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our business, and there is no guarantee that our efforts to address or mitigate the adverse impacts of the coronavirus will be effective. The impact to date has included periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities and other markets. This volatility, if it continues, could have an adverse impact on our customers and on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as our growth strategy.\nOur business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. The spread of COVID-19 has caused and could continue to cause severe disruptions in the U.S. economy at large, and has resulted and may continue to result in disruptions to our customers\u2019 businesses, and a decrease in consumer confidence and business generally. In addition, actions by US federal, state and local governments to address the pandemic, including travel bans, stay-at-home orders and school, business and entertainment venue closures have had and, may continue to have a significant adverse effect on our customers and the markets in which we conduct our business. The extent of impacts resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and other events beyond our control will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact, among others.\nDisruptions to our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. The escalation of the pandemic may also negatively impact regional economic conditions for a period of time, resulting in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations and deposit availability.\nFor a description of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business and results of operations during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition - Impact of COVID-19\u201d beginning at page 36. If the global response to contain COVID-19 escalates or is unsuccessful, we could experience additional effects, including a material adverse effect, on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 outbreak and the governmental responses may disrupt banking and other financial activity in the\nareas in which we operate and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues for us.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the U.S. federal, state and local governmental responses may result in a disruption in the services we provide. We rely on our third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with these services or experience interruptions in their ability to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our customers. Furthermore, the coronavirus pandemic could negatively impact the ability of our employees and customers to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which we operate and could create widespread business continuity issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to infection, quarantine or other effects and restrictions of a COVID-19 outbreak in our market areas. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective. If we are unable to promptly recover from such business disruptions, our business and financial conditions and results of operations would be adversely affected. We also may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur past participation in the SBA PPP loan program exposes us to risks related to noncompliance with the PPP, as well as\nlitigation risk related to our administration of the PPP loan program, which could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participated as a lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short window between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. For instance, other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As previously announced, we have sold our PPP loan portfolio, however, we may be required to repurchase, and as a result be exposed to credit risk, on sold PPP loans in certain circumstances if a determination is made by the SBA that there was a deficiency by the Bank with respect to the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced.\nInterest rate volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and the economy in general. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to increasing credit risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a commercial lender, we are exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks with respect to the risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. As the overall economic climate in the U.S., generally, and in our market areas specifically, experiences material\ndisruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans and governmental actions may provide payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings in certain circumstances and, as a result, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nWe are actively working to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although recent regulatory guidance provides that such loan modifications are exempt from the calculation and reporting of TDRs and loan delinquencies, we cannot predict whether such loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods. Our inability to successfully manage the increased credit risk caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnpredictable future developments related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect\nour business and results of operations.\nBecause there have been no comparable recent global pandemics that resulted in a similar global impact, we do not yet know the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. Any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operation, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. However, if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise results in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios could be materially adversely affected and many of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be heightened.\nRisks Related to General Economic and Market Conditions\nThe Corporation\u2019s performance and financial condition may be adversely affected by national and regional economic conditions and real estate values.\nThe U.S. economy experienced a recession during 2020 and unemployment rates remain elevated as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. A continuation of those recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and\ninternational credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. In addition, the Bank\u2019s loan and deposit activities are largely based in eastern Pennsylvania. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s consolidated financial performance depends largely upon economic conditions in this eastern Pennsylvania region. Continuing higher unemployment rates and deterioration in the regional real estate market could harm our financial condition and results of operations because of the geographic concentration of loans within this regional area and because a large percentage of our loans are secured by real property. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and continuing higher unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. If real estate values decline, the collateral for the Corporation\u2019s loans will provide less security. As a result, the Corporation\u2019s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished, and the Bank will be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio is invested in commercial real estate loans. Often in a commercial real estate transaction, repayment of the loan is dependent on rental income. Economic conditions may affect the tenant\u2019s ability to make rental payments on a timely basis, or may cause some tenants not to renew their leases, each of which may impact the debtor\u2019s ability to make loan payments. Further, if expenses associated with commercial properties increase dramatically, the tenant\u2019s ability to repay, and therefore the debtor\u2019s ability to make timely loan payments, could be adversely affected.\nAll of these factors could increase the amount of the Corporation\u2019s non-performing loans, increase its provision for credit losses and reduce the Corporation\u2019s net income.\nEconomic troubles may negatively affect our leasing business.\nThe Corporation\u2019s leasing business consists of the nationwide leasing of various types of equipment to small- and medium-sized businesses. Economic sluggishness may result in higher credit losses than we would experience in our traditional lending business, as well as potential increases in state regulatory burdens such as state income taxes, personal property taxes and sales and use taxes.\nA general economic slowdown could impact Wealth Management Division revenues.\nA general economic slowdown may cause current clients to seek alternative investment opportunities with other providers, which would decrease the value of Wealth Management Division's assets under management and administration resulting in lower fee income to the Corporation.\nRevenues from our capital markets business line may be adversely affected by adverse market or economic conditions.\nUnfavorable financial or economic conditions have the ability to reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide capital markets advisory and other advisory services. Specifically, a number of our clients engaging in capital markets and strategic and other types of transactions often rely on access to the equity and credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available equity investments or credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of these transactions by our clients. Because the revenues of our capital markets business are in the form of financial advisory other fees and are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate, a decrease in the number and size of transactions would adversely affect our capital markets business.\nGovernmental discretionary policies may impact the operations and earnings of the Corporation.\nThe operations of the Corporation are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board regulates monetary policy and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of all financial institutions in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\nMarket Risk\nRapidly changing interest rate environment could reduce the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin, net interest income, fee income and net income.\nInterest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a significant part of the Corporation\u2019s net income. Interest rates are key drivers of the Corporation\u2019s net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond the Corporation's control. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. Rapidly increasing interest rates in the future could result in interest expenses increasing faster than interest income because of divergence in financial instrument maturities and/or competitive pressures. Further, substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease net interest income. Changes in interest rates might also impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and administration by the Wealth Management Division which may have a negative impact on fee income. See the section captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in the MD&A section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding interest rate risk.\nA large or unexpected rise in interest rates could materially impact consumer and business ability to repay, thus increasing our level of nonperforming loans and reducing demand for loans. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur mortgage servicing rights could become impaired, which may require us to take non-cash charges.\nBecause we have retained the servicing rights on loans which we have sold in the secondary market, we are required to record a mortgage servicing right asset, which we test quarterly for impairment. The value of mortgage servicing rights is heavily dependent on market interest rates and tends to increase with rising interest rates and decrease with falling interest rates. If we are required to record an impairment charge, it would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclines in asset values may result in impairment charges or credit losses and may adversely affect the value of the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA majority of the Corporation\u2019s investment portfolio is comprised of securities which are collateralized by residential mortgages. These residential mortgage-backed securities include securities of U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored entities, and private-label collateralized mortgage obligations. The Corporation\u2019s securities portfolio also includes obligations of U.S. government-sponsored entities, obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, corporate bonds, and collateralized loan obligations. The fair value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the obligations themselves, such as rating downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity for resale of certain investment securities. Quarterly, the Corporation evaluates investments and other assets for credit losses or impairment indicators in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Given the significant judgments involved, if we are incorrect in our assessment, this error could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows. If the Corporation incurs credit losses or impairment charges that result in its falling below the \u201cwell capitalized\u201d regulatory requirement, it may need to raise additional capital. Further, a decline in the fair value of the securities in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nDowngrades in U.S. government and federal agency securities could adversely affect the Corporation.\nIn addition to causing economic and financial market disruptions, any downgrades in U.S. government and federal agency securities, or failures to raise the U.S. debt limit if necessary in the future, could, among other things, have a materially adverse effect on the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities that we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our business and our financial results and condition. In particular, it could increase interest rates and disrupt payment systems, money markets, and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, adversely affecting the cost and availability of funding, which could negatively affect profitability. Also, the adverse consequences of a downgrade could extend to the borrowers of the loans and leases the Bank makes and, as a result, could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and leases.\nCredit Risk\nProvision for credit losses on loans and leases and level of non-performing loans and leases may need to be modified in connection with internal or external changes.\nAll borrowers carry the potential to default and our remedies to recover may not fully satisfy money previously loaned. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses on loans and leases charged to expense, which represents the Corporation\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases (as adjusted for prepayments and reasonably expected TDRs). The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, in the judgment of the Corporation, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases reflects the Corporation\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present and future economic conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current and expected credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in current and future economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans and leases or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of the Corporation. An increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases results in a decrease in net income, and possibly risk-based capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFASB ASU 2016-13 has resulted in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses on loans and leases and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIssued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326 - Credit Losses), commonly referenced as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d), eliminates the Provision for Loan and Lease Losses (the \u201cProvision\u201d) and Allowance for Loan and Lease\nLosses (the \u201cAllowance\u201d) line items and establishes the Provision for Credit Losses (\"PCL\") and Allowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") line items.\nThe new CECL standard requires projection of credit loss over the contract lifetime of loans and leases, adjusted for prepayment tendencies. Further, management\u2019s specific expectations for the future economic environment must be incorporated in the projection, with loss expectations to revert to the long-run historical mean after such time as management can make or obtain a reasonable and supportable forecast. This valuation reserve has been established in the ACL on loans and leases and is maintained through expense (provision) in the PCL. The methodology for determining the Corporation's ACL on loans and leases under the CECL standard is a dynamic process that relies on third party economic forecasts, and incorporate changes in various factors including, but not limited to, levels and trends of delinquencies and charge-offs, trends in volume and types of loans, national and economic trends and industry conditions. As a result, the Corporation's ACL on loans and leases may fluctuate materially, which in turn causes fluctuation in the Corporations PCL (or recapture). These fluctuations may have a material impact on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nPotential losses incurred in connection with possible repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market may require us to increase our financial statement reserves in the future.\nWe engage in the origination and sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market. In connection with such sales, we make certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. These representations and warranties vary based on the nature of the transaction and the purchaser\u2019s or insurer\u2019s requirements, but generally pertain to the ownership of the mortgage loan, the real property securing the loan and compliance with applicable laws and applicable lender and government-sponsored entity underwriting guidelines in connection with the origination of the loan. While we believe our mortgage lending practices and standards to be adequate, we have settled a small number of claims we consider to be immaterial; we may receive requests in the future, however, which could be material in volume. If that were to happen, we could incur losses in connection with loan repurchases and indemnification claims, and any such losses might exceed our financial statement reserves, requiring us to increase such reserves. In that event, any losses we might have to recognize and any increases we might have to make to our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to attract and maintain customer and investor relationships depends largely on our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers and investors in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this report, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, customer personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third-party fraud, record-keeping, technology-related issues including but not limited to cyber fraud, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on our brands and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTechnological systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could negatively impact our operations and reputation.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits, and our loans. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, any compromise of our security systems could deter customers from using our web site and our online banking service, which involve the transmission of confidential information. Although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource certain of our data processing to third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for customer\ntransactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failure, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our customers and other institutions, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.\nWe, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Additionally, the existence of cyber attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including financial counterparties; financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber attack or other\ninformation or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses.\nCyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. Management diligently reviews and updates its internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s operations and prospects.\nThe Corporation currently depends on the services of a number of key management personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition. The Corporation\u2019s success also depends in part on the ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel. Competition for such personnel is strong and the Corporation may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires.\nClimate change, severe weather, natural disasters, global health risks or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nNatural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, global health risks or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue, or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nEnvironmental risk associated with our lending activities could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we perform limited environmental due diligence in conjunction with originating loans secured by properties that we believe have environmental risk, we could be subject to environmental liabilities on real estate properties we foreclose upon and take title to in the normal course of our business. In connection with environmental contamination, we may be held liable to governmental entities or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances at a property. The investigation or remediation costs associated with such activities could be substantial. Furthermore, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination even if we were the former owner of a contaminated site. The incurrence of a significant environmental liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are present even though we perform environmental due diligence on our collateral properties. Such diligence may not reflect all current risks or threats, and unforeseen or unpredictable future events may cause a change in the environmental risk profile of a property after a loan has been made.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal Risks\nIncreased regulatory oversight, uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Efforts in the United States to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and to a lesser extent securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently and we may incur significant costs to transition both our borrowing arrangements and the loan agreements with our customers from LIBOR, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Members from the Corporation\u2019s finance, lending, credit, capital markets, treasury and legal departments are leading our LIBOR transition efforts. Management has identified and evaluated the scope of existing financial instruments and contracts that may be affected by the transition, which are primarily within its commercial lending, consumer lending and capital markets lines of business. For those contracts which do not contain appropriate fallback language, management is conducting appropriate outreach to clients, as needed, to begin distributing amendments. Management continues to evaluate any needed enhancements or modifications to systems, controls and processes associated with the transition to a new reference rate or benchmark the reference rate alternatives.\nAccounting standards periodically change and the application of our accounting policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nThe regulatory bodies that establish accounting standards, including, among others, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The effect of such revised or new standards on our financial statements can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, management must exercise judgment in appropriately applying many of our accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, management may have to select a particular accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives. In some cases, the accounting policy or method chosen might be reasonable under the circumstances and yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported if we had selected a different policy or method. Accounting policies are critical to fairly presenting our financial condition and results of operations and may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.\nLegal proceedings to which we are subject or may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nLike many banks and other financial services organizations in our industry, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims and other legal actions related to our business activities brought by customers, employees and others. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts and judgments, injunctive relief, equitable relief, and other adverse consequences that may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, matters arising due to business expansion, or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment, or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate, or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. Legal proceedings to which we are subject or may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s earnings.\nIn February 2011, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC issued a ruling that changed the assessment base against which FDIC assessments for deposit insurance are made. Instead of FDIC insurance assessments being based upon an insured bank\u2019s deposits, FDIC insurance assessments are generally based on an insured bank\u2019s total average assets minus average tangible equity. A change in the risk categories applicable to BMBC\u2019s bank subsidiaries, further adjustments to base assessment rates, and any special assessments could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.\nIn addition, should bank failures begin to increase in number or the FDIC insurance fund become depleted in others ways, FDIC premiums could increase or additional special assessments could be imposed. These increased premiums would have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations.\nAny failure of BMBC, the Bank or their subsidiaries to comply with federal and state regulatory requirements, including but not limited to requirements with respect to residential mortgages, could adversely affect our business and net income.\nBMBC and the Bank are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the State of Delaware. Accordingly, BMBC, the Bank and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state legislation, regulation and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on almost all aspects of our business operations and which are primarily designed to protect consumers, depositors and the government's deposit insurance funds, and is not designed to protect shareholders. These include, but are not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act, the GLB Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, regulations and sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, real estate-secured consumer lending regulations (such as Truth-in-Lending), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulations, trust laws and regulations, and licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and insurance brokers. Federal and state banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties.\nBecause our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are continuously reviewed and change frequently. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the applicable laws, rule and regulations, there is risk that BMBC and the Bank may be determined not to have complied with applicable requirements, and any failure, even if such failure was unintentional or inadvertent, could result in adverse action to be taken by regulators, including through formal or informal supervisory enforcement actions, and could result in the assessment of fines and penalties. In some circumstances, additional negative consequences also may result from regulatory action, including restrictions on the Corporation\u2019s business activities, acquisitions and other growth initiatives. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIn addition, the Corporation originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which the Corporation utilizes to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\nThere is also no assurance that laws, rules and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, or that the enforcement of current or existing laws, rules or regulations will not be enhanced in the future, which in either case could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, modify, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) restrict our ability to foreclose on property securing loans, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. These risks could affect our deposit funding and the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which could negatively affect our financial performance and financial condition.\nPreviously enacted and potential future legislation, including legislation to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system, could adversely affect our business.\nThe change in President and political party controlling the Executive Branch of the Federal Government resulting from the 2016 U.S. presidential election brought changes to laws and regulations of the U.S. financial services industry, including the 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), and may continue to bring changes\nthat we cannot now predict. The EGRRCPA, which amended the Dodd-Frank Act, directed certain federal banking regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, to take action to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banks and financial institutions. Federal banking regulatory agencies are currently working on taking the actions congressionally mandated by the EGRRCPA; however, the 2021 change in President and political party has created uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, which may negatively impact our business.\nAdditionally, the federal government has passed a variety of other reforms related to banking and the financial industry including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed significant regulatory and compliance changes. Effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business include:\n\u2022changes to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022exclusion of hybrid securities, including trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from Tier I capital;\n\u2022creation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will oversee systemic risk, and the CFPB, which will develop and enforce rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u2022potential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022changes to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022regulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022changes in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u2022changes in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The EGRRCPA provided an exemption from the Volcker Rule\u2019s restrictions for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some of which have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until implementation. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act could limit our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise materially and adversely affect us. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements could also materially and adversely affect us.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the \u201cFederal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof,\u201d with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\u201cUDAAP authority\u201d). The potential reach of the CFPB\u2019s broad rulemaking powers and UDAAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank, is currently unknown.\nOur ability to realize our deferred tax asset may be reduced as a result of the tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017, which could adversely impact results of operation and negatively affect our financial condition.\nRealization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences. The deferred tax asset may be reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset. If it is determined that a valuation allowance of its deferred tax asset is necessary, the Corporation may incur a charge to earnings. The value of our deferred tax asset is directly related to the income tax rates in effect at the time of use. In late 2017, the U.S. Congress passed significant legislation\nreforming the Internal Revenue Code known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\" or the \u201cTax Act\u201d). On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform\u201d), was signed into law. The Tax Act, among other changes, reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the Tax Act, the Corporation recorded a $15.2 million one-time income tax charge related to the re-measurement of the Corporation\u2019s net deferred tax asset, triggered by the Tax Act, during the year ended December 31, 2017, and a $2.5 million tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 for certain discrete items included on our 2017 tax return that was filed during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nStrategic Risks\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation\u2019s business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to advance our strategic objectives by opening new branches or offices or acquiring and investing in banks and in other complementary businesses, such as wealth advisory or insurance agencies. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material to us. For example, we could issue additional shares of common stock in a purchase transaction, which could dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interest. These activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill would not directly impact cash flow or tangible capital.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in the Corporation\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022the time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022experiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations;\n\u2022creating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received;\n\u2022risk of significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity being acquired into the Corporation\u2019s financial and customer product systems; and,\n\u2022potential impairment of intangible assets created in business acquisitions.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets, and our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future which could limit the growth of our business.\nWe may not be able to sustain a positive rate of growth or expand our business. We expect that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in acquiring other financial institutions if we pursue such acquisitions. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals for a transaction, we will not be able to consummate such transaction which we believe to be in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Other factors, such as economic conditions and legislative considerations, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. If we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetition Risks\nChanges in interest rates and other pricing decisions by our competitors could affect our net income.\nThe Corporation originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors affect demand for the Corporation's residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, ultimately reducing the Corporation's net income.\nThe financial services industry is very competitive, especially in the Corporation\u2019s market area, and such competition could affect our operating results.\nThe Corporation faces competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services such as trust and investment management services throughout the Corporation\u2019s market area. The Corporation\u2019s competitors include other community banks, larger banking institutions, trust companies and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, registered investment advisors, financial planning firms, leasing companies, government-sponsored enterprises, on-line banking enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the Corporation. This is especially evident in regard to advertising and public relations spending. For a more complete discussion of our competitive environment, see \u201cGeneral Development and Description of Our Business Competition\u201d in Item 1 above. If the Corporation is unable to compete effectively, the Corporation may lose market share and income from deposits, loans, and other products may be reduced.\nAdditionally, increased competition among financial services companies due to consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services.\nFailure to meet customer expectations for technology-driven products and services could reduce demand for bank and wealth services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so on our part could significantly reduce the number of new wealth and bank customers resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nThe capital and credit markets are volatile and could have a detrimental impact on our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations and may need to raise additional capital in the future, whether in the form of debt or equity, to provide us with sufficient capital resources to meet our regulatory and business needs. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The capital and credit markets periodically experience volatility. In some cases, the markets may produce downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers seemingly without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. Market volatility may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or our ability to access capital. Several factors could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future, including without limitation:\n\u2022announcements of developments related to our business, any of our competitors or the financial services industry in general;\n\u2022fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our securities into the marketplace;\n\u2022general conditions in our markets or the worldwide economy;\n\u2022a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022our announcement of new acquisitions or other projects; and\n\u2022compliance with regulatory changes.\nIf the Corporation is unable to generate sufficient additional capital though its earnings, or other sources, including sales of assets, and the Corporation is unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, it would be necessary to slow earning asset growth and or pass up possible acquisition opportunities, which may result in a reduction of future net income growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf sufficient wholesale funding to support earning-asset growth is unavailable, the Corporation\u2019s net income may decrease.\nManagement recognizes the need to grow both non-wholesale and wholesale funding sources to support earning asset growth and to provide appropriate liquidity. The Corporation\u2019s asset growth over the past few years has been supplemented by various forms of wholesale funding which is defined as wholesale deposits (primarily wholesale certificates of deposit) and borrowed funds (Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\u201cFHLB\u201d), Federal advances and Federal fund line borrowings). Wholesale funding at December 31, 2020 represented approximately 7.2% of total funding compared to 18.0% at December 31, 2019 and 17.1% at December 31, 2018. Wholesale funding is subject to certain practical limits such as the FHLB\u2019s Maximum Borrowing Capacity and the Corporation\u2019s liquidity targets. Additionally, regulators might consider wholesale funding beyond certain points to be imprudent and might suggest that future asset growth be reduced or halted.\nIn the absence of wholesale funding sources, the Corporation may need to reduce earning asset growth through the reduction of current production, sale of assets, and/or the participating out of future and current loans or leases. This in turn might reduce future net income of the Corporation.\nThe amount loaned to us is generally dependent on the value of the collateral pledged and the Corporation\u2019s financial condition. These lenders could reduce the percentages loaned against various collateral categories, eliminate certain types of collateral and otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs, particularly to the extent they are required to do so because of capital adequacy or other balance sheet concerns, or if disruptions in the capital markets occur. Any change or termination of our borrowings from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve or correspondent banks may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock, like many of our peers, has fluctuated significantly over the recent past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for holders of our common stock to resell their common stock when desired and at desirable prices. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022Inaccurate management decisions regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired which could materially affect our financial condition;\n\u2022Natural disasters, fires, and severe weather;\n\u2022Failure of internal controls;\n\u2022Rumors or erroneous information;\n\u2022Reliance on other companies to provide key components of our business processes;\n\u2022Meeting capital adequacy standards and the need to raise additional capital in the future if needed, including through future sales of our common stock;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022Recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022Failure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;\n\u2022Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the current economic downturn;\n\u2022Perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022Departure of our management team or other key personnel;\n\u2022New technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022Existing or increased regulatory and compliance requirements, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations;\n\u2022Governmental investigations and actions;\n\u2022Changes in government regulations or restructuring of government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;\n\u2022New litigation or changes in existing litigation; and\n\u2022Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results as evidenced by the current volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on common stock.\nOur shareholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we currently pay quarterly dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Pennsylvania law, by the Federal Reserve, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures, and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, debt service requirements, other cash needs and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Notification to the Federal Reserve is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our shareholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the Federal Reserve objects or until such time as we receive approval from the Federal Reserve or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our shareholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nAny decisions to suspend or discontinue our stock repurchase plan could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAlthough BMBC has previously repurchased its common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs, our stock repurchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. A suspension or discontinuation of our stock repurchase plan could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, the existence of a stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the liquidity of our stock. As a result, any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources.", "PERMNO": 86124, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BMTC"}
