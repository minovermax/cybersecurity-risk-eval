{"cik": "1213660", "company": "BOQI International Medical, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this annual report, in evaluating BOQI International Medical Inc. and our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere Are Doubts about the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\nThe Company\u2019s independent auditors have raised doubts about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources, such as securities, debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack\nof additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations, or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company intends to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of new sources of revenues, with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional financing. The Company anticipates raising additional funds through public or private financing, securities financing and/or strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations; however, the Company may not have commitments from third parties for a sufficient amount of additional capital. The Company cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and its failure to raise capital when needed could limit its ability to continue its operations. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional funding will determine its ability to continue as a going concern. Failure to secure additional financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial performance, results of operations and share price and require it to curtail or cease operations, sell off its assets, seek protection from its creditors through bankruptcy proceedings, or otherwise. Furthermore, additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of the Company\u2019s shares, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, and strategic relationships, if necessary, to raise additional funds, and may require that the Company relinquish valuable rights. Any additional financing could have a negative effect on shareholders.\nWe are in the early stages of development of our Pharmacy Group business and have limited operating history on which you can base an investment decision.\nWe were formed in 2006, but recently changed our business focus. We are now focused on growing our healthcare business. As a result, we may encounter many expenses, delays, problems, and difficulties that we have not anticipated and for which we have not planned. There can be no assurance that at this time we will successfully develop or acquire a significant base of customers, operate profitably, or that we will have adequate working capital to fund our operations or meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur recently acquired operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the initial expenses, challenges, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of any new business. Investors should evaluate an investment in our company in light of the problems and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies attempting to develop new markets. Despite best efforts, we may never overcome these obstacles to achieve financial success. Our business is speculative and dependent upon the implementation of our business plan, as well as our ability to successfully acquire businesses on terms that will be commercially viable for us. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or result in revenue or profit. There is no assurance that we will earn significant revenues or that our investors will not lose their entire investment.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDuring late 2019, a virus now known as the Novel Coronavirus or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d appeared in Wuhan, China. By March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled COVID-19 as a pandemic and many countries around the world began closing borders and making efforts to either shelter-in-place or quarantine its population. Our Company and all of our operations are located in China. During the first quarter of 2020, China placed a mandatory quarantine on certain areas, specifically in Wuhan located in Hubei Province.\nSince the pandemic broke out, our operations have been materially impacted. At the beginning of February 2020, the Chinese government issued a quarantine order, which lasted for more than two months in many parts of the country, where everyone had to stay at home. During February and March, all of our administrative functions had to be performed remotely. As such, we experienced great difficulty in timely organizing and collecting information and materials necessary for and in preparing our Annual Report. Furthermore, our independent auditors had no access to our offices where they typically inspect our books and records and original documents. Our independent auditors also were not able to conduct their audit of our inventories at the pharmacy stores and the warehouse. Not until the beginning of April did we start to have a small skeleton crew working in our office and able to perform those functions that could not be handled remotely\nBecause of the pandemic, we suffered a significant reduction in sales. Because of the Chinese government\u2019s lockdown order, our customer traffic dropped greatly. Certain of our popular and high profit margin products could not be sold due to governmental restrictive orders, which also resulted in the expiration of a large quantify of our medicines that are otherwise in high demand in the winter season. We cannot be sure when this situation will improve.\nWe have incurred additional costs to ensure we meet the needs of our customers, including providing additional cleaning materials for our stores and other facilities. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. COVID-19 has also caused supply chain disruption which has resulted in higher supply chain costs to replenish inventory in our stores and distribution centers and such increased costs in our supply chain are likely to continue. Furthermore, we have experienced restricted stock availability in a number of key categories, and while we have significantly increased our purchases across many key categories, we may face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products which could negatively impact us. Because of the lockdown order in China that lasted for more than two months, we suffered reduced sales on a sequential basis and an operating loss in the first and second quarters of 2020. While our pharmacies were required to be kept open during the pandemic, there was little foot traffic and we were not able to sell cold and cough medicines, which are high profits popular winter season medicine, during a 3-week period in March 2020 due to government\u2019s restrictions, which resulted in significantly dropped sales in the first and second quarters of 2020. If similar lockdown orders or sales restrictions are implemented by the government again, they may have greater impact on our business.\nOur management is focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19, which has required and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources across our enterprise and will delay the availability of other value added services. For example, we have refocused certain resources to work on COVID-19 mitigation, have delayed the roll out of new growth initiatives, such as new product launches, and are selectively delaying investments in certain planned initiatives. Additionally, currently some of our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which will adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In addition to volatility in consumer demand and buying habits, we may restrict the operations of our stores or distribution facilities if we deem it necessary or if recommended or mandated by governmental authorities which would have a further adverse impact on us.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the severity of the virus; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business and other actions (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates to provide products or services); the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of shelter-in-place orders affecting foot traffic in our stores; the impacts on our supply chain; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the extent and duration of the effect on consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns including spend on discretionary categories; the effects of additional store closures or other changes to our operations; the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions, particularly if members of our work force are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our team members and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nChina has slowly begun to relax some quarantine measures and allowed some businesses to operate again. We cannot make any assurances that COVID-19 will not reappear with new infections and to the extent that COVID-19, or another virus appears, we may encounter prolonged operational lockdown measures which would disrupt our business operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of existing debt, which may restrict our financing and operating flexibility and have other adverse consequences; defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our significant level of debt could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and liabilities;\n\u25cf making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf requiring that a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to servicing debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us to fund working capital, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf impeding our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing and increasing the cost of any such borrowing, particularly due to the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt; and\n\u25cf adversely affecting public perception of us.\nAlthough we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. To date, a number of the suppliers to the NF Group have initiated litigation with respect to unpaid bills. If we fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities.\nWe have had a history of losses and our ability to grow sales and achieve profitability are unpredictable.\nWe have incurred losses in each of the last seven years. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $10.88 million and incurred net losses of approximately $4.45 million and $17.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our ability to maintain and improve future levels of sales and profitability depends on many factors, which include:\n\u25cf successfully implementing our business strategy;\n\u25cf increasing revenues; and\n\u25cf controlling costs\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our business plan, meet our challenges and become profitable in the future.\nWe may encounter difficulties in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of recent business acquisitions. We expect to make additional acquisitions in the future that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nA significant part of our business strategy is to pursue acquisitions and other initiatives to spot market opportunities and to expand our business. On October 14, 2019, we acquired Boqi Zhengji which operates a pharmacy chain business in the PRC. On March 18, 2020, we acquired Chongqing Guanzan Technology, a pharmaceutical and medical devices distribution business based in Chongqing, the largest city in the Southwest region of the PRC.\nNo assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In the future, we may seek to acquire or make strategic investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or enter into strategic partnerships or alliances with third parties in order to expand our business. Failure to manage and successfully integrate such acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products technologies and professional services to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has previously operated successfully, there can be no assurance that our pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such businesses. If we acquire other businesses, we may face difficulties, including:\n\u25cf Difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired businesses or enterprises;\n\u25cf Diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;\n\u25cf Integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\u25cf Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and\n\u25cf The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans.\nSome of our business expansion activities may not be successful and may divert our resources from our existing business activities.\nPrior to the Boqi acquisition we were engaged in the energy efficiency enhancement business which was classified as a discontinued operation in 2019. Since October 2019, we have focused on providing consumer-directed health products and related services, including offering and designing \u201chealthy lifestyle plans\u201d for our customers and helping them focus more on preventative measures such as the consumption nutritional foods and dietary supplements and regular health checkups. We may fail to successfully develop or commercialize such services or new business that we acquire.\nWe may not be successful in disposing of our energy effectiveness enhancement business.\nOur energy efficiency enhancement business, operated through NF Group, has suffered operating losses in the last seven years, especially in 2018, when the PRC government adopted a series of policies to favor more environmentally friendly projects and products. Our net loss from the operation of the energy efficiency enhancement business was $16.79 million in 2018 and $2.18 million in 2019. We explored many different methods and channels in the effort to revive this business, including attempts to expand to the international markets, before we determined this business was not sustainable for us any longer. In late 2019, we committed to a plan to dispose of the NF Group. On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into the NF SPA. Pursuant to the NF SPA, the aggregate sale price for the NF Group is $10,000,000, determined based on the value of the total assets of NF Group as of September 30, 2019, to be paid in cash at the closing. The closing of the NF SPA is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the representations and warranties of the parties contained in the NF SPA are true and correct in all material respects on the closing date and that applicable consents and approvals required to be obtained by the parties have been obtained and not withdrawn. The NF SPA may be terminated under certain circumstances, including by either party if the other party is in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in the NF SPA. We have also agreed to indemnify the buyer with respect to losses related to or resulting from any breach of our representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.\nThere can be no assurance that the sale of the NF Group will be closed pursuant to the terms of the NF SPA or within an acceptable timeframe. If the sale is not closed or not closed within an acceptable timeframe, a failed transaction would result in a severe interruption to our operations, management and employees. Furthermore, the continued operation of NF Group will likely have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nRaising additional capital will be difficult and may cause dilution to our shareholders and restrict our operations.\nWe expect to finance our cash needs from outside sources for our working capital and the payment of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration for the Boqi Acquisition and the Guanzan Acquisition, and other anticipated acquisitions.\nAlthough we have been able to obtain funding from outside sources, we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to do so or to obtain additional financing on favorable terms. One possible impediment to raising capital is the tightening credit policies of the Chinese banks and the continued effects of tightening in the global credit markets. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to operate our business, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. We cannot be sure that we will be able to secure all the financing we will require, or that it will be available on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain necessary l financing, we will be required to substantially curtail our approach to implementing our business objectives.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect shareholder rights. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures.\nWe are subject to the risks of any growing enterprise, any one of which could limit our growth and our product and market development.\nOur operating history makes it difficult to predict how our businesses will develop and where and if we will find success. Accordingly, we face all of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in similar stages of development, such as: (i) uncertain and continued market acceptance for our services; (ii) the evolving nature of the healthcare industry in the PRC, where significant consolidation may occur, leading to the formation of companies which will be better able to compete with us than is currently the case; (iii) the fragmented nature of the pharmacy chain business which may limit our ability to penetrate the market and provide comprehensive solutions on a sufficiently wide geographic basis to make the business profitable; (iv) changing competitive conditions, technological advances or customer preferences could adversely affect the sales of our product offerings or services; (v) maintaining our competitive position in area in which we operate in the PRC and competing with other companies, many of which have longer operating histories and greater financial resources than us; (vi) continuing to offer a broad range of commercially successful products to attract and retain a larger base of direct customers; (vii) maintaining effective control of our costs and expenses; and (viii) retaining our management and skilled staff and recruiting additional key employees.\nIf we are not able to meet the challenges of building our businesses and managing our growth, the likely result will be, lower margins, additional operational costs and continued operating losses.\nThe markets in which we now operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us.\nWe face intense competition with local, regional and national companies, including other drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores and internet pharmacies. Competition from on-line retailers has significantly increased during the past few years. Some of our competitors have or may merge with or acquire pharmaceutical services companies, health insurance companies, mail order facilities or enter into strategic partnership alliances with wholesalers, which may further increase competition. We may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours. Further, we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors. The ability of our stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of loyal, repeat customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to effectively compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition, or that any of our competitors are not in a better position to absorb the impact of COVID-19.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nMany organizations in the healthcare industry have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power, which has contributed to continued pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services and/or reduce our access to customers. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices and/or reduce our access to customers, our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our new strategy also includes selective acquisition opportunities and we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, health epidemics and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters and the operations of our key vendors, logistics providers and partners, as well as many of our customers, are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire or a flood, or other catastrophic event, could have a material adverse effect on our or their business, which could in turn materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business could be subject to environmental liabilities.\nOur failure, or the failure of our partners, including our contract manufacturers, to comply with past, present and future environmental laws could result in fines, penalties, third-party claims, reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs and reputational damage, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners, including our contract manufacturers. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. Although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have limited business insurance coverage in China\nThe insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. As a result, we do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nBecause our funds are held in banks in the PRC that do not provide insurance, the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.\nBanks and other financial institutions in the PRC do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. A portion of our assets are in the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.\nWe substantially depend on a few key personnel who, if not retained, could cause declines in productivity and operational results and loss of our strategic guidance, all of which would diminish our business prospects and value to investors.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued service of a few executive officers and key employees, including, Mr. Yongquan Bi, our Chairman, and Mr. Tiewei Song, our Chief Executive Officer and President. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees would have an adverse effect on us and our PRC operating subsidiaries, as these individuals play a significant role in developing and executing our overall business plan and maintaining customer relationships and proprietary technology systems. While none of our key personnel is irreplaceable, the loss of the services of any of these individuals would be disruptive to our business. We believe that our overall future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial and marketing personnel. There is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on terms acceptable to the Company or the employee. Inadequate personnel will limit our growth, and will be seen as a detriment to our prospects, leading potentially to a loss in value for investors.\nWe are controlled by a small group of our existing stockholders, whose interests may differ from other stockholders.\nOur Chairman, Mr. Yongquan Bi, beneficially, together with a group of investors, owns approximately 44.15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and is the largest single stockholder. Accordingly, these stockholders acting together will have significant influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. They will also have significant influence in preventing or causing a change in control. In addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we may be prevented from entering into certain transactions which may be beneficial to our other stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of the other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover effects of proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws.\nWe are contemplating adopting provisions to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that other shareholders might consider in their best interest, including any attempt that might result in receipt of a premium over the market price for stockholders\u2019 shares of common stock. We intend to seek shareholder approval of such amendments in the near future. These provisions may include:\nClassified Board. Such amendments may provide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. As a result, approximately one third of our board of directors will be elected each year. The classification of directors will have the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may also provide that, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors will be fixed exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by our governing body.\nAction by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. Such amendments may provide that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by the Executive Committee (or, if it does not then-exist, the board of directors), the chairman, vice chairman or executive chairman of the board or the chief executive officer, or at the request of holders representing a majority of the total voting power of our issued and outstanding common stock, voting together as a single class. Except as described above, stockholders may not be permitted to call a special meeting or to require the board of directors to call a special meeting.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.\nThe Delaware General Corporation law and our bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against costs and expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. Consequently, we may be required to expend substantial funds to satisfy these indemnity obligations. Any payment in respect of these indemnification rights could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to implement effective internal controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify, such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management of public companies to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness thereof. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Due to the Company\u2019s limited resources, we currently do not have accounting personnel with extensive experience in maintaining books and records and preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which could lead to untimely identification and resolution of accounting matters inherent in the Company\u2019s financial transactions in accordance with US GAAP.\nAny failure to complete our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, including the one identified above, or to implement new or improved controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our public disclosures and reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nViolations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business operations, financial position, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\u2019s Common Stock\nTrading volume of our common stock has fluctuated from time to time, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at times and prices that investors feel are appropriate.\nTo date, the trading volume of our common stock has fluctuated, sometimes significantly. Generally, lower trading volumes adversely effects the liquidity of our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts\u2019 and the media\u2019s coverage of us. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market imposes listing standards on our common stock that we may not be able to fulfill, thereby leading to a possible delisting of our common stock.\nAs a listed Nasdaq Capital Market company, we are subject to rules covering, among other things, certain major corporate transactions, the composition of our Board of Directors and committees thereof, minimum bid price of our common stock and minimum stockholders equity. The failure to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market requirements may result in the de-listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price thereof.\nIf our common stock were to be de-listed, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common stock is de-listed, broker-dealers have certain regulatory requirements imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, further limiting the liquidity thereof. These factors could result in lower prices for shares of our common stock and/or limit an investor\u2019s ability to execute a transaction. In addition delisting from NASDAQ could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could lead to significant dilution to our stockholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions at a price per share significantly below the then market price.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nThe price for our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products and media reports by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions. The volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of our investment, to sell shares at a profit at any given time, or to plan purchases and sales in advance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nBecause we have not paid dividends and have no present intention of paying dividends, investors will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock unless and until investors sell their shares at profit.\nWe have never paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. Investors will only realize income on an investment in our stock in the event they sell or otherwise dispose of their shares at a price higher than the price they paid for their shares. Such a gain would result only from an increase in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including future earnings, the success of our business activities, general financial condition, future prospects, general business conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nRisk Related to Doing Business in China\nA recurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Flu, or another widespread public health problem, such as the spread of H1N1 (\u201cSwine\u201d) Flu, or COVID-19 in the PRC could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations in the PRC may be affected by the spread of public health problems including:\n\u25cf A renewed outbreak of SARS, Avian Flu or another widespread public health problem, such as the spread of H1N1 (\u201cSwine\u201d) Flu, in China, where all of our operations are located and where all of our sales occur, will have a negative effect on our operations. Such an outbreak will have an impact on our operations as a result of:\n\u25cf quarantines or closures of our facilities, which will severely disrupt our operations,\n\u25cf the sickness or death of our key officers and employees, and\n\u25cf a general slowdown in the Chinese economy.\nAny of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems will adversely affect our operations.\nAdverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\nAll of our business operations are currently conducted in the PRC, under the jurisdiction of the PRC government. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. China\u2019s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.\nThe Sino-U.S. trade war broke out since the U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a further 25% tariffs, the equivalent of $50 billion on Chinese goods in March 2018. China and the U.S. subsequently increased tariffs on imported goods and services that were produced initially from each other in several turns. The Sino-U.S. trade war has damaged the two countries\u2019 trade and economy and slowed down the growth of the worldwide economy. In January 2020, after 23 months of a trade war, China and the U.S. entered the first phase of economic and trade agreement to suspend the trade war. The two countries will continue to negotiate, with the hope to reach more fair trade agreements.\nThere is no guarantee that the U.S. and China will achieve the expected fair economy and trade agreements. If these trade policies come into force and the scope of them is further expanded, the volume of China-U.S. import and export trade would drop significantly, which will lead to deterioration in economic conditions of both countries and decrease of business and official activities between both countries.\nUnprecedented rapid economic growth in China may increase our costs of doing business, and may negatively impact our profit margins and/or profitability.\nOur business depends in part upon the availability of relatively low-cost labor and materials. Rising wages in China may increase our overall costs of production. In addition, rising consumer product costs, due to strong demand and greater scarcity, may increase our overall costs of goods sold. If we are not able to pass these costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices, our profit margins and/or profitability could decline\nWe may suffer currency exchange losses if the RMB depreciates relative to the US Dollar.\nOur reporting currency is the US dollar. However, substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. In July 2005, China changed its exchange rate regime by establishing a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The RMB is no longer officially pegged to the US dollar, and the exchange rate will have some flexibility. Despite fluctuations in the exchange rate in 2016, the floating exchange rate regime has remained stable. If the RMB depreciates relative to the US dollar, our revenues as expressed in our US dollar financial statements will decline in value and if the RMB appreciates relative to the US dollar, our revenues as expressed in our US dollar financial statements will increase in value. There are very limited hedging transactions available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, if at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into US dollars.\nLabor laws in the PRC may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn January 1, 2008, the PRC government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, or the New Labor Contract Law. The New Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly impacts the cost of an employer\u2019s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires certain terminations to be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, the New Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive all our revenues in RMB. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from SAFE or its local branch is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and can be remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions.\nThe Chinese government has strengthened the regulation of investments made by Chinese residents in offshore companies and reinvestments in China made by these offshore companies. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions.\nThe SAFE has adopted certain regulations that require registration with, and approval from, Chinese government authorities in connection with direct or indirect control of an offshore entity by Chinese residents. The term \u201ccontrol\u201d under SAFE regulation is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles or PRC companies by means of acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. The SAFE regulations retroactively require registration of investments in non-Chinese companies previously made by Chinese residents. In particular, the SAFE regulations require Chinese residents to file with SAFE information about offshore companies in which they have directly or indirectly invested and to make follow-up filings in connection with certain material transactions involving such offshore companies, such as mergers, acquisitions, capital increases and decreases, external equity investments or equity transfers. In addition, Chinese residents must obtain approval from SAFE before they transfer domestic assets or equity interests in exchange for equity or other property rights in an offshore company. A newly established enterprise in China which receives foreign investments is also required to provide detailed information about its controlling shareholders and to certify whether it is directly or indirectly controlled by a domestic entity or resident.\nIn the event that a Chinese shareholder with a direct or indirect stake in an offshore parent company fails to make the requisite SAFE registration, the Chinese subsidiaries of such offshore parent company may be prohibited from making distributions of profit to the offshore parent and from paying the offshore parent proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the Chinese subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above can result in liability under Chinese law for foreign exchange evasion.\nThese regulations may have a significant impact on our present and future structuring and investment. We have requested our shareholders who to our knowledge are PRC residents to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under these regulations. We intend to take all necessary measures to ensure that all required applications and filings will be duly made and all other requirements will be met. We further intend to structure and execute our future offshore acquisitions in a manner consistent with these regulations and any other relevant legislation. However, because it is presently uncertain how the SAFE regulations, and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted and implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with, qualify under, or obtain any approvals required by the regulations or other legislation. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any PRC shareholders of our company or any PRC company into which we invest will be able to comply with those requirements. The inability of our company or any PRC shareholder to secure required approvals or registrations in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions may subject us to legal sanctions, restrict our ability to pay dividends from our Chinese subsidiaries to our offshore holding company, and restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities or affect our ownership structure.\nThe PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to us and you, or could lead to penalties on us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In 1979, the PRC Government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past 40 years has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in mainland China. Our PRC operating subsidiaries are all subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in the PRC in general and laws and regulations applicable to foreign invested companies in particular.\nIt may be difficult to enforce any civil judgments against us or our board of directors or officers, because all of our operating and/or fixed assets are located outside of the United States.\nAlthough we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, all of our operating and fixed assets are located in the PRC. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments outside the United States obtained in actions brought against us in the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. In addition, our directors and officers (principally based in the PRC) and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon those directors and officers, or to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. We have been advised by our PRC counsel that, in their opinion, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the PRC, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States or the securities laws of any state of the United States.\nBecause our assets are located overseas, shareholders may not receive distributions that they would otherwise be entitled to if we were declared bankrupt or insolvent.\nBecause all of our assets are located in the PRC, they may be outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to administer if we are the subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. As a result, if we declared bankruptcy or insolvency, our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the U.S., under U.S. Bankruptcy law.", "PERMNO": 12358, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "BIMI"}
