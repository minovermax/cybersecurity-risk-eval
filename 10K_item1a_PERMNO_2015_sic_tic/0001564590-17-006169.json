{"cik": "868725", "company": "RENTECH, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risk factors related to our business. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of these and various other factors, including those set forth in our other periodic and current reports filed with the SEC, from time to time. If any risks or uncertainties develop into an actual event, our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Consolidated Business, Liquidity, Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nWe may need additional liquidity in the event that our current and expected sources of funding are insufficient to fund working capital and to continue our operations. If we require additional capital and are unable to obtain it, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit of $362.7 million as of December 31, 2016. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand and expected working capital to fund operations and corporate activities through calendar year 2017, but we may have costs associated with idling the Wawa Facility and other events could arise that could increase our liquidity needs in 2017. We may also need additional liquidity to fund corporate activities through the first quarter of 2018. As a result of the above, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the issuance of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Management\u2019s plans to address these concerns are discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for these consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nVendors and other key contract counterparties of the Company and its subsidiaries may be reluctant to enter into contracts with us if they believe we may not be able to satisfy our obligations. Our inability to enter into such contracts could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have implemented plans to address our liquidity needs through a combination of cost reductions and pursuing strategic alternatives. However, there is no assurance that the strategic review process will result in a transaction, that we will achieve the cost savings we expect or that we will not require an additional source of funds. If we are required to obtain additional funds, there is no assurance we will be able to do so. Because our stock price has recently significantly declined, it may not be possible to obtain equity financing on acceptable terms or at all. The agreements governing our indebtedness limit our ability to obtain debt financing. The GSO Credit Agreement generally does not allow us to obtain debt financing without the consent of the lenders. Further, to the extent\nwe are able to incur additional indebtedness with the consent of the lenders, it may not be possible to obtain debt financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we require additional capital and are unable to obtain it, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have never operated at a profit. If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and, excluding the gain on sale of RNP, have never operated at a profit. From our inception on December 18, 1981 through December 31, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of $362.7 million. If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations. Ultimately, our ability to remain in business will depend upon earning a profit from our wood fibre processing business. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments or other business activities, reduce or eliminate future borrowings, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other obligations. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations. Failure to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations on time would give rise to remedies against us by our creditors.\nWe are subject to covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, which impose restrictions on us.\nWe are subject to covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness, guarantees and other contingent obligations, incur liens, make negative pledges, pay dividends or make other distributions, make payments to our subsidiaries, make certain loans and investments, consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, enter into sale-leaseback transactions and enter into transactions with affiliates. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nWe expect that NEWP will need to renew its $6 million revolving credit facility in May of 2017. However, there can be no assurance the revolving credit facility will be renewed or refinanced on acceptable terms. If the revolving credit facility is not renewed or refinanced, NEWP may not be able to meet its working capital needs and this likely would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nUnder the GSO Credit Agreement we are required to maintain at least $5 million of cash on hand, including cash available for distribution from our subsidiaries. The GSO Credit Agreement also contains a change of control covenant that may be impacted in the event a transaction results from the process we have initiated to explore a variety of strategic alternatives for the Wawa Facility and the Company as a whole. Under NEWP\u2019s revolving credit facility, NEWP must receive the lender\u2019s prior approval before making any cash distributions to Rentech. NEWP must also comply with its financial performance covenants in its debt agreements. These covenants include maintaining: (i) a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.4 to 1.0 on a trailing four quarter basis, (ii) a senior debt coverage ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0 on a trailing four quarter basis and (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.2 to 1.0 calculated at the end of each calendar year. NEWP\u2019s ability to comply with its financial performance covenants depends on many factors, including reduced sales from warmer than normal winters and increased production costs resulting from required production process modifications.\nFulghum is required to comply with the financial performance covenants in its debt agreements. These covenants include maintaining (i) a minimum cash flow coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0, measured on a consolidated basis for Fulghum and its domestic subsidiaries and collectively for selected projects and (ii) a minimum tangible net worth of no less than $11.28 million plus 50% of the net income of Fulghum from and after December 31, 2010. In the event that Fulghum does not comply with these covenants, the debt agreements do not permit it to make cash distributions to Rentech. Such a failure to comply would also constitute an event of default under the Fulghum debt agreements. Fulghum\u2019s ability to maintain compliance with its financial performance covenants depends on many factors, including customer demand for processing of wood chips.\nIn the event that either NEWP or Fulghum ceases to comply with their financial performance covenants as a result of the factors described above or other factors, NEWP or Fulghum, as applicable, would need to obtain an amendment or waiver under its respective debt agreements, including its financial covenants, and there can be no assurance that we would obtain such an amendment or waiver on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn the event that NEWP or Fulghum is not permitted to make cash distributions to Rentech, these restrictions would limit Rentech\u2019s ability to use the cash to fund its corporate activities and operations. Further, an event of default under the NEWP or Fulghum indebtedness could constitute an event of default under the GSO Credit Agreement.\nIn the event of a default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, unless waived, the lenders would have all remedies available to a lender, including the ability to cause the outstanding amounts of such indebtedness to become due and payable in full, institute foreclosure proceedings against any assets securing the indebtedness, and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not be able to achieve the cost savings we expect from our cost-savings and restructuring measures.\nIf we are not able to successfully execute and realize the expected financial benefits from our restructuring measures, our business could be adversely affected. We have implemented cost-savings and restructuring measures in our wood fibre processing business and corporate activities to focus on operations and execution, while significantly reducing corporate overhead. We expect these measures to result in annual SG&A expense reductions in the range of approximately $20 million, but these measures may not be successful or result in the level of cost savings that we had anticipated. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings may be affected by a number of factors. Actual charges, costs and adjustments related to these operational changes may vary materially from our estimates, and these operational changes may require cash and non-cash costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts, which could reduce anticipated cost savings.\nAfter the completion of the Merger, the idling of the Wawa Facility and the reduction in production at the Atikokan Facility, we are a less diversified company dependent on the success of our continuing wood fibre processing business.\nUpon the completion of the Merger, we are a less diversified company with a focus only in the wood fibre processing industry. Additionally, a large portion of our wood fibre processing business has been reduced by the idling of the Wawa Facility and a reduction in production at the Atikokan Facility. These actions have further concentrated our business within the wood processing and chipping industry through Fulghum and wood pelletizing for the U.S. home heating market through NEWP. As a result, our success is dependent on successful operation of our continuing wood fibre processing assets, and the risks related to our wood fibre processing business will have a more significant impact on us. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategy for our wood fibre processing business, or successfully mitigate the risks associated with this business, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny operational disruption at our facilities, as a result of equipment failure, an accident, adverse weather, a natural disaster or another interruption, could result in a reduction of sales volumes and could cause us to incur substantial expenditures. A prolonged disruption could materially affect the cash flow we expect from our facilities, or lead to a default under our debt agreements or other material agreements.\nThe equipment at our facilities could fail and could be difficult to replace. Our facilities may be subject to significant interruption if they were to experience a major accident or equipment failure, including accidents or equipment failures caused during expansion projects, if they were damaged by severe weather or natural disaster or if there are unforeseen regulatory problems. Significant shutdowns at our facilities could significantly reduce the amount of product available for sale, which could reduce or eliminate profits and cash flow from our operations.\nRepairs to our facilities could be expensive, and could be so extensive that our facilities could not economically be placed back into service. It has become increasingly difficult to obtain replacement parts for equipment and the unavailability of replacement parts could impede our ability to make repairs to our facilities when needed. We currently maintain property insurance, including business interruption insurance, but we may not have sufficient coverage, or may be unable in the future to obtain sufficient coverage at reasonable costs. A prolonged disruption at our facilities could materially affect the cash flow we expect from our facilities, or lead to a default under our debt agreements or other material agreements. As a result, operational disruptions at our facilities could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified and disclosed material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, one of which has resulted in a restatement of our financial statements. There is also the risk that additional control weaknesses could be discovered.\nAs we previously reported in 2015, there was a deficiency in effective internal controls over the review of the cash flow forecasts used in our accounting for long-lived asset impairment and recoverability. Specifically, there was a deficiency in effective internal controls related to documenting management\u2019s review of assumptions used in our cash flow forecasts for long-lived asset impairment and recoverability. This control deficiency, if unremediated, could result in a material misstatement to the annual or\ninterim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected by the controls. Accordingly, our management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.\nAdditionally, as we previously reported in 2016, there was a deficiency in effective internal controls over the allocation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) income tax expense between continuing and discontinued operations. Specifically, we did not perform certain procedures over the allocation of the GAAP tax provision between continuing and discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2016 in accordance with our designed controls. In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2016, this control deficiency resulted in a material adjustment prior to finalizing our presentation of GAAP income tax expense between continuing and discontinued operations in our recasted 2015 consolidated financial statements for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015.\nIn preparing our year-end financial statements for 2016, we identified that the control deficiency related to income taxes, as described above, also affected our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a result, we determined that the allocation of tax benefit and expense between continuing operations and discontinued operations for the affected periods should be revised. We determined that the income tax benefit from continuing operations and income tax expense from discontinued operations should be reduced by approximately $100 million and $80 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, we concluded that we should have recorded a non-cash deferred tax liability, which would have resulted in approximately $21.3 million of additional income tax expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and approximately $19.9 million of additional tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (due to a reduction of approximately $1.4 million in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016). The control deficiency resulted in a restatement of our financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as set forth in Note 24 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d in this report.\nFor a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weaknesses, see \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although management has implemented, and is continuing to implement, certain procedures to strengthen our internal controls, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, or if we discover additional control weaknesses, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, including a delisting from NASDAQ, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nObligations associated with being a small public company require significant company resources, management attention, and increased third party costs which may impose a disproportionate financial burden on us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a reporting company we are required, among other things, to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These are significant requirements for a small company with limited management and staff resources. The loss of services of any key executive or employee may exacerbate the challenges in complying with these reporting and other requirements. We may need to implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and increase our outsourcing of operating, tax, accounting, legal or finance services, which would require us to incur significant additional expenses. Because our resources are limited compared to many public companies, these requirements and additional expenses may impose a disproportionate financial burden on us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment in CVR Partners, L.P. (\u201cCVR\u201d) of approximately 7.2 million common units (the \u201cCVR Common Units\u201d) represents a significant portion of our assets. The value of our investment in CVR is highly volatile as the quarterly distributions paid with respect to the CVR Common Units could be as low as zero, and the proceeds from a future sale of such units could be materially less than our carrying value or the fair value for the CVR Common Units described herein. In subsequent periods, our investment in CVR Common Units could be impaired.\nCVR is a publically traded master limited partnership that owns and operates two nitrogen fertilizer product manufacturing facilities. The ability of CVR to pay quarterly cash distributions and the market price of its common units varies significantly both quarterly and annually. This is due to both fluctuations in nitrogen fertilizer demand and the seasonality of fertilizer application within the agricultural industry. Nitrogen fertilizer products are commodities, the price of which can be highly volatile. The price of nitrogen fertilizer products depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, cyclical trends in end-user markets, supply and demand imbalances, governmental policies and weather conditions, which have a greater relevance because of the seasonal nature of fertilizer application.\nFarmers tend to apply nitrogen fertilizer during two short application periods, one in the spring and the other in the fall, but nitrogen fertilizer producers generally produce products throughout the year. As a result, customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Variations in the proportion of product sold through prepaid sales contracts and variations in the terms of such contracts can increase the seasonal volatility of CVR\u2019s cash flows and cause changes in the patterns of seasonal volatility from year-to-year.\nDemand for nitrogen fertilizer products is also dependent on demand for crop nutrients from the global agricultural industry. The international market for nitrogen fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing nitrogen fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets, changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and investment. Profitability of CVR is also impacted by operating rates and volatility of operating costs, which in the case of natural gas historically have fluctuated significantly.\nFluctuations in the aforementioned factors historically have had and could in the future have significant effects on prices across all nitrogen fertilizer products and, in turn, on CVR\u2019s financial condition, its ability to pay quarterly distributions and the market price of its common units. Further, if there is a continuing or further decline in the value of the CVR Common Units that we believe is other than temporary, we could determine that it is necessary to impair the value of our investment in CVR.\nWe have recorded asset impairment charges with respect to our Wawa Facility and Atikokan Facility and goodwill impairment charges with respect to Fulghum, and we could be required to record additional material impairment charges and write-downs in the future.\nIn February 2017, we announced that we have (i) decided to idle the Wawa Facility and (ii) reduced production at the Atikokan Facility, to levels necessary to only fulfill the delivery requirements under the ten-year take-or-pay contract, or the OPG Contract, with Ontario Power Generation, or OPG. These decisions result from many factors, including without limitation, continued difficulty with ramping up production and additional capital required to increase to production to levels near the facilities design capacity, projected operating costs that exceed our original expectations and uncertainty around future profitability. Due to the challenges, we recorded net asset impairment charges for the Wawa Facility and the Atikokan Facility totaling $116.2 million in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn February 2017, Fulghum also was notified by a customer of its intent to exercise its purchase option on two of Fulghum\u2019s mills. Fulghum expects the loss of these mills to negatively impact operating income and cash flow in the second half of 2017 and going forward. While this was a subsequent event, the delays and extended negotiations during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and leading up to the customer\u2019s final decision were considered a triggering event to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test for Fulghum U.S. as of December 31, 2016. The analysis of goodwill indicated an impairment to goodwill of $11.7 million, which was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the loss of these mills could trigger additional impairments to Fulghum\u2019s assets and goodwill in the first half of 2017.\nIt is possible that more adverse changes to one or more of our businesses could require us to further reduce our expectations for their value in the future. If this were to occur, we could be required to record additional material impairment charges, including with respect to impairment of long-lived assets, and additional write-downs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our reputation.\nWe may incur costs to investigate and remediate known or suspected contamination at the Pasadena Facility, or to close the phosphogypsum stacks located at the Pasadena Facility in compliance with environmental laws.\nSoil and groundwater at the Pasadena Facility is pervasively contaminated. The facility has produced fertilizer since as early as the 1940s, and a large number of spills and releases have occurred at the facility, many of which involved hazardous substances. Contamination at the Pasadena Facility has the potential to result in toxic tort, property damage, personal injury and natural resources damages claims or other lawsuits. Further, regulators may require investigation and remediation at the facility in the future at significant expense. ExxonMobil, a former owner of the Pasadena Facility, submitted Affected Property Assessment Reports, or APARs, under the Texas Risk Reduction Program to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or the TCEQ, beginning in 2011 for the plant site and phosphogypsum stacks at the Pasadena Facility. The APARs identify instances in which various regulatory limits for numerous hazardous materials in both the soil and groundwater at the plant site and in the vicinity of the stacks have been exceeded. TCEQ may require ExxonMobil to perform additional investigative work as part of the APAR process. The TCEQ may also require further remediation of the contamination at the Pasadena Facility. The TCEQ or others could seek to hold us responsible for certain of the contamination at the Pasadena Facility, even though we no longer have an indirect ownership stake in the Pasadena Facility. Under environmental laws such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and state analogs, former owners and operators of facilities can be held responsible for investigating and remediating environmental contamination.\nThe Pasadena Facility was used for phosphoric acid production until 2011, which resulted in the creation of a number of phosphogypsum stacks at the Pasadena Facility. Phosphogypsum stacks are composed of the mineral processing waste that is the byproduct of the extraction of phosphorous from mineral ores. The EPA reached an agreement with ExxonMobil in September 2010 making ExxonMobil responsible for closure of the stacks, proper disposal of process wastewater related to the stacks and other expenses. As of January 2016, ExxonMobil estimated that its total outstanding costs associated with the closures and long-term maintenance, monitoring and care of the stacks will be $51.2 million over the next 50 years. However, the actual amount of such costs could be in excess of this amount. Although ExxonMobil has expended significant funds and resources relating to the closures, we cannot assure you that ExxonMobil will remain able and willing to complete closure and post-closure care of the stacks in the future.\nThe costs of investigating and remediating soil and groundwater contamination and closing and performing post-closure case of the phosphogypsum stacks at the Pasadena Facility will be substantial. The purchaser of the Pasadena Facility assumed liabilities for any environmental claims that may arise with respect to the Pasadena Facility, including closure of the phosphogypsum stacks. If ExxonMobil does not resolve the Pasadena Facility environmental contamination and phosphogypsum stack matters, and if the purchaser of the Pasadena Facility is unable or unwilling to do so, we could become financially responsible for Pasadena Facility environmental liabilities. If we become financially responsible for Pasadena Facility environmental liabilities, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Wood Fibre Processing and Wood Pellet Businesses\nWe have entered into various contracts relating to our Atikokan and Wawa Facilities, which will require us to pay penalties and could subject us to other damages and remedies to the extent that we do not comply with their terms.\nIn February 2017, we announced that we have (i) decided to idle the Wawa Facility and (ii) reduced production at the Atikokan Facility, to levels necessary to only fulfill the delivery requirements under the OPG Contract. Under the Drax Contract, we are required to sell to Drax the first 400,000 metric tons of wood pellets per year produced from our Wawa Facility and, under the OPG Contract, we are required to sell to OPG up to 90,000 metric tons of wood pellets per year from our Atikokan Facility.\nIf the Wawa Facility does not deliver wood pellets as required under the Drax Contract, the Wawa Company will be required to pay an amount equal to the difference between the contract price for the wood pellets and the price of any wood pellets purchased in replacement (if any). The Wawa Company also may be liable to Drax for other damages permitted to be recovered under the Drax Contract arising from the Wawa Company\u2019s non-delivery of wood pellets. A future increase in the market price of wood pellets from current market pricing could increase the liabilities of the Wawa Company to Drax. Under the Drax Contract, Rentech, Inc. has guaranteed the Wawa Company\u2019s obligations in an amount not to exceed CAD$20.0 million until May 1, 2018, and thereafter through the term of the Drax Contract for an amount not to exceed CAD$11.0 million.\nUnder the OPG Contract, OPG has the right to increase the delivery requirement of wood pellets from 45,000 metric tons to 90,000 metric tons after providing us specified advance notice. Although we expect to be able to meet our delivery requirements in a timely manner, we may be subject to penalties under the contract if we are not able to do so. Under the OPG Contract, Rentech, Inc. has guaranteed the Atikokan Company\u2019s obligations in an amount not to exceed CAD$1.0 million.\nRentech, Inc. has guaranteed the Wawa Company\u2019s monthly capital lease obligation payments under its agreement with QSL related to the pellet storage domes at the Port of Quebec. The remaining amount due under the capital lease is approximately $13.5 million at December 31, 2016. The Wawa Company has also entered into the Canadian National Contract for rail transportation of\nwood pellets from our Atikokan and Wawa Facilities to the Port of Quebec for delivery to Drax. Under the Canadian National Contract, the Wawa Company committed to transport a minimum of 3,600 rail carloads annually for the duration of the contract. If the Wawa Company does not meet these commitments, the Wawa Company is required to pay a penalty equal to CAD$1,000 per rail car. On February 20, 2017, Canadian National Railway Company filed a claim in Superior Court of the Province of Quebec District of Montreal against the Wawa Company and Rentech, Inc. for unpaid invoices related to the Canadian National Contract in the amount of approximately CAD$2.39 million as described in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in \u201cPart II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this report. Under the Canadian National Contract, Rentech, Inc. has guaranteed the Wawa Company\u2019s obligations in an amount not to exceed CAD$1.5 million.\nTo the extent that the commitments under the contracts described above have not been met, we may be required to pay additional penalties and other damages resulting from our failure to perform and the counterparties could seek other remedies, including termination of the contracts, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face competition from other wood fibre processing and wood pellet businesses.\nWe have a number of competitors in the wood fibre processing business in the United States and in other countries. Our wood chipping business\u2019s principal competitors include major domestic and foreign biomass supply companies and paper and pulp manufacturers, our industrial wood pellet business\u2019s principal competitors include major domestic and foreign biomass supply companies, and we have a number of competitors in our residential and commercial wood pellet business. Some competitors have greater total resources, or better name recognition, and are less dependent on earnings from those businesses, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent that we are not able to adapt or expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships or to the extent that potential customers view us an uncreditworthy contract counterparty. An inability to compete successfully in the wood fibre processing business could result in the loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. In addition, as a result of increased pricing pressures in the wood fibre processing business caused by competition, we may in the future experience reductions in our profit margins on sales, or may be unable to pass future input price increases on to our customers, which would reduce our cash flows.\nWe have experienced difficulties in constructing and ramping up production at our Canadian wood pellet facilities. We may face further difficulties in the future.\nWe have experienced difficulties in completing the construction of the Wawa Facility and Atikokan Facility, including significant cost overruns and delays. We have also experienced challenges increasing the production rate at both facilities toward their design capacities. As a result, we recently announced our decision to idle the Wawa Facility and to reduce production at the Atikokan Facility. In the event that we are unable to maintain consistent production rates at the Atikokan Facility, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur wood chipping business depends, in significant part, on continued demand from the board, paper, pulp and packaging industry. Any decline in demand for our services from this industry could have a negative impact on us.\nOur wood chipping business provides services to manufacturers of boxboard, container board, paper, pulp and similar products. Any decline in the industries in which these manufacturers participate could, in turn, have a negative impact on us. Some of the risks relating to this industry include:\n\u2022\nConsumption of writing and printing paper products has declined recently as a result of technological advances and the development of substitutes for paper products. The continuation of this trend could adversely impact our business in Chile and Uruguay that provides a significant amount of services to paper manufacturers; and\n\u2022\nIf the price of wood increases, this would negatively impact the businesses of our customers that supply wood to us for processing. Currently, all of our customers in the United States are responsible for the cost of wood used in our operations.\nIn the event that our wood chipping business experiences a decline as a result of these factors or otherwise, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTermination of the OPG Contract would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have entered into a ten year off take contract with OPG under which we are required to deliver 45,000 metric tons of wood pellets annually from our Atikokan Facility. Although we recently reduced our production at the Atikokan Facility to levels necessary\nonly to fulfill the delivery requirements under this contract, the OPG Contract constitutes a significant portion of our revenues. Under this contact, OPG has the right to terminate for specified reasons. For example, under the OPG Contract, OPG is permitted to terminate the contract in certain circumstances if the Atikokan Facility consistently fails to deliver pellets that are within required specifications or the required delivery schedule as agreed by the parties. Termination of the OPG Contract could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable changes in exchange rates could adversely affect us.\nWe are incurring expenses in Canadian dollars, and have contracted to sell our industrial wood pellets pursuant to off-take contracts under which the purchases are priced in Canadian dollars. As a result, we are subject to the effects of changing rates of exchange for the relevant currencies. Both the expenses we incur outside the United States and the value to our shareholders of future profits earned in foreign currencies may be affected by such exchange rates.\nFor financial statement reporting purposes, we translate the assets and liabilities of our Canadian subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date and translate their costs and expenses at the monthly average exchange rate during the period of the transaction. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Since we translate Canadian dollars into United States dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future.\nWe will rely primarily on Crown Fibre from the Government of Ontario for our feedstock needs at the Atikokan Facility. In the event that we lose the right to Crown Fibre or we are otherwise unable to secure adequate supplies of wood fibre on acceptable terms, this would likely materially adversely affect operations at the Atikokan Facility.\nWe use primarily Crown Fibre for the Atikokan Facility. Generally, obtaining Crown Fibre is a two-step process. First, the Government of Ontario must agree to make fibre available to us. At our Atikokan Facility, we intend to enter into an Agreement for the Supply of Crown Forest Resources in the near term pursuant to which the Government of Ontario would make available to us 279,400 cubic meters of Crown Fibre annually for a 10 year term. In the near term, we may rely on private purchases of mill residuals to provide fibre for our Atikokan Facility. There is no guarantee that the Government of Ontario will enter into or renew forest resource licenses as they expire. Further, there is no guarantee in the forest resource licenses or the Agreement for the Supply of Crown Forest Resources that the volumes contemplated therein will actually be available and the Government of Ontario reserves broad rights to modify and terminate such licenses and agreements.\nThe second step of our process for obtaining Crown Fibre is to enter into agreements with private parties that have existing rights over the forests from which the Government of Ontario has agreed to make Crown Fibre available to us. We expect that these agreements will provide us with the right to access and harvest or purchase the Crown Fibre made available to us by the Government of Ontario. While the private parties are statutorily required to make fibre available to parties such as us, the terms on which they make the fibre available may not be economical to us. As a result, we cannot assure you that will enter into such agreements on satisfactory terms or at all.\nIf the Government of Ontario ceases to make fibre available to us or we are unable to obtain the right to access and harvest or purchase Crown Fibre from the private parties on acceptable terms, we may experience shortages in wood fibre, which would adversely affect our levels of production. For instance, we experienced supply shortages at the Atikokan Facility late in 2015 and early 2016 due to challenges managing wood harvesters given delays in ramping up the facility. We also experienced supply shortages at the Wawa Facility late in 2016. It is possible that the Atikokan Facility could continue to see similar challenges managing wood harvesters supplying feedstock and experience supply shortages. In the event of an inability to obtain sufficient wood fibre from our principal sources, we may attempt to make open market purchases of wood fibre to satisfy the feedstock needs for our Atikokan Facility. However, there is no guarantee that we would be able to secure a sufficient supply of wood fibre on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to secure adequate supplies of wood fibre on acceptable terms, this would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to depend on third parties to deliver and harvest the timber we process at, and to transport the finished wood pellets from, our wood pellet facility in Canada.\nWe expect to contract with independent harvesting companies to harvest and deliver timber to our Atikokan Facility. Under the contracts, we expect that the harvesting companies will be responsible for all elements of harvesting and transporting timber to our wood pellet facility in Canada, including but not limited to building haul roads, surveying and block layout. The harvesting companies\u2019 ability to timely deliver timber to our facility could be adversely impacted by various factors, including but not limited to the inability to build necessary roads on time, employee strikes, weather conditions or traffic accidents. In the event that the harvesting\ncompanies fail to deliver timber to our facility on a timely basis, this would hinder our ability to produce wood pellets and, in turn, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe energy industry is highly competitive. Our wood pellet businesses may not successfully compete with other forms of energy.\nOur wood pellet businesses face intense competition from well-established, conventional forms of energy, including petroleum, coal and natural gas. These forms of energy are abundant and widely accepted by consumers, and we may not be able to successfully compete with them. If the price of these competing fuels declines as a result of the discovery of new deposits of oil, gas or coal or otherwise, this likely would weaken demand for our wood pellet products. Our wood pellet businesses also compete with other forms of renewable energy, many of which are developing and could attain greater market acceptance than electricity generated from wood pellets. Any failure of our wood pellet businesses to successfully compete with other forms of energy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for industrial wood pellets is dependent, in significant part, on government regulations over which we have no control.\nThe demand for industrial wood pellets for energy production is driven, in significant part, by governmental policies and incentives. For example, the European Union, or EU, has adopted legislation that includes certain climate and energy targets for the EU known as the \u201c20-20-20 target.\u201d This legislation aims to achieve the following targets by 2020: (i) a 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; (ii) an increase in the share of EU energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20%; and (iii) a 20% improvement in the EU\u2019s energy efficiency. The European Commission also has adopted the Communication \u201cEnergy Roadmap 2050\u201d renewing its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. As part of the Energy Roadmap 2050, the European Commission released the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy, which targets to reduce EU domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below the 1990 level by 2030 and to increase the share of renewable energy consumption to at least 27% by 2030. The UK has been an early adopter of these policies. The UK has adopted legislation targeting a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Through the launch of the Renewable Heat Incentive, the UK has also introduced a new payment system for the generation of heat from renewable sources. Moreover, the \u201cRenewables Obligation\u201d imposed by the UK in 2002 requires all electricity suppliers licensed in the UK to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of electricity from eligible renewable resources, or such suppliers will face a penalty. Under current law, the Renewables Obligation will remain in place through 2037. Some electricity suppliers are transitioning from more traditional fuel such as coal, which cost less than wood pellets, to using wood pellets as a feedstock to comply with this legislation and to receive the related incentives. These transitions would not occur in the absence of such legislation and related incentives. In the event that any of these or other similar governmental policies and incentives are modified or withdrawn, the demand for wood pellets would likely decrease significantly. Any such change in government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations. and cash flows\nOur wood fibre processing business is subject to environmental laws and regulations. We expect that the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will increase over time, and we could become subject to material environmental liabilities.\nOur wood fibre processing business is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment and the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous substances. These laws may include, in the United States, the CAA, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, TSCA, and various other federal, state and local laws and regulations, and other laws in Canada and other jurisdictions. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations or facility shutdowns. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations or other developments could require us to make additional expenditures. These expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations require permits and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws generally could result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. We may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. From time to time, we may also need to seek modifications to our permits, and delays in obtaining modifications or an inability to obtain modifications could similarly delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. In addition, as our wood fibre processing facilities ramp-up, emissions testing is required to determine compliance with our permits and applicable law. If the results of this testing indicate that emissions levels exceed applicable thresholds, we could be required to curtail or reduce operations or install pollution control equipment.\nOur business, and the real property on which it is operated, also is subject to spills, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment. We could be held liable for past or future releases at or migrating beneath the real property where we have operated, or the real property currently or formerly owned or leased by us, even if we did not cause the release or own, operate or lease the real property when the release occurred. Past or future spills related to our facilities or transportation of products or hazardous substances from our facilities may give rise to liability (including strict liability, or liability without fault, and potential clean-up responsibility) to governmental entities or private parties under federal, state or local environmental laws, as well as under common law. For example, we could be held strictly liable under CERCLA, for past or future spills without regard to fault or whether our actions were in compliance with the law at the time of the spills. Pursuant to CERCLA and similar state statutes, we could be held liable for contamination associated with our facilities, facilities we formerly owned or operated (if any) and facilities to which we transported or arranged for the transportation of wastes or by-products containing hazardous substances for treatment, storage or disposal. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, liability to third parties for damage to their property or exposure to hazardous substances, or the need to address newly discovered information or conditions that may require response actions could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\nOur operations in non-United States jurisdictions are subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the United States, and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under United States law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-United States jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if United States law governed these operations.\nOur wood fibre processing and sales operations in Chile and Uruguay face additional risks.\nFulghum has four wood processing mills in Chile and one in Uruguay. We also sell wood chips and biomass fuel in Chile. Our operations in Chile and Uruguay expose us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe purchase wood to support the export of chips from Chile. As a result, this business is subject to risks related to the supply and cost of wood. See \u201cPart II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk\u201d included in this report.\n\u2022\nBecause they are located in locations more distant to us than our operations in the United States, we may have greater difficulty overseeing manufacturing operations at our wood processing mills in Chile and Uruguay.\n\u2022\nIf an adverse change in local, political, economic, social or labor conditions, or tax or other laws, occurs in Chile or Uruguay, our operations in those countries could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nWe may have greater difficulty hiring personnel needed to oversee our operations in Chile and Uruguay.\n\u2022\nOur operations in Chile and Uruguay could expose us to risks relating to longer payment cycles, increased credit risk, higher levels of payment fraud or unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\u2022\nOur operations in Chile and Uruguay could expose us to risks relating to foreign laws and legal systems, some of which are still developing.\n\u2022\nOur operations in Chile and Uruguay could expose us to risks relating to different employee/employer relationships, existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.\nIf any of these risks materialize or worsen, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of our wood pellet business. In addition, NEWP\u2019s business is seasonal, and events occurring during seasons in which revenues for this business are typically higher may disproportionately affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse weather conditions have historically and in the future could continue to negatively impact sales of NEWP\u2019s wood pellets and the processing of our industrial, residential and commercial wood pellets. Weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for wood pellets. Because NEWP supplies distributors whose customers depend on heating fuel during the winter, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in one or more regions in which NEWP operates can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross margin realized on those sales. Warmer temperatures in the Northeast could have a\nparticularly adverse impact on sales, since almost all of NEWP\u2019s wood pellets are consumed in that region. A reduction in the total volume we sell or in the gross margin we realize on such sales would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. To accommodate the seasonality in sales, NEWP typically builds inventory during the months of March through August, which increases its working capital requirements during those months of the year. As a result of the seasonality in its business, NEWP\u2019s revenues, results of operations and net working capital will vary from quarter to quarter.\nIn addition, colder weather during the winter months could adversely impact our ability to process and pelletize wood for our industrial and residential wood pellet facilities. Weather and weather changes have an impact on our production efficiencies. Colder weather during winter months may adversely impact the processing of wood (particle sizing and drying) prior to pelletizing. Significant moisture from rain and snow may also adversely impact the drying of wood and increase the costs of drying wood fuel. Production process changes such as moisture content, particle sizing, and pelletizing die size may be needed when weather climate conditions change, all of which may adversely affect the processing and pelletizing of wood. A decrease in production efficiencies would increase our production costs. Further, the lower cost of competitive fuels that customers use in the winter months to heat their homes, such as heating oil, could negatively impact sales for NEWP. A reduction in the gross margin we realize on such sales would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to our dependence on significant customers, the loss of one or more of such significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNEWP depends on significant customers, and the loss of one or several of such significant customers may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. In the aggregate, NEWP\u2019s top two big-box retailers, Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement and Tractor Supply Company, represented about 25% of NEWP\u2019s total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. As is typical in the wood pellet industry, NEWP\u2019s sales to big-box retailers are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and NEWP generally does not have long-term orders or commitments from our big-box retailers. As a result, we are limited in our ability to predict the level of future sales or commitments from our current customers. If our sales to any of our significant customers were to decline, we may not be able to find other customers to purchase the excess supply of NEWP\u2019s products. The loss of one or several of our significant customers of our wood pellet products, or a significant reduction in purchase volume by any of them, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFulghum also depends on significant customers, as certain of its customers own multiple mills for which Fulghum provides processing services. As a result, the loss of any one customer may result in the loss of multiple mills for which Fulghum is contracted to provide services. During 2016, approximately 71% of the log volume we processed in the United States was for four customers at 19 mills, and in early 2017 we lost contracts for two mills that were owned by a single customer representing 19% of the log volume processed in the United States in 2016. If Fulghum were to lose one or several customers that owned multiple mills there would be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Market for Rentech Common Stock\nIf we fail to continue to meet the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. To remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, we must maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to fall below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC could notify us of our potential delisting. If we were to receive such a notification, we would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock would need to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. As of March 30, 2017, the bid price for shares of our common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market was $0.50 per share. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable NASDAQ Stock Market listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock, in which case our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nWe have a substantial overhang of common stock and future sales of our common stock or of securities linked to our common stock may cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our shares.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 23.2 million shares of our common stock outstanding. As of that date, an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock were issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted stock units, performance stock units, options and warrants. In the event that we acquire companies or assets, we may issue additional shares of stock to acquire those companies or assets.\nThe sale of common stock and common stock equivalents in material amounts may be necessary to finance the progress of our business plan and operations. Certain future holders of our securities may be granted rights to participate in or to require us to file registration statements with the SEC for resale of common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of other securities), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 76978, "SIC": 2400, "TIC": "RTKHQ"}
