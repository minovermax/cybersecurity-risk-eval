RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe recently completed acquisition of Lifetouch, Inc. (\"Lifetouch\") presents many risks and we may not realize our anticipated financial and strategic goals.\nOn April 2, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Lifetouch, the national leader in school photography. Risks we may face in connection with the acquisition of Lifetouch include:\n\u2022We may not realize the benefits we expect to receive from the transaction, such as anticipated synergies, increasing revenue and enhanced financial position;\n\u2022We may have difficulties managing the acquired company\u2019s technologies and lines of business; or entering into a new business where we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022The acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not successfully integrate Lifetouch as planned, there could be unanticipated adverse impacts on Lifetouch\u2019s business, or we may not otherwise realize the expected return on our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we record as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022Our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1) claims or liabilities that we assume from Lifetouch including, among others, claims from government agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers or business partners, former employee stock ownership plan (ESOP Plan) participants or other third parties; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships of Lifetouch that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (3) unfavorable accounting treatment as a result of Lifetouch\u2019s practices; and (4) intellectual property claims or disputes;\n\u2022Our ability to successfully manage the various Lifetouch businesses, which operate in a more decentralized manner than Shutterfly, and, in particular, the sales territory organization structure;\n\u2022Lifetouch was a privately-held company and has not been required to maintain an internal control infrastructure that would meet the standards of a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The implementation of such controls may impair business operations, the costs that we may incur to implement such controls and procedures may be substantial and we could encounter unexpected delays and challenges in this implementation. In addition, we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of Lifetouch\u2019s financial and disclosure controls and procedures and any of these things could impact our ability to timely file our periodic reports;\n\u2022Lifetouch\u2019s large workforce means greater compliance burden and increased risks of class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and potential claims or audits from governmental agencies;\n\u2022We may fail to find and retain enough qualified seasonal employees given an increase in competition;\n\u2022We may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances existing prior to acquiring Lifetouch, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition; and\n\u2022We may have difficulty incorporating Lifetouch\u2019s related supply chain operations with our existing supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur net revenue, operating results and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.\nOur business is highly seasonal, with a high proportion of our net revenue, net income and operating cash flows generated during the fourth quarter for both our Shutterfly consumer business and our Lifetouch business. For example, we generated approximately 50% of our net revenue in the fourth quarter during each of the last three years in our Shutterfly consumer business and Lifetouch generated approximately 35% of its net revenue in the fourth calendar quarter during each of the last three years. In addition, we incur significant additional expenses in the period leading up to Shutterfly's fourth quarter holiday season and Lifetouch's third quarter fall school portrait season and retail holiday season (our peak times), including expenses\nrelated to the hiring and training of temporary workers to meet our seasonal needs, additional inventory and equipment purchases, and increased advertising. We face intense competition for seasonal and temporary workers; with respect to Lifetouch\u2019s seasonal photographers, this difficulty may be exacerbated now that the ESOP has been terminated. If we are unable to accurately forecast expense levels, our results of operations would likely be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products during the fourth quarter, or if there is a meaningful decrease in demand for Lifetouch fall school photo day during the third quarter, our financial results, reputation and brands will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nWe also base our operating expense budgets on expected net revenue trends. A portion of our expenses, such as office, production facility, and various equipment leases and personnel costs, are largely fixed and are based on our expectations of our peak levels of operations. In addition, we must effectively manage the ramp-up and ramp-down of variable labor to achieve our expectations. Failure to accurately forecast or ineffectively manage such spikes can result in unexpected revenue or operating income shortfall. Accordingly, any shortfall in net revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter, particularly in the third and fourth quarters\nIf we are unable to meet our production requirements, our net revenue and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe believe that we must continue to upgrade and expand our current production capability to meet our projected net revenue targets. Our capital expenditures were approximately 5%, 6% and 8% of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The expenditures will continue to increase with the Lifetouch acquisition. Operational difficulties, such as a significant interruption in the operations of our production facilities or in facilities operated by third-parties, could delay production or shipment of our products. In addition, inclement weather, particularly heavy rain and snow could impair our production capabilities. Our inability to meet our production requirements, particularly in our peak season, could lead to customer dissatisfaction, impact Lifetouch's account retention, and damage our reputation and brands, which would result in reduced net revenue. Moreover, if the costs of meeting production requirements, including capital expenditures, were to exceed our expectations, our results of operations would be harmed.\nIn addition, at peak times, we face significant production risks, including the risk of obtaining sufficient qualified seasonal production personnel. Most of our workforce during these periods has historically been comprised of seasonal, temporary personnel. We have had difficulties in the past finding and retaining enough qualified seasonal employees, and our failure to find and retain qualified seasonal production personnel at any of our production facilities could harm our operations.\nUncertainties in general economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns, particularly in the personalized products and photofinishing services categories, could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur financial performance depends on general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending in the United States, particularly on personalized products and photofinishing services and professional photography and in Canada on Lifetouch's school business. Shutterfly consumer net revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was 49% in 2018, 84% in 2017 and 88% in 2016; substantially all of Lifetouch\u2019s revenue was derived from consumers during these periods. Some of the macroeconomic conditions that can adversely affect consumer spending levels in the United States include domestic and foreign stock market volatility and its effects on net worth, anticipated economic slowdowns in foreign economies, high consumer debt levels, uncertainty in real estate markets and home values, fluctuating energy and commodity costs, rising or higher than average interest rates, higher than usual unemployment rates, limited credit availability, changes in tax laws, and general uncertainty about the future economic environment. If general economic conditions decline, customers or potential customers could delay, reduce or forego their purchases of our products and services, which are discretionary. Any decrease in the demand for our products and services could impact our business several ways, including lower prices for our products and services and reduced sales. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to price increases by our suppliers or increase our operating expenses due to, among other factors, higher costs of labor, energy, equipment and facilities which could in turn lead to additional restructuring actions by us and associated expenses. We may not be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers due to the macroeconomic environment and the resulting increased expenses and/or reduced income could have a material adverse impact our operating results.\nCompetitive pricing pressures, particularly with respect to pricing and shipping, may harm our business and results of operations.\nDemand for our products and services is sensitive to price, especially in times of slow or uncertain economic growth and consumer conservatism. Many factors can significantly impact our pricing strategies, including production and personnel costs,\nand others outside of our control, such as consumer sentiment and our competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies. If we fail to meet our customers\u2019 price expectations, we could lose customers, which would harm our business and results of operations.\nChanges in our pricing strategies have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our net revenue and net income. For example, in the second and third quarters of 2018 we saw a deceleration of revenue associated with free promotions that impacted our top line consumer revenue. As we continue to implement more optimized and targeted pricing strategies, we cannot predict with certainty that these changes will have the expected impacts. From time to time, we have made changes to our pricing structure to remain competitive. Many of our products, including professionally-bound photo books, calendars, cards and stationery and other photo merchandise are also offered by our competitors. Many of our competitors discount those products at significant levels and as a result, we may be compelled to change our discounting strategy, which could impact our acquisition of new customers, average order value, net revenue, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA and net income profitability measures. If in the future, due to competitor discounting or other marketing strategies, we significantly reduce our prices on our products without a corresponding increase in volume, it would negatively impact our net revenue and could adversely affect our gross margins and overall profitability.\nWe generate a significant portion of our net revenue from the fees we collect from shipping and handling of our products. For example, shipping and handling revenue for the Shutterfly brand website represented approximately 22% of our net revenue in 2018, 23% of our net revenue in 2017 and 19% in 2016. We also offer discounted or free shipping, with a minimum purchase requirement, during promotional periods to acquire and retain customers. If free shipping offers extend beyond a limited number of occasions, are not based upon a minimum purchase requirement or become commonplace, our net revenue and results of operations would be negatively impacted. In addition, we occasionally offer free or discounted products and services to acquire and retain customers. In the future, if we increase these offers to respond to actions taken by our competitors, our results of operations may be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from a range of competitors and may be unsuccessful in competing against current and future competitors.\nThe digital photography products and services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors improve their offerings, including developing, acquiring and expanding mobile and cloud-based offerings, and as new participants enter the market or as industry consolidation further develops. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or loss of market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. For example, we saw a significantly greater marketing presence and more aggressive promotional activity from competitors in the fourth quarter in 2018 as compared to recent years, with competition both at the value and premium ends of the spectrum. We face intense competition from a wide range of companies, including the following:\n\u2022Online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish, Vistaprint, and many others;\n\u2022Social media companies that host and enable mobile access to and posting of images such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat and Google+;\n\u2022Photo hosting websites that allow users to upload and share images at no cost such as Apple iCloud, Google Photos, and Flickr;\n\u2022\u201cBig Box\u201d retailers such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, Target, and others that offer low cost digital photography products and services. In addition to providing low-cost competitive product offerings on their respective websites, these competitors provide in-store fulfillment and self-service kiosks for printing, and may, among other strategies, offer their customers heavily discounted in-store products and services that compete directly with our offerings;\n\u2022Drug stores such as Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, and others that offer low-cost photography products and services as well as in-store pick-up from their photo website Internet orders;\n\u2022Traditional offline stationery companies such as PaperSource, Crane & Co., and Papyrus;\n\u2022Cloud-based storage services and file-syncing services such as Dropbox, Box, Everalbum, Amazon Photos and iCloud;\n\u2022Specialized companies in the photo book and stationery business such as Hallmark, Cardstore by American Greetings, Minted, Invitations by Dawn, Picaboo, Blurb, Mixbook, Postable, Artifact Uprising and Chatbooks;\n\u2022Photo-related software companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe;\n\u2022Online and offline companies specializing in photo-based merchandise and personalized home d\u00e9cor such as Zazzle, CafePress, Art.Com, Canvas On Demand, Personalization Mall, Personal Creations, Things Remembered, Mark &amp; Graham, CustomInk, Teespring and Etsy.\n\u2022Providers of digital alternatives to our products, such as Paperless Post, Evite, Animoto, and PicCollage.\n\u2022Home printing service providers such as Hewlett-Packard and Epson that are seeking to expand their printer and ink businesses by gaining market share in the digital photography marketplace;\n\u2022Enterprise digital and print communications companies such as RR Donnelley and Sons Company, O'Neil Data Systems, Inc., Quad/Graphics, Inc. and Viatech Publishing Solutions, Inc.;\n\u2022Regional photography companies such as Ritz Camera that have established brands and customer bases in existing photography markets;\n\u2022Camera and photographic supply companies that rent equipment nationwide both online and in brick-and-mortar stores such as LensRentals.com, Cameralends, AbelCine, and Adorama;\n\u2022Picture People and Portrait Innovations in the Lifetouch portrait studio business;\n\u2022Independent professional and amateur photographers who enjoy low barriers to entry and can offer flexible business terms and product options in the school photography, church photography and retail studio photography businesses;\n\u2022Primarily local and regional players that compete with the Lifetouch School photography business, including Inter-State Studio & Publishing, Barksdale School Portraits, Strawbridge Studios and Dorian Studio in the United States and Artona Group, Edge Imaging, Mountain West Studios and Pegasus School Images in Canada; and\n\u2022Jostens, Herff Jones, Balfour and Walsworth Publishing in yearbooks (all of whom have made significant investments in technology) in addition to several online yearbook providers such as Tree Ring and Picaboo.\nMany of our competitors, particularly in the Shutterfly Consumer and SBS segments, have significantly longer operating histories; larger and broader customer bases, greater brand and name recognition; greater financial, research and development and distribution resources, and operate in more geographic areas than we do. Well-funded competitors may be better able to withstand economic downturns and periods of slow economic growth and the associated periods of reduced customer spending and increased pricing pressures. The numerous choices for digital photography services can cause confusion for consumers and may cause them to select a competitor with greater name recognition. Some competitors can devote substantially more resources to website and systems development or to investments or partnerships with traditional and online competitors. Well-funded competitors, particularly new entrants, may choose to prioritize growing their market share and brand awareness instead of profitability. Competitors and new entrants in the digital photography products and services industry may develop new products, technologies or capabilities that could render obsolete or less competitive many of our products, services and content. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures could harm our business and prospects\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate, which may lead to volatility in our stock price.\nOur future revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are difficult for us to predict and control. Factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022demand for our products and services, including seasonal demand;\n\u2022our success in executing our pricing, market and general business strategy;\n\u2022our ability to attract visitors to our websites, convert those visitors into customers and encourage repeat purchases;\n\u2022the amount and timing of our operating and capital expenses;\n\u2022our ability to manage our production and fulfillment operations;\n\u2022the costs to produce our prints and photo-based products and merchandise to provide our services;\n\u2022the costs of expanding or enhancing our technology or websites;\n\u2022a significant increase in returns and credits, beyond our estimated allowances, for customers who are not satisfied with our products;\n\u2022the slower secular growth of our core-paper based products business, including the increasing commodification in the Prints business;\n\u2022decreases in travel, including declines or disruptions to the travel industry and variations in weather, particularly heavy rain and snow which tend to depress travel and picture taking;\n\u2022the potential impact of the current U.S political climate on consumer spending;\n\u2022the timing of holidays and the duration of the holiday shopping season which will be shorter in 2019 than it was in 2018;\n\u2022natural disasters or other events resulting in school closures could lead to cancellations or postponements of scheduled picture days, and could also impact Lifetouch\u2019s school business operations in the field and/or production facilities;\n\u2022our ability to achieve the expected benefits of strategic partnerships or the loss of any such partnership;\n\u2022our ability to address increased shipping delays caused by our third-party shippers' inability to handle the ever-increasing number of consumers ordering goods online, particularly during the holiday shopping season;\n\u2022volatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022the deterioration of our business relationships with our Lifetouch hosts, including schools, preschools, and other organizations as well as retailers like JCPenney;\n\u2022general economic conditions, including recession and slow economic growth in the United States and worldwide and higher inflation;\n\u2022consumer preferences for digital photography services;\n\u2022improvements to the quality, cost and convenience of desktop printing of digital pictures and products;\n\u2022continued decline in church or house of worship attendance which impact Lifetouch\u2019s church division; and\n\u2022global and geopolitical events with indirect economic effects such as pandemic disease, hurricane and other natural disasters, war, threat of war or terrorist actions.\nBased on the factors cited above, and in light of the seasonal nature of our business, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. It is possible that in one or more future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of public analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nThere can be no assurance that our exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being consummated, and speculation and uncertainty regarding the outcome of our exploration of strategic alternatives may adversely impact our business.\nOn February 5, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has formed a Strategic Review Committee and retained Morgan Stanley as financial advisor, as it continues an ongoing review of strategic and financial alternatives. The Strategic Review Committee is also evaluating the Company\u2019s capital structure and capital return policy. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be consummated, and the process of exploring strategic and financial alternatives will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. In addition, speculation and uncertainty regarding our exploration of strategic and financial alternatives may cause or result in:\n\u2022 disruption of our business;\n\u2022 distraction of our management and employees;\n\u2022 difficulty in recruiting, hiring, motivating, and retaining talented and skilled personnel;\n\u2022 difficulty in maintaining or negotiating and consummating new, business or strategic relationships or transactions;\n\u2022 increased stock price volatility; and\n\u2022 increased costs and advisory fees.\nIf we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by our exploration of strategic and financial alternatives, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results, and financial condition.\nTo be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, hire, integrate, retain and motivate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining highly-skilled senior management, technical, marketing and production personnel are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. Additionally, the current uncertainty around U.S. immigration rules could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We face significant competition for qualified personnel in all locations where we operate, including in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located and in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, where our Lifetouch principal office is located. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who can meet our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay increased compensation to do so. Failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, a lack of management continuity could result in operational, technological, and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and stock price and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees and senior executives could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We hired a new Chief Marketing Officer in October 2018. On February 5, 2019, we announced that Christopher North, our President, Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board, will be stepping down at the end of August 2019. We currently have not hired a replacement Chief Executive Officer. Our search process, which is being led by the Board, to identify a candidate for Chief Executive Officer continues, and we continue to work with an executive search firm to assist with the process of identifying, evaluating and recruiting candidates. There are no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of our search for a new Chief Executive Officer. Our ability to execute our business strategies, ensure a cohesive management team,\nand attract and retain key executives may be adversely affected by the uncertainty associated with the transition to a successor President and Chief Executive Officer.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may not be able to sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have periodically experienced operating losses since our inception in 1999. In particular, we make investments in our business that generally result in operating losses in each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year. This typically has enabled us to generate the majority of our net revenue during the fourth quarter and to achieve profitability for the full fiscal year. If we are unable to produce our products and provide our services at commercially reasonable costs, if consumer demand decreases and net revenue decline or if our expenses exceed our expectations, we may not be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe face many risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties relating to increasing our market share and growing our business.\nTo address the risks and uncertainties of increasing our market share and growing our business, we must do the following:\n\u2022 maintain and increase the size of our customer base;\n\u2022 increase the number of schools and preschools we serve;\n\u2022 maintain and enhance our brands;\n\u2022 enhance and expand our products and services;\n\u2022 continue to develop and upgrade our technology and information processing systems, including our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system;\n\u2022 increase the participation rate at Lifetouch\n\u2022 maintain and grow our websites, applications and customer operations;\n\u2022 successfully execute our business and marketing strategy;\n\u2022 continue to enhance our service to meet the needs of a changing industry;\n\u2022 provide a high-quality customer experience, including superior customer service and timely product deliveries;\n\u2022 respond to competitive developments; and\n\u2022 attract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe may be unable to accomplish one or more of these requirements, which could cause our business to suffer. Accomplishing one or more of these requirements might be very expensive, which could harm our financial results.\nIf we are unable to acquire customers, or do so in a cost-effective manner, traffic to our websites would be reduced and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract customers and grow our active customer base, specifically in a cost-effective manner. On a net basis, our active customer base for Shutterfly Consumer has been relatively flat for the past three years. We rely on a variety of methods to bring visitors to our websites and mobile applications and promote our products, including paying fees to third parties who drive new customers to our websites and mobile applications, purchasing search results from online search engines, e-mail and direct mail marketing campaigns. We pay providers of online services, search engines, social media, advertising networks, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses to provide content, advertising/media and other links that direct customers to our websites. We also use e-mail and direct mail to attract customers, and we offer substantial pricing discounts or free products to encourage repeat purchases and trial orders. For Lifetouch, our marketing efforts also include flyers distributed by our hosts, radio advertising and television advertising. Our methods of attracting customers, including acquiring customer lists from third parties can involve substantial costs, regardless of whether we acquire new customers as a result of such purchases. Even if we are successful in acquiring and retaining customers, the cost involved in these efforts, and which has increased in recent years, especially as we shift our sales offerings from free to paid products, impacts our results of operations. Customer lists are typically recorded as intangible assets and may be subject to impairment charges if the fair value of that list exceeds its carrying value. These potential impairment charges could harm our results from operations. If we are unable to enhance or maintain the methods we use to reach consumers, if the costs of acquiring customers using these methods significantly increase, or if we are unable to develop new cost-effective methods to obtain customers, our ability to attract new customers would be harmed, traffic to our websites and mobile applications may be reduced and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur sales to SBS customers can be unpredictable, can require significant ramp-up periods in the early stages of SBS contracts, and a decrease in SBS revenue or an increase in costs of SBS net revenue could adversely impact total net revenue and profit levels.\nSBS revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was 12% in 2018, 16% in 2017 and 12% in 2016. SBS gross margins were 19% in 2018, 20% in 2017 and 26% in 2016. The declining gross margins of this segment, coupled with the increasing percentage of total revenue from SBS, may magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our operating results. This may have an adverse effect on our overall margins and profitability. Our SBS revenue is highly concentrated in a small number of customers and the loss of, or reduction in volume from, one or more of our SBS customers could decrease SBS revenue and adversely impact our total net revenue. Our SBS customers also come from a variety of industries, often creating regulatory compliance issues for us as well as the need to maintain security for third-party data. These SBS customers also demand strict security requirements and specified service levels. If we fail to meet these service levels, we may not only lose an SBS customer, but may have to pay punitive costs for such failures. As our SBS business grows, issues that impact our sales to SBS customers may have a negative impact on our total sales. Our core business is consumer focused and we have less experience managing sales to SBS customers and may not sell as successfully to SBS customers, who often have long sales cycles, long implementation periods and significant upfront costs. In addition, we had in 2017 and 2018, and may continue to have in the future, low or no gross margins in the early stages of our contracts with SBS customers that often require significant ramp-up periods, which will adversely affect our total net revenue. To compete effectively in the SBS industry, we have in the past, and may in the future, be forced to offer significant discounts to large SBS customers at lower margins or reduce or withdraw from existing relationships with smaller SBS customers, which could negatively impact our net revenue and could adversely affect our gross margins and overall profitability.\nIf we are unable to adequately control the costs associated with operating our business, our results of operations will suffer.\nThe primary costs in operating our business are related to producing and shipping products, acquiring customers, compensating our personnel, acquiring equipment and technology, and leasing facilities. Controlling our business costs is challenging because many of the factors that impact these costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs to produce prints, such as the costs of photographic print paper, could increase due to a shortage of silver or an increase in worldwide energy, oil or fuel prices. Higher fuel prices have a corresponding increase in travel-related expenses of our Lifetouch photographers. Changes in federal and state minimum wage laws could raise the wage requirements for certain of our seasonal personnel, which could increase the pressure, particularly on Lifetouch, in hiring seasonal photographers and production workers; we may also experience competitive pressure to increase the wages paid to a large population of our employees resulting from other industry participants increasing wage levels. In addition, we may become subject to increased costs by the third-party shippers that deliver our products to our customers, and we may be unable to pass along any increases in shipping costs to our customers. The costs of online advertising and keyword search could also increase significantly due to increased competition, which would increase our customer acquisition costs. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our production facilities, the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating our production facilities. If we are unable to keep the costs associated with operating our business aligned with the level of net revenue that we generate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to reliably meet our technology, data storage and management requirements, it may harm customer satisfaction, net revenue, costs and brand reputation.\nAs a part of our current consumer business model, we offer our customers free unlimited online storage and sharing of images and, as a result, must store and manage many petabytes of data. This policy results in immense system requirements and substantial ongoing technological challenges, both of which are expected to continue to increase over time. We continuously evaluate our short and long-term data storage capacity requirements to enable adequate capacity and management for new and existing customers. We strive to predict the capacity requirements as tightly as possible as overestimating may negatively impact our capital needs and underestimating may impact the level and quality of service we provide to our customers, which could harm customer satisfaction, net revenue, costs and brand reputation.\nAn increasing number of our customers are using smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices to order products and access services. If we are unable to develop mobile applications that are adopted by our customers or if we are unable to generate net revenue from our mobile applications, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access information about our services and our websites through mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or computers, has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue\nincreasing. As part of our multichannel strategy, we are making technology investments in our mobile websites and our iOS and Android applications. If customers do not adopt our applications and mobile website as expected, or if we are generally unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing mobile technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete could be adversely affected and may result in the loss of market share, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, if our technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of confidence, data security breaches or lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. As new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing products and applications for these alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such products and applications. If we experience difficulties providing satisfactory access to our services via our mobile applications and mobile websites, such as, problems with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems (e.g., Apple or Google and their application stores) our growth and customer acquisition and retention capabilities may be impaired. In addition, increased distribution costs of the applications may impact net revenue growth and negative reviews due to our software and user experience may damage our brand reputation and lead to customer churn.\nComputer system capacity constraints and system failures could significantly degrade the quality of our services, such as access to our websites or mobile applications, and in-turn cause customer loss, damage to our reputation and negatively affect our net revenue.\nOur business requires that we have adequate capacity in our computer systems to cope with the periodic high volume of visits to our websites and mobile applications. As our operations grow in size and scope, we continually need to improve and upgrade our computer systems, data storage, and network infrastructure to enable reliable access to our websites and mobile applications, in order to offer customers enhanced and new products, services, capacity, features and functionality. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of our business increases, with no assurance that our net revenue will increase to offset these additional expenses.\nPortions of our infrastructure, especially our photos domain for Shutterfly Photos, have run on a public cloud service (Amazon Web Services, Inc. or \"AWS\") for several years. Since the third quarter of 2017, Shutterfly has added additional workloads to AWS thereby expanding the portions of our infrastructure which run on a public cloud service, and we intend to continue to expand our use of AWS. Any disturbances in the AWS system may create unforeseen technical issues, which would negatively influence our business and reputation. Although we leverage the redundancy features available from our public cloud service provider, any outage to their infrastructure could adversely impact our site availability, potentially leading to poor customer experience and data loss. For instance, in December 2017, researchers identified significant CPU architecture vulnerabilities commonly known as \u201cSpectre\u201d and \u201cMeltdown\u201d that required AWS software updates and patches to mitigate such vulnerabilities and such updates and patches required AWS servers to be offline and slowed their performance.\nOur ability to provide high-quality products and service depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications, data storage and network infrastructure systems. If our systems cannot be scaled in a timely manner to cope with increased website and mobile applications traffic, we could experience disruptions in service, slower response times, lower customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new products and services. Any of these problems could harm our reputation and cause our net revenue to decline.\nFull or partial outages to our websites, mobile applications, computer systems, print production processes or customer service operations could damage our brand reputation and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our websites and mobile applications, information technology systems, printing production processes and customer service operations are critical to our service delivery, customer acquisition and retention and brand reputation growth. Any service interruptions that degrade the satisfactory use of our websites and mobile applications due to undetected bugs, design faults or poor scalability, may impact customer growth and retention, net revenue and costs. These include (but are not limited to) our product creation experience, order fulfillment performance, customer service operations and security of our systems.\nThis risk is heightened in the fourth quarter, as we experience significantly increased traffic to our websites during the holiday season and significantly higher order volumes. Any interruption that occurs during such time would have a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations than if it occurred during a different quarter. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, a technical issue in our newly built shopping cart service caused a partial outage that prevented some customers from placing orders on Cyber Monday. Even after the issue was identified and corrected, many of those orders were not received by customers within the expected time frame. As a result, we refunded many of those orders\nwhich reduced net revenue, recognized excess costs related to expedited shipping upgrades, and increased customer service costs which negatively impacted our gross margins and our brand.\nWe depend in part on third parties to implement and maintain certain aspects of our Internet and communications infrastructure and printing systems. Therefore, many of the causes of system interruptions or interruptions in the production process may be outside of our control. As a result, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner, or at all. Our business interruption insurance policies do not address all potential causes of business interruptions that we may experience, and any proceeds we may receive from these policies in the event of a business interruption may not fully compensate us for the net revenue we may lose.\nAny failure by us to protect the confidential information of our customers and employees, and our networks against security breaches and the risks associated with credit card fraud could damage our reputation and brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nA significant prerequisite to e-commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We may be subject to cyber-attacks, phishing attacks, malicious software programs, and other attacks in the future. These attacks may come from individual hackers, criminal groups, and state-sponsored organizations. Our failure to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation and brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations. Even though we do not store customer credit cards on our computer system and use third-party systems to clear transactions, in case of an outage to a third-party system, we will temporarily store and bill our customers\u2019 credit card accounts directly; orders are then shipped to a customer\u2019s address and customers log on using their e-mail address. We rely on encryption and authentication technologies licensed from third parties to affect the secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, hacking or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user\u2019s password could access the user\u2019s transaction data, personal information or stored images. In addition to these threats, the security, integrity, and availability of our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 data, including student photos, could be compromised by employee negligence, error or malfeasance, and technology defects. For example, due to the current status of Lifetouch\u2019s customer contact processes, there is risk of providing photo access to the wrong customer, which could lead to loss of business with school districts and lead to brand reputation damage.\nOur expanded use of cloud-based services could also increase the risk of security breaches as cyber-attacks on cloud environments are increasing to almost the same level as attacks on traditional information technology systems. For example, in 2014, we experienced a cyber-attack on our Tiny Prints, Treat and Wedding Paper Divas websites, which may have exposed the email addresses and encrypted passwords used by our customers to login to their accounts. We encrypt customer credit and debit card information, and we have no evidence that such information was compromised; however, any compromise of our security could damage our reputation and brands and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which would substantially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, anyone who can circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Additionally, in 2018, we discovered that there had been unauthorized access to an internal testing environment, which could have resulted in exposure of employee confidential data. Although we discovered no evidence to indicate exposure of this data, we cannot determine that it did not occur; while we have taken remediation and precautionary measures to prevent this type of situation from occurring again, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective.\nIn addition, contractors we hire as well as other employees have access to confidential information, including credit card and employee data. Although we take steps to limit this access, this data could be compromised by these contractors or other employee personnel. Under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder\u2019s signature. We do not currently carry insurance against this risk. To date, we have experienced minimal losses from credit card fraud, but we continue to face the risk of significant losses from this type of fraud. Our failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions and use of confidential information would damage our reputation and brands, and substantially harm our business and result of operations.\nIf the third-party vendors who we depend upon to purchase our supplies, market our products, produce many of our products or deliver our product fail to perform under our agreements with them or experience delays or interruptions in service, our customer experience will suffer, which would substantially harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur ability to provide a high-quality customer experience depends, in large part, on external factors over which we may have little or no control, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, third-party product providers and shipping partners. For example, some of our products, such as select photo-based merchandise, are produced and shipped to customers by our third-party vendors, and we rely on these vendors to properly inspect and ship these products. We purchase photo-based and other product supplies and photography equipment from third parties. These parties could increase their prices, reallocate supply to others, including our competitors, or choose to terminate their relationship with us. Furthermore, if any of our third-party suppliers are unable to produce our products, we could have difficulty finding an alternative producer in a timely manner. In the third quarter of 2018, a third-party supplier unexpectedly shut down, which combined with Hurricane Michael, affected the ability of another third-party supplier that had absorbed the increased capacity to meet our production needs during peak times. In addition, we rely on third-party shippers, including the U.S. Postal Service and UPS to deliver our products to customers. Strikes, furloughs, reduced operations, increased shipping delays particularly during the holiday shopping season, or other service interruptions affecting these shippers could impair our ability to deliver merchandise on a timely basis. We also currently outsource some of our off-line and online marketing, and some of our customer service activities to third parties. In the fourth quarter of 2015, a third-party customer service provider experienced a disruption that affected our operations during peak times. Our failure to provide customers with high-quality products in a timely manner for any reason or a failure to meet customer expectations could substantially harm our reputation and our efforts to develop trusted brands, which would substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nLifetouch\u2019s studio business is materially dependent upon JCPenney and any deterioration in Lifetouch\u2019s relationships with JCPenney or in JCPenney\u2019s business could have a material adverse effect on Lifetouch\u2019s revenue.\nSubstantially all of Lifetouch\u2019s studio business is derived from sales in JCPenney stores and is, therefore, materially dependent upon its relationship with JCPenney, the continued goodwill of JCPenney and the integrity of their brand names in the retail marketplace. In January 2019, JCPenney announced it would be closing three stores by the spring with additional closures potentially announced throughout the year. Lifetouch\u2019s portrait studios in JCPenney leverage customer traffic generated by the JCPenney retail stores, and if the customer traffic through these stores decreases due to the weakness of the JCPenney business, further store closures, JCPenney chooses not to renew its agreement with us, general economic conditions or for any other reason, Lifetouch\u2019s sales could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the facility where our computer and communications hardware is located fails or if any of our production facilities fail, our business and results of operations would be harmed, and our reputation could be damaged.\nOur ability to successfully receive and fulfill orders and to provide high-quality customer service depends in part on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. The computer hardware necessary to operate our consumer website is in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lifetouch maintains critical data centers in St. Paul, Minnesota and in Ontario, Canada. We also have computer hardware located in each of our production facilities and operations centers. In addition, we also use third-party public clouds for our system operation. Our systems and operations could suffer damage or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, insufficient power availability, telecommunications failure, break-ins, hacking, distributed denial of service attacks, misuse by spammers, terrorist attacks, acts of war and similar events. In addition, our headquarters are located near a major fault line increasing our susceptibility to the risk that an earthquake could significantly harm our operations. We maintain business interruption insurance; however, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur, particularly from interruption due to an earthquake which is not covered under our current policy. We do not presently have redundant systems in multiple locations. In addition, the impact of any of these disasters on our business may be exacerbated by the fact that we are still in the process of developing our formal disaster recovery plan and we do not have a final plan in place.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing and maintaining our new enterprise resource planning system.\nWe purchased a new ERP system and are currently beginning its implementation. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nTo attract new personnel, we may need to grant inducement equity awards outside of our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which dilutes the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nSince 2007, our board of directors has approved inducement equity awards outside of our 2006 Plan and 2015 Plan to select new employees upon hire and in connection with mergers and acquisitions without stockholder approval in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) for an aggregate of 3,338,561 shares of our common stock. The use of inducement equity awards may dilute the equity interest of our stockholders, which could in turn adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIn addition, we may issue equity securities to complete an acquisition, or for other reasons, which would dilute our existing stockholders' ownership, perhaps significantly depending on the terms of such acquisitions or other activities and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. To finance any future acquisitions, it may also be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private debt and equity financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, and, in the case of equity financings, would result in dilution to our stockholders. Also, the value of our stock may be insufficient to attract acquisition candidates.\nIf we were to become subject to e-mail blacklisting, traffic to our websites would be reduced and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nVarious private entities attempt to regulate the use of e-mail for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain e-mail solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as unsolicited bulk e-mails, or \u201cspam.\u201d Some of these entities maintain blacklists of companies and individuals, and the websites, Internet service providers and Internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to what the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate standards of conduct or practices for commercial e-mail solicitations. If a company\u2019s Internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, e-mails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any Internet domain or Internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity\u2019s service or purchases its blacklist. From time to time we are blacklisted, sometimes without our knowledge, which could impair our ability to sell our products and services, communicate with our customers and otherwise operate our business. In addition, we have noted that unauthorized \u201cspammers\u201d utilize our domain name to solicit spam, which increases the frequency and likelihood that we may be blacklisted.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation.\nWe rely on Internet search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing, including through the purchase of keywords related to photo-based products, to generate traffic to our websites. We obtain a significant amount of traffic via search engines and, therefore, utilize techniques such as search engine optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d) and search engine marketing (\u201cSEM\u201d) to improve our placement in relevant search queries. Search engines, including Google, Yahoo! and Bing, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user's search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects our paid or unpaid search ranking, or if competitive dynamics impact the effectiveness of SEO or SEM in a negative manner, including but not limited to increased costs for desired search queries, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent.\nWe may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brands, which would prevent us from acquiring new customers and increasing net revenue.\nA component of our business strategy is the continued promotion and strengthening of the Shutterfly, Lifetouch, Prestige Portraits, Tiny Prints, Groovebook and BorrowLenses brands. Due to the competitive nature of the digital photography products and services industry, if we are unable to successfully promote our brands, we may fail to acquire new customers, increase the engagement of existing customers with our brands or substantially increase our net revenue. Customer awareness and the perceived value of our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. To promote our brands, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. The failure of our brand promotion activities could adversely affect our ability to acquire new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop, market and sell new products and services that address additional market opportunities, our results of operations may suffer. In addition, we may need to expand beyond our current customer demographic to grow our business.\nAlthough earlier in our history we have focused our business on consumer industry for silver halide prints, we have consistently evolved and broadened our offering to include other photo-based products, such as cards and stationery, professionally-bound photo books, personalized gifts and home d\u00e9cor, calendars and other photo merchandise. We continually evaluate the demand for new products and services and the need to address trends in consumer demand and opportunities in the marketplace. For example, we have expanded in recent years into statement gifts and home d\u00e9cor, including wall art, ornaments and pillows, and video equipment rentals through the BorrowLenses brand, and we launched kids and pets categories in the second half of 2018. In the future, we may need to address additional segments and expand our customer demographic to grow our business. Our efforts to expand our existing services, create new products and services, address new segments or develop a significantly broader customer base may not be successful. Any failure to address additional opportunities could result in loss of market share, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in participation rate by customers in the Lifetouch school picture business and continued decrease in attendance of church services would have a negative impact on Lifetouch\u2019s revenue.\nAn important element of profitability in the school picture business is the participation rate (percentage of students photographed whose parents purchase the photo). The tradition of families purchasing an annual school photo of their child and/or the school yearbook could erode over time. Likewise, reduction in number of high school seniors who are photographed for the yearbook, combined with the availability of alternative digital platforms for commemorating school achievements, could make the traditional printed yearbook less compelling overall. Similarly, the continued secular decline in people attending church services could reduce the number of participants in our church business. The existence or continuation of such trends would result in the loss of customers as well as lower net revenue.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws and regulations and failure to adequately protect customer data could harm our business, damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers.\nFederal, state and international laws and regulations may govern the collection, use, sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers as well as school photos. In addition, we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of customer data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, U.S. Federal Trade Commission requirements or other federal, state or international privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could potentially harm our business. Further, failure or perceived failure to comply with our policies or applicable requirements related to the collection, use or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers.\nThe regulatory framework is constantly evolving, and privacy concerns could adversely affect our operation results.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The occurrence of unanticipated events often rapidly drives the adoption of legislation or regulation affecting the use of data and the way we conduct our business; in fact, there are active discussions among U.S. legislators around adoption of a new U.S. federal privacy law. Restrictions could be placed upon the collection, management, aggregation and use of information, which could result in a material increase in the cost of collecting certain kinds of data. For example, the European Parliament formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which established a new framework for data protection in Europe effective as of May 2018. The GDPR imposes more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information, such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), reliance on express consent from data subjects (as opposed to assumed or implied consent), a right to require data processors to delete personal data, and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms. In June of 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which will take effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has many similarities to the GDPR and imposes significant new obligations and limitations on businesses, including the Company, that collect and process personal information of California citizens. Complying with CCPA and changing domestic and international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs, require the Company to change its business practices or reduce the overall demand for our business offerings, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nLifetouch is uniquely subject to several student data privacy laws; any adverse publicity stemming from a data breach or failure to protect personal data (whether valid or perceived) could adversely affect Lifetouch\u2019s relationship with schools, districts, education associations and parent groups, leading to loss of future business.\nIn its role as a service provider to schools, Lifetouch is subject to various privacy laws and regulations including, without limitation, the Family Educational Rights in Privacy Act (FERPA), Connecticut\u2019s Act Concerning Student Privacy (Public Act No. 16-189), Colorado\u2019s Student Data Transparency and Security Act (16 CRS 22) and Canadian privacy statutes. In recent years (since 2014), numerous student privacy bills have been introduced and laws passed at the federal and state levels. These laws regulate the way Lifetouch collects and handles the school data it relies on to conduct Picture Day, and the way Lifetouch contracts with schools for such services. Lifetouch also historically has relied on schools to distribute portrait packages and access credentials to parents. Newer methods enabling parents to order and receive their child\u2019s images online provide many advantages but also entail risks inherent to internet transactions. We cannot guarantee that a person ordering a child\u2019s photo has the legal right to receive it. Actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws could lead to significant reputational damage, enforcement actions, penalties and expenses. Additionally, the evolving regulatory environment for student data privacy may make it more difficult for Lifetouch to obtain the data from schools that it requires to conduct an efficient Picture Day, which may result in higher costs and inefficiencies. Increasing compliance and contracting requirements means increasing exposure to liability for breach and rising cost of doing business.\nIf a change in privacy laws requires Lifetouch to obtain prior express parental consent to photograph children in schools, or if inclusion in a school yearbook requires express parental consent, participation rates may decline. Additionally, if systems failure or human error results in failed delivery or unauthorized access to our images, it could result in harm to our reputation and/or customer and account loss. In either of these instances, our financial results would likely suffer.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features and functionalities or to obtain and use information that we consider proprietary, such as the technology used to operate our websites, our production operations and our trademarks.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Shutterfly and Lifetouch had 143 patents issued and more than 30 patent applications pending in the United States. We intend to pursue corresponding patent coverage in other countries to the extent we believe such coverage is appropriate and cost efficient. We cannot ensure that any of our pending applications will be granted. In addition, third parties have in the past and could in the future bring infringement, invalidity, co-inventorship or similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future. Any such claims, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert management\u2019s time and attention, damage our reputation and brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur primary brands are \u201cShutterfly,\u201d \u201cLifetouch,\u201d \"Prestige Portraits,\" \u201cTiny Prints,\u201d \u201cWedding Paper Divas,\u201d and \u201cBorrowLenses.\u201d We hold applications and/or registrations for the Shutterfly, Lifetouch, Prestige Portraits, Tiny Prints, Wedding Paper Divas, BorrowLenses and Groovebook trademarks in our major territories of the United States and Canada as well as in the European Community. Our trademarks are critical components of our marketing programs. If we lose the ability to use these trademarks in any particular sector, we could be forced to either incur significant additional marketing expenses within that sector or elect not to sell products in that sector.\nFrom time to time, third parties have adopted names similar to ours, applied to register trademarks similar to ours, and we believe have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights and impeded our ability to build brand identity, possibly leading to customer confusion. In addition, we have been and may continue to be subject to potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of trademarks that are similar to Shutterfly, Lifetouch, Tiny Prints, Wedding Paper Divas, BorrowLenses, or one of our other trademarks.\nWe respond on a case-by-case basis and where appropriate may send cease and desist letters or commence opposition actions and litigation. However, we cannot ensure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer\nconfusion or negatively affect consumers' perception of our brands, products, and services. Any claims or consumer confusion related to our trademarks could damage our reputation and brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we become involved in intellectual property litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs, expenses or liability, lose our exclusive rights or be required to stop certain of our business activities.\nFrom time to time, we have received, and likely will continue to receive, communications from third parties inviting us to license their patents or accusing us of infringement. There can be no assurance that a third party will not take further action, such as filing a patent infringement lawsuit, including a request for injunctive relief to bar the manufacture and sale of our products and services in the United States or elsewhere. We may also choose to defend ourselves by initiating litigation or administrative proceedings to clarify or seek a declaration of our rights. Additionally, from time to time, we have to defend against infringement of our intellectual property by bringing suit against other parties. As competition in our industry grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us or litigation we will initiate increases.\nThe cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, whether or not initiated by us and even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts from growing our business. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nAlternatively, we may be required to, or decide to, enter into a license with a third party. Any future license required under any other party\u2019s patents may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively conduct certain of our business activities, which could limit our ability to generate revenue and harm our results of operations and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, restrictions on imports and exports, customs, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, rights of publicity and rights of privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property use and ownership, sales and other taxes, fraud, libel and personal privacy and the rights of publicity apply to the Internet and e-commerce as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. Those laws that do reference the Internet continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. For example, and without limitation:\n\u2022The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for including (or for listing or linking to third-party websites that include) materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. We rely on the protections provided by both the DMCA and CDA in conducting our business. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing their protections will subject us to greater risk of liability and may increase our costs of compliance with these regulations or limit our ability to operate certain lines of business.\n\u2022The Children\u2019s Online Protection Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.\n\u2022The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act) is intended to protect consumers from unfair credit card billing practices and adds new regulations on the use of gift cards, limiting our ability to expire them. Several states are attempting to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try to pass new laws regulating the use of gift cards and amending state escheatment laws to try and obtain unused gift card balances.\n\u2022The Restore Online Shoppers\u2019 Confidence Act (ROSCA) prohibits and prevents Internet-based post-transaction third-party sales and imposes specific requirements on negative option features.\n\u2022The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (PIPEDA) and substantially similar provincial laws in Canada govern how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.\n\u2022The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020, requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and how we advertise to our users and to incur substantial expenditure in order to comply.\n\u2022The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (IBIPA) regulates the collection, use, safeguarding, and storage of \"biometric identifiers\" or \"biometric information\" by private entities. While the statute specifically excludes photographs from its scope, to date there has been no dispositive judicial interpretation of that language.\nThe costs of compliance with these and other regulations may increase in the future because changes in the regulations or the interpretation of them. Further, any failures on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to significant liabilities. Those current and future laws and regulations or unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nLegislation regarding copyright protection or content review could impose complex and costly constraints on our business model.\nAlthough our websites' terms of use specifically require customers to represent that they have the right and authority to provide and submit to us and to reproduce the content they provide and submit and that the content is in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and does not infringe on any third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or rights of privacy, we do not have the ability to determine the accuracy of these representations on a case-by-case basis. There is a risk that a customer may supply an image or other content that is the property of another party used without permission, that infringes the copyright or trademark of another party or another party's right of privacy or right of publicity, or that would be considered to be defamatory, pornographic, hateful, racist, scandalous, obscene or otherwise offensive, objectionable or illegal under the laws or court decisions of the jurisdiction where that customer lives. There is, therefore, a risk that customers may intentionally or inadvertently order and receive products from us that are in violation of the rights of another party or a law or regulation of a particular jurisdiction. If we should become legally obligated in the future to perform manual screening and review for all orders destined for a jurisdiction, we will encounter increased production costs or may cease accepting orders for shipment to that jurisdiction which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nLifetouch often contracts with schools to provide spring portraits that feature a variety of looks and media different from the traditional fall headshot and that offer schools an opportunity for fundraising. In some markets, Lifetouch offers spring portraits under a \u201cFamily Approval\u201d model whereby portrait products are distributed by the school to parents for review. Parents are asked to pay for the products they elect to keep (if any) and to return any products they do not wish to purchase to the school. Lifetouch has been and, in the future, may be subject to claims from individuals that these products qualify as \u201cgifts\u201d and/or that the program does not comply with legislation pertaining to \u201cunsolicited goods.\u201d While we do not believe that such legislation is applicable to school photography, if Lifetouch becomes subject to such claims and is required or elect to curtail the use of the Family Approval model, its business and revenue may be negatively impacted.\nOur marketing practices could be subject to judicial or regulatory challenge.\nWe regularly offer free products, free shipping or free trials as an inducement for customers to try our products or as part of other promotional photographic programs. Although we believe that we conspicuously and clearly communicate all details and conditions of these offers, for example, that customers are required to pay shipping, handling and/or processing charges to take advantage of a free product offer or that for our spring school photo day, families must return payments along with any prints they do not want under our \u201cfamily approval model\u201d, we have been and, in the future, may be subject to claims from individuals or governmental regulators that our offers are misleading or do not comply with applicable legislation. These claims may be expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s time and attention. If we become subject to such claims in the future or are required or elect to curtail or eliminate our use of free offers, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.\nSome of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to issues such as personal injury, death, or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Any claims, litigation, or recalls relating to product liability could be costly to us and damage our brands and reputation.\nThe failure of our suppliers and manufacturing fulfillers to use legal and ethical business practices could negatively impact our business.\nWe source the raw materials for the products we sell from an expanding number of suppliers in an increasing number of jurisdictions worldwide, and we contract with third-party manufacturers to fulfill customer orders. Although we require our suppliers and fulfillers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws, including those regarding corruption, working conditions, employment practices, safety and health, and environmental compliance, we cannot control their business practices, and we may not be able to adequately vet, monitor, and audit our many suppliers and fulfillers (or their suppliers) throughout the world. If any of them violates labor, environmental, or other laws or implements business practices that are regarded as unethical, our reputation could be severely damaged, and our supply chain and order fulfillment process could be interrupted, which could harm our sales and results of operations.\nWe are subject to safety, health, and environmental laws and regulations, which could result in liabilities, cost increases or restrictions on our operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of safety, health and environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and other regulated substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. We use regulated substances such as inks and solvents and generate air emissions and other discharges at our manufacturing facilities, and some of our facilities are required to hold environmental permits. If we fail to comply with existing safety, health and environmental laws and regulations, or new, more stringent safety, health and environmental laws and regulations applicable to us are imposed, we may be subject to monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims, or the limitation or suspension of our operations. In addition, if we are found to be responsible for hazardous substances at any location (including, for example, offsite waste disposal facilities or facilities at which we formerly operated), we may be responsible for the cost of cleaning up contamination, regardless of fault, as well as to claims for harm to health or property or for natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to adapt to the continued evolution of digital photography.\nThe digital photography industry is rapidly evolving. Professional photography and the tradition of school pictures is subject to continuing disruption from the changes in digital photography and commerce. Changing technologies, intense price competition, additional competitors, evolving industry standards, frequent new service and platform announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors, including an ongoing trend toward increased video consumption, all impact our business. To the extent that consumer adoption of digital photography does not continue to grow as expected, our revenue growth would likely suffer. A shift in consumer demands toward video would also require additional network infrastructure, including data storage, to continue to satisfy the needs of our customers. Moreover, we face significant risks that, if the industry for digital photography evolves in ways that we are not able to address due to changing technologies or consumer behaviors, pricing pressures, or otherwise, we may find it difficult to create products to accommodate such an evolution or our current products and services may become less attractive, which would result in the loss of customers, as well as lower net revenue and/or increased expenses.\nPurchasers of digital photography products and services may not choose to shop or rent online, which would harm our net revenue and results of operations.\nThe online industry for digital photography products and services, including photographic and video equipment rentals, is less developed than the online industry for other consumer products. With the acquisition of Lifetouch, our delivery of photographic products is greatly increased. Our success, and a key synergy anticipated from the acquisition of Lifetouch, will depend in part on our ability to acquire customers who historically have used traditional retail photography services or who have produced photographs and other products using self-service alternatives, such as printing at home. Furthermore, we may have to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures or reduce the prices of our products and services to acquire additional online consumers to our websites and convert them into purchasing customers. Specific factors that could prevent prospective customers from purchasing from us include:\n\u2022 the inability to physically handle and examine product samples;\n\u2022 delivery time associated with Internet orders;\n\u2022 costs associated with shipping and handling;\n\u2022 concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of personal information;\n\u2022 delayed shipments or shipments of incorrect or damaged products; and\n\u2022 inconvenience associated with returning or exchanging purchased items.\nIf purchasers of digital photography products and services do not choose to shop or rent online, our net revenue and results of operations would be harmed.\nIf our internal controls are not effective or our third-party software systems that we use to assist us in the calculation and reporting of financial data have errors, there may be errors in our financial information that could require a restatement or delay our SEC filings, and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nIt is possible that we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. This risk is heightened during the period in which we are integrating Lifetouch, which has not previously been subject to the heightened control standards of a public company. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial information. We use numerous third-party licensed software packages, most notably our equity software, leasing software and our SBS resource planning software, which are complex and fully integrated into our financial reporting. Such third-party software may contain errors that we may not identify in a timely manner. If those errors are not identified and addressed timely, our financial reporting may not be in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. Any such delays, errors or restatements could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our stock price.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employee, and business partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nMaintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 contains various provisions applicable to the corporate governance functions of public companies. Additional or new regulatory requirements may be adopted in the future. The requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting. Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over relevant processes and to remediate any deficiencies. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation from federal and state audits, changes in U.S. tax laws and stock-based compensation activity.\nTax audits by taxing agencies for the open tax years could lead to fluctuations in our effective tax rate because the taxing authority may disagree with certain assumptions we have made regarding appropriate credits and deductions in filing our tax returns.\nOur effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations under current tax regulations due to of stock-based compensation activity. This activity includes items such as windfalls and shortfalls associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, disqualifying dispositions when employees exercise and sell their incentive stock options within a two-year period, and exercise or cancellation of vested non-qualified stock options.\nAdditionally, in December 2017, the current U.S. administration signed an act referred to as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the \"TCJA\"), generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA is complex and includes significant amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), including amendments that significantly change the taxation of offshore earnings and the deductibility of interest. Compliance with the TCJA and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the TCJA in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe may undertake acquisitions to expand our business, which may pose risks to our business and dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nA key component of our business strategy includes strengthening our competitive position and refining the customer experience on our websites and mobile applications through internal development. However, from time to time, we may selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be time-consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies we expect due to a number of factors including the loss of management focus on and the diversion of resources from existing businesses; difficulty retaining key personnel of the acquired company; cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company into our organization; difficulty integrating acquired technologies into our existing systems; entry into a business or industry with which we have historically had little experience; difficulty and increased costs of integrating data systems; the need to implement or remediate the controls, procedures or policies of the acquired company; and increased risk of litigation. While we have actively sought to control increases in costs that may stem from such acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill in connection with such acquisitions could harm our operating results.\nInternational expansion would require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful, which could harm our future business development and existing domestic operations.\nTo date, we have conducted limited international operations, but may in the future decide to expand into international industries to grow our business. These expansion plans will require significant management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. We have limited experience adapting our products to conform to local cultures, standards and policies. We may have to compete with established local or regional companies which understand the local industry better than we do. In addition, to achieve satisfactory performance for consumers in international locations it may be necessary to locate physical facilities, such as production facilities, in the foreign industries. We do not have experience establishing, acquiring or operating such facilities overseas. We may not be successful in expanding into any international industries or in generating revenue from foreign operations. In addition, different privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations and different intellectual property laws in foreign countries may result in additional expenses, diversion of resources, including the attention of our management team.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning real property.\nWe own real property as of the acquisition of Lifetouch, including the land and buildings at ten of the Lifetouch facilities. The ownership of real property subjects us to risks, including: the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems and the risk of damages resulting from such contamination; adverse changes in the value of the property due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located or other factors; ongoing maintenance expenses and costs of improvements; the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic, disability act or other requirements; and possible disputes with neighboring owners or others.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, the stock market as a whole recently has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to those companies\u2019 operating performance. In addition, our stock price increased significantly after we announced our intention to acquire Lifetouch. Factors that could cause our stock price to fluctuate include:\n\u2022failure to realize the anticipated benefits from the Lifetouch acquisition;\n\u2022slow economic growth, and market conditions or trends in our industry or the macro-economy as a whole;\n\u2022worldwide economic and market trends and conditions;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u2022the potential impact of the current U.S. political climate on consumer spending;\n\u2022the loss of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our stock;\n\u2022ratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our company or debt rating agencies;\n\u2022business disruptions and costs related to shareholder activism;\n\u2022the public\u2019s response to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u2022introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nProvisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law may deter third parties from acquiring us.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including the following:\n\u2022our board is classified into three classes of directors, each with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022only our chairman, our president and chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \"business combinations\" between a Delaware corporation and an \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be re-suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn April of 2017, our board of directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program of up to $140.0 million in addition to amounts remaining under the board's prior authorizations. Through December 31, 2018, we have repurchased $533.2 million in stock under our total authorized amount of $646.0 million. In January 2018, we publicly announced that we had suspended our stock repurchase program, which we expect to reinstate in the fourth quarter of 2019. The stock repurchase program may be recontinued or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In the event that we recontinue our stock repurchase program, future repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of our stock repurchase program could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to further develop our technology, access and/or retrofit additional facilities and service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit facilities if we want to pay cash dividends. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.\nRisks Related to Our Credit Agreement\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOn April 2, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of Lifetouch, we incurred substantial indebtedness pursuant to an incremental term loan facility (the \u201cIncremental Term Loan Facility\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $825.0 million. The incremental term loan facility is an amendment of our initial term loan facility of $300.0 million dated as of August 17, 2017 (collectively, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Incremental Term Loan Facility was fully funded at close. The Credit Agreement will mature on August 17, 2024 and requires quarterly principal payments, as well as mandatory prepayments due to assets sales or excess cash flow, with the balance payable at maturity.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and our industry;\n\u2022our ability to refinance our debt;\n\u2022exposing us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness; and\n\u2022making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the lenders would have the ability to immediately declare the loans due and payable in whole or in part. In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, leverage ratios, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of current or future debt and may adversely affect our share price.\nOur Credit Agreement imposes restrictions on our business.\nThe Credit Agreement contains several covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions, among other things, restrict our ability to create or incur certain liens, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other companies, payment of dividends, transfer or sell assets and make restricted payments. These restrictions are subject to several limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Our ability to meet the liquidity covenant may be affected by events beyond our control.\nThe foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in market conditions or our capital needs. We do not know whether we will be granted waivers under, or amendments to, our Credit Agreement if for any reason we are unable to meet these requirements, or whether we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, and to refinance our debt, depends on our future performance, which is subject to financial, competitive, economic, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to make necessary capital expenditures or to satisfy our obligations under the Credit Agreement and any future indebtedness that we may incur. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed, which could result in a default on our indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 91486, "SIC": 2731, "TIC": "SFLY"}
