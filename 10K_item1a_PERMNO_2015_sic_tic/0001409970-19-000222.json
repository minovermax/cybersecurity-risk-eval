{"cik": "1409970", "company": "LendingClub Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Report), including the section titled \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. While we believe the risks and uncertainties described below include all material risks currently known by us, it is possible that these may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND REGULATION\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with issuing banks, our business will suffer.\nWe rely on issuing banks to originate all loans and to comply with various federal, state and other laws, as discussed more fully above in \u201cItem 1. Business - Relationships with Issuing Bank Partners.\u201d\nOur agreements with WebBank are non-exclusive and do not prohibit WebBank from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. WebBank currently offers loan programs through other online lending marketplaces and other alternative lenders. WebBank could decide that working with us is not in its interest or could decide to enter into exclusive or more favorable relationships with our competitors. In addition, WebBank may not perform as expected under our agreements including potentially being unable to accommodate our projected growth in loan volume. We could in the future have disagreements or disputes with WebBank or other issuing banks, which could negatively impact or threaten our relationship.\nWebBank is subject to oversight by the FDIC and the State of Utah and must comply with complex rules and regulations, licensing and examination requirements, including requirements to maintain a certain amount of regulatory capital relative to its outstanding loans. We are a service provider to WebBank, and as such, we are subject to audit by WebBank in accordance with FDIC guidance related to management of third-party vendors. We are also subject to the examination and enforcement authority of the FDIC as a bank service company covered by the Bank Service Company Act. We have indemnification obligations and exposure under our agreements with WebBank, including with respect to our compliance with certain applicable laws. If WebBank were to suspend, limit or cease its operations or our relationship with WebBank were to otherwise terminate, we would need to implement a substantially similar arrangement with another issuing bank, obtain additional state licenses or curtail our operations. Our agreement with WebBank has an initial term ending on January 31, 2020 and renews automatically for two successive terms of one year each, unless either party provides notice of non-renewal to the other party in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. As of the date of this Report, no backup issuing banks have originated any loans facilitated through our marketplace and we do not have a backup origination arrangement.\nWe believe that our relationship with WebBank is critical to our business. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationships with WebBank, our ability to provide loan products could be materially impaired and our operating results would suffer. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements with a different issuing bank to replace our existing arrangements, we may not be able to negotiate a comparable alternative arrangement. Transitioning loan originations to a new issuing bank is untested and may result in delays in the issuance of loans or, if our platform becomes inoperable, may result in our inability to facilitate loans through our platform. If we were unable to enter in an alternative arrangement with a different issuing bank, we would need to obtain or activate a state license in each state in which we operate to enable us to originate loans, as well as comply with other state and federal laws, which would be costly, time-consuming and may necessitate that we materially alter our business and operations. If we were to become a loan originator through state licenses or federal charter, we may become subject to expanded compliance requirements and be constrained in our product offerings, capital requirements, or other limitations that may be less favorable than our current arrangements.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nSubstantial and increasing competition in our industry may harm our business.\nThe lending industry is increasingly competitive. We compete with financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or both, as described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition.\u201d\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and may have less expensive access to capital than we do, and may offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have different profitability expectations than us. Certain competitors may be able to offer lower rates to borrowers than we are able to offer and/or structure their loan products in a manner that is more attractive to potential borrowers and investors. Additionally, some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing and other regulatory requirements.\nIf we do not offer, price and develop attractive products and services for our borrowers and investors, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors and our business and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nWe are regularly subject to litigation, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries and requests, including matters related to our legacy management and the resignation of our former Chief Executive Officer.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, lawsuits alleging regulatory violations such as Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) or Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP) violations, government and regulatory exams, investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings involving consumer protection, privacy, labor and employment, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security, securities, tax, commercial disputes, record retention and other matters. The number and significance of these claims, lawsuits, exams, investigations, inquiries and requests have increased as our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. We have also been subject to significant litigation and regulatory inquiries following our 2016 Board Review and the resignation of our former CEO, as discussed more fully in \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d below. While we have resolved private litigation against the Company arising from these matters and we have also resolved investigations of the SEC and DOJ, we continue to be subject to regulatory investigations and litigation with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In particular, note that on April 25, 2018, the FTC filed a complaint in the Northern District of California (FTC v. LendingClub Corporation, No. 3:18-cv-02454) alleging causes of action for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended, including claims of deception in connection with disclosures related to the origination fee associated with loans available through the Company\u2019s platform, and in connection with communications relating to the likelihood of loan approval during the application process, and a claim of unfairness relating to certain unauthorized charges to borrowers\u2019 bank accounts. The FTC\u2019s complaint also alleged a violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act regarding the Company\u2019s practices in delivering its privacy notice.\nThe scope, timing, outcome, consequences and impact of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries and requests that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. Furthermore, resolution of such claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries and requests could result in substantial fines and penalties, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These claims, lawsuits, proceedings, exams, investigations, inquiries and requests could also: (i) result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, (ii) limit the Company\u2019s access to credit, (iii) result in a modification or suspension of our business practices (including limiting the maximum interest rate on certain loans facilitated through our platform and/or refraining from making certain loans available for investment by certain investors), (iv) require us to develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, (v) prompt ancillary claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries and requests, (vi) consume financial and other resources which may otherwise be utilized for other purposes such as advancing the Company\u2019s products, services and/or results of operations, (vii) cause a breach or cancellation of certain contracts, or\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\n(viii) result in a loss of borrowers, investors and/or ecosystem partners, any of which may adversely affect our business and operations. Furthermore, even following the resolution of any claims, lawsuits, proceedings, exams, investigations, inquiries and requests against the Company, a regulatory enforcement agency could take action against one or more individuals or entities, which may require us to continue to incur significant expense for indemnification for any such individual or entity until such matters may be resolved. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business.\nHolding loans on our balance sheet exposes us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our financial performance.\nA portion of the loans facilitated through our platform are purchased by the Company for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) to support structured program transactions, (ii) to facilitate certain whole loan sales initiatives, (iii) to enable the testing or initial launch of alternative loan terms, programs or channels, and (iv) to mitigate marketplace imbalances on our platform for limited grades or terms, which arise when there is insufficient investor demand for certain loans available for purchase.\nWe may hold loans purchased by the Company for a short period or for a longer term. While these loans are on our balance sheet we earn interest on the loans, but we have exposure to the credit risk of the borrowers. In the event of a decline or volatility in the credit profile of these borrowers the value of these held loans may decline. This may adversely impact the liquidity of these loans, which could produce losses if the Company is unable to realize their fair value or manage declines in their value, each of which may adversely affect our financial performance.\nWith respect to a portion of loans facilitated through our platform and purchased by the Company, including a portion of those that are purchased to mitigate marketplace imbalances for certain grades or terms from time to time, we may provide incentives to investors to purchase such loans from the Company or we may sell the loans at a price that is less than par. Any incentive or difference to par may be partially or wholly offset by other factors, such as interest earned on the loan prior to its sale. However, selling loans with incentives or at prices less than par may discourage investors from purchasing loans on our platform without incentives or at par value, cause the Company to realize less revenue than expected with respect to such loans or prompt dissatisfaction and complaints from investors unable to purchase incentivized or discounted loans, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf the loans facilitated through our lending marketplace were found to violate a state\u2019s usury laws, and/or we were found to be the true lender (as opposed to our issuing bank(s)), we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed.\nThe interest rates that are charged to borrowers and that form the basis of payments to investors through our lending marketplace are enabled by legal principles including (i) the application of federal law to enable an issuing bank that originates the loan to \u201cexport\u201d the interest rates of the jurisdiction where it is located, (ii) the application of common law \u201cchoice of law\u201d principles based upon factors such as the loan document\u2019s terms and where the loan transaction is completed to provide uniform rates to borrowers, or (iii) the application of principles that allow the transferee of a loan to continue to collect interest as provided in the loan document. WebBank, the primary issuing bank of the loans facilitated through our lending marketplace, is chartered in, and operates out of, Utah, which allows parties to generally agree by contract to any interest rate. Certain states, including Utah, have no statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans, while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate. In some jurisdictions, the maximum rate is less than the current maximum rate offered by WebBank through our platform. If the laws of such jurisdictions were found to govern the loans facilitated through our lending marketplace (in conflict with the principles described above), those loans could be in violation of such laws.\nWe operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment at the federal and state level and although we strive to work with federal, state and local regulatory agencies to help them understand our model and its benefits for consumers, our issuing bank partnership model may be deemed to be inappropriate for certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Specifically, note that as discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nFramework\u201d above, in May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act (NBA) and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. The Second Circuit\u2019s decision is binding on federal courts located in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, but the decision could also be adopted by other courts. While we believe that our program is factually distinguishable from such case, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC could create potential liability under state statutes such as usury and consumer protection statutes.\nIn addition, there have been (and may continue to be) regulatory inquiries and/or litigation challenging lending arrangements where a bank or other third-party has made a loan and then sells and assigns it to an entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination and servicing of a loan. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance Framework\u201d above for more information.\nFor example, in January 2017, the Colorado Administrator of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (Administrator) filed suit against Avant, Inc., a company that operates an online consumer loan platform. The Administrator asserts that loans to Colorado residents facilitated through Avant\u2019s platform were required to comply with Colorado laws regarding interest rates and fees, and that those laws are not preempted by federal laws that apply to loans originated by WebBank, the federally regulated issuing bank who originates loans through Avant\u2019s platform, as well as through our platform. Although Avant removed its case to federal court in March 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado issued an order in March 2018 remanding the case to the District Court for the City and County of Denver. In March 2018, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado also issued an order dismissing a parallel case brought by WebBank that sought a declaratory judgment regarding the applicability of federal preemption to Colorado usury laws and permanent injunctions against the Administrator that would prevent the Administrator from enforcing Colorado usury laws against WebBank and certain parties associated with loans originated by it. Avant thereafter filed a Motion to Dismiss in District Court for the State of Colorado and WebBank moved to intervene in the case. On August 14, 2018, the Court granted WebBank\u2019s motion but denied Avant\u2019s motion. In November 2018, the Administrator added as defendants certain securitization trusts that had acquired Avant loans. The Administrator is seeking a penalty of ten times the amount of the \u201cexcess\u201d finance charges. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of these matters. However, these matters could potentially impact the Company\u2019s business, including the maximum interest rates and fees that can be charged, application of certain consumer protection statutes and access to the securitization markets.\nThe Company is currently in discussions with the Colorado Department of Law (the CDL) concerning the licenses required for the Company\u2019s servicing operations and the structure of its offerings in the State of Colorado. While we believe that our program with WebBank has been structured in accordance with governing federal law, the CDL has identified alleged \u201cexceptions\u201d to our compliance with provisions of the Colorado Uniform Consumer Credit Code, including with respect to specifying permitted rates and charges. We believe that our model differs in important respects from Avant\u2019s business model as alleged in the litigation involving Avant in Colorado. Nevertheless, while awaiting resolution of these matters and as of the date of this Report, we are also in discussion with the CDL about entering into a terminable agreement to, among other things: (i) toll the statutes of limitations on any action the CDL might bring against us based on the rates and charges on the loans we facilitate and (ii) refrain from making certain loans available for investment by certain investors.\nIf a borrower or a state were to successfully bring claims against us for state usury law violations, and the rate on that borrower\u2019s personal loan was greater than that allowed under applicable state law, we could be subject to fines and penalties, including the voiding of loans and repayment of principal and interest to borrowers and investors, and may be in breach of certain representation and warranties we make to our platform investors. Additionally, we might decide to modify or suspend certain of our business practices, including limiting the maximum interest rate on certain loans facilitated through our platform and/or refraining from making certain loans available for investment by certain investors, and we might decide to originate loans under state-specific licenses, where such a ruling is applicable. These actions could adversely impact our business. Further, if we were unable to partner with another issuing bank, we would have to substantially modify our business operations from the manner currently\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\ncontemplated and would be required to maintain state-specific licenses and only provide a limited range of interest rates for personal loans, all of which would substantially reduce our operating efficiency and attractiveness to investors and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for our business is evolving and uncertain as federal and state governments consider new laws to regulate online lending marketplaces such as ours. New laws and regulations, including uncertainty as to how the actions of any federal or state regulator could impact our business or that of our issuing bank(s).\nThe regulatory framework for online lending marketplaces such as ours is evolving and uncertain. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the operation of our lending marketplace and the way in which we interact with borrowers and investors. Furthermore, the costs associated with staying current and complying with the regulatory framework may divert significant resources which otherwise might be utilized for other purposes such as advancing the Company\u2019s products, services and/or results of operations. For a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance Framework.\u201d\nFederal Regulatory Framework\nOCC Guidance\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance Framework\u201d above, the OCC has considered the adoption of a Fintech Charter. We cannot predict whether or when the OCC will begin accepting applications for Fintech Charters, if we will pursue a Fintech Charter or other banking charter, or how this new Fintech Charter could impact our industry, business and results of operations going forward.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance Framework\u201d above, the CFPB previously announced that it intends to expand its supervisory authority through the use of \u201clarger participant rules.\u201d The CFPB has not announced specifics regarding its proposed rulemaking, and recently announced that it intends to review its policies and priorities. Consequently, there continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB\u2019s strategies and priorities, including any final rules, will impact our businesses and results of operations going forward.\nState Regulatory Framework\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance Framework\u201d above, at the state level, certain states are considering the scope of their regulation and oversight of the financial technology industry. The application of state laws to our business, including the application of usury laws, now or as they may be written or interpreted in the future, could have a significant impact on our ability to do business in any given state and may impact our business and results of operations going forward.\nFederal and State Borrower and Consumer Protection Laws\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Consumer Protection Laws and Other Regulations\u201d above, we and our issuing bank partners must comply with regulatory regimes, including those applicable to consumer credit transactions, various aspects of which are untested as applied to our lending marketplace. Certain state laws generally regulate interest rates and other charges and require certain disclosures. In addition, other federal and state laws may apply to the origination and servicing of loans facilitated through our lending marketplace.\nWhile we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nIn particular, the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts and monitoring their transactions. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. Recently several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our business may, among other things, limit our or a collection agency\u2019s ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on loans. As a result, we may not be able to collect our servicing fee with respect to the uncollected principal or interest, and investors may be discouraged from investing in loans. In addition, non-compliance could subject us to damages, revocation of required licenses, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions, rescission rights held by investors in securities offerings and civil and criminal liability, which may harm our business and our ability to maintain our lending marketplace and may result in borrowers rescinding their loans.\nState Licensing Requirements\nWhere applicable, we will seek to comply with state small loan, lender, solicitation, credit service organization, loan broker, servicing and similar statutes. In U.S. jurisdictions with licensing or other requirements that we believe may be applicable to us, we believe we comply with or are exempt from the relevant requirements through the operation of our lending marketplace with issuing banks and/or licenses that we possess or will seek to obtain. Although we periodically evaluate the need for licensing in various jurisdictions, there is a risk that, at any given time, we will not have the necessary licenses to operate in all relevant jurisdictions or that we will be in full compliance with all applicable requirements. If we are found to not have complied with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, we could: (i) lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations, (ii) become subject to a consent order or administrative enforcement action, (iii) face lawsuits (including class action lawsuits), sanctions or penalties, (iv) be in breach of certain contracts, which may void or cancel such contracts, (v) decide or be compelled to modify or suspend certain of our business practices (including limiting the maximum interest rate on certain loans facilitated through our platform and/or refraining from making certain loans available for investment by certain investors), or (vi) be required to obtain a license in such jurisdiction, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to facilitate loans through our lending marketplace, perform our servicing obligations or make our lending marketplace available to borrowers in particular states; any of which may harm our business.\nFluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect transaction volume.\nAs of the date of this Report, all personal, auto, and small business loans facilitated through our lending marketplace are issued with fixed interest rates, and education and patient finance loans are issued with fixed or variable rates, depending on the type of loan. If interest rates continue to rise potential borrowers could seek to defer taking new loans as they wait for interest rates to decrease and/or settle, and borrowers of variable rate loans may be subject to increased interest rates, which could increase default risk. If interest rates decrease after a loan is made, existing borrowers may prepay their loans to take advantage of the lower rates. Furthermore, investors would lose the opportunity to collect the higher interest rate payable on the corresponding loan and may delay or reduce future loan investments. To the extent that we hold loans for sale on our balance sheet, we will be at risk to rising interest rates between origination and sale. In order to sell such loans, we may need to reduce the sale price in order to satisfy the yield expectations of our investors.\nSince the most recent recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time. In March, June, September and December 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, respectively. Market interest rates may continue to increase and the increase may materially and negatively affect us, as rising interest\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nrates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect demand for our products and services.\nFor many reasons, including those stated above, fluctuations in the interest rate environment may discourage investors and borrowers from participating in our lending marketplace and may reduce our loan originations, which may adversely affect our business.\nIf the credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting and scoring models we use contain errors, do not adequately assess risk, or are otherwise ineffective, our reputation and relationships with borrowers and investors could be harmed, our market share could decline and the value of loans held on our balance sheet may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract borrowers and investors to, and build trust in, our lending marketplace is significantly dependent on our ability to effectively evaluate a borrower\u2019s credit profile and likelihood of default. To conduct this evaluation, we utilize credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting and scoring models that assign each loan offered on our lending marketplace a grade and a corresponding interest rate. Our models are based on algorithms that evaluate a number of factors, including behavioral data, transactional data, bank data and employment information, which may not effectively predict future loan losses. If we are unable to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles, we may be unable to offer attractive interest rates for borrowers and risk-adjusted returns for investors. Additionally, if these models fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, we may experience higher than forecasted losses. Furthermore, as stated above, we hold loans on our balance sheet for a variety of reasons. We periodically assess the value of these loans and in doing so we review and incorporate a number of factors including forecasted losses. Accordingly, if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers such that we experience higher than forecasted losses, the value of the loans held our balance sheet may be adversely affected.\nWe continually refine these algorithms based on new data and changing macro-economic conditions. However, there is no guarantee that the credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting and scoring models that we use have accurately assessed the creditworthiness of our borrowers, or will be effective in assessing creditworthiness in the future.\nSimilarly, if any of these models contain programming or other errors, are ineffective or the data provided by borrowers or third parties is incorrect or stale, our loan pricing and approval process could be negatively affected, resulting in mispriced or misclassified loans or incorrect approvals or denials of loans. If these errors were to occur, we may be obligated to repurchase the affected loans, investors may try to rescind their affected investments or decide not to invest in loans in the future or borrowers may seek to revise the terms of their loans or reduce the use of our lending marketplace for loans.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast demand for loans, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate a lending marketplace for consumer credit, balancing borrower demand for loans against investor demand for risk-adjusted returns. We offer credit to borrowers across a range of credit profiles and rates and we offer investment opportunities across a range of risk-adjusted returns. In the event that borrower demand at a given credit rate exceeds investor demand for that product for a given period, we may fund the loans and hold them on our balance sheet, which carries certain risks. In addition to the discussion in this section, see \u201cHolding loans on our balance sheet exposes us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our financial performance.\u201d\nAlternatively, in the event that investor demand at a given return exceeds borrower demand for that product for a given period, there may be insufficient inventory to satisfy investor demand. If investors do not believe their demand can be met on our platform, they may seek alternative investments from ours and our business may suffer.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to manage and grow our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs stated above, a portion of the loans facilitated through our platform are purchased by us for a variety of reasons. Purchasing loans requires liquidity and therefore managing our liquidity has become essential to our business.\nIf we have insufficient liquidity to support loan purchases, we may undertake measures to improve liquidity, including altering operations to require less liquidity, accelerating the sale of existing loans held on our balance sheet, incurring additional indebtedness or raising additional capital. Incurring additional indebtedness and raising additional capital depend on our ability to secure funding in amounts adequate to finance our current and projected operations and on terms attractive to us, each of which could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial markets generally. A lack of sufficient liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition by, among other things, impairing our ability to meet investor demand for structured program transactions or forcing us to alter our operations in a manner that may reduce origination volume.\nIn addition, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support existing operations and/or future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs which may adversely affect our operating margins and profitability.\nIf we do not maintain or continue to increase loan originations facilitated through our lending marketplace, or expand our lending marketplace to new markets, we may not succeed in maintaining and/or growing our business, and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo maintain and continue to grow our business, we must continue to increase loan originations through our lending marketplace by attracting a large number of new borrowers who meet our platform\u2019s lending standards and new and existing investors to invest in these loans. Our ability to attract qualified borrowers and attract new and retain existing investors each depends in large part on the success of our marketing efforts, our visibility, placement and customer reviews on third-party platforms, and the competitive advantage of our products, particularly as we continue to grow our lending marketplace and introduce new loan products. If any of our marketing channels become less effective, or the cost of these channels were to significantly increase, we may not be able to attract new borrowers and attract new and retain existing investors in a cost-effective manner or convert potential borrowers and investors into active borrowers and investors in our lending marketplace. Additionally, changes in the way third-party platforms operate, including changes in our participation on such platforms, could make the maintenance and promotion of our products and services, and thereby maintaining and growing loan originations, more expensive or more difficult.\nIf there are not sufficient qualified loans facilitated on the platform, investors may be unable to deploy their capital in a timely or efficient manner and may seek other investment opportunities. If the performance of loans facilitated through our platform is lower than expected, we may be unable to attract new and retain existing investors. If there is insufficient investor participation, borrowers may be unable to obtain investment capital for their loans and may stop using our lending marketplace for their borrowing needs, which will impact our business results. If loan originations through our platform decrease, for any reason, our business and financial results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we restructure our loan products, including lowering or eliminating our transaction fees, our financial results may be adversely affected even if we are able to maintain or increase loan originations through our platform.\nA small number of investors, including LendingClub, account for a large dollar amount of investment through our lending marketplace and if these investors pause or cease their participation or exert influence over us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nA small number of loan investors, including the Company, account for a large dollar amount of capital on our platform. See \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nOperations - Investments in Quarterly Originations by Investment Channel and Investor Concentration\u201d for further discussion of and information regarding our investor concentration.\nOur success depends in significant part on the financial strength of investors participating on our lending marketplace. Investors could, for any reason, experience financial difficulties and cease participating on our lending marketplace or fail to pay fees when due. The occurrence of one or more of these events with a significant number of investors could, alone or in combination, have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAdditionally, investors may exert significant influence over us, our management and operations. For example, if investors other than the Company pause or discontinue their investment activity, we may need to provide incentives or discounts and/or enter into unique structures or terms to attract investor capital to the platform. These arrangements may have a number of different structures and terms, including alternative fee arrangements or other inducements. There is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into any of these transactions if necessary, or if we do, what the final terms will be. Failure to attract investor capital on reasonable terms may result in us having to use additional capital to invest in loans or reduce origination volume. Such actions may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in social and economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nAs a lending marketplace, we believe our customers are highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends in the markets driven by, among other factors, general social and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. Economic factors include interest rates, unemployment levels, the impact of a federal government shutdown, natural disasters, gasoline prices, adjustments in monthly payments, adjustable-rate mortgages and other debt payments, the rate of inflation, relative returns available from competing investment products and consumer perceptions of economic conditions. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels and changes in attitudes with respect to incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy.\nThese social and economic factors may affect the ability or willingness of borrowers to make payments on their loans. Because we make payments to investors ratably only to the extent we receive the borrower\u2019s payments on the corresponding loan, if we do not receive payment(s) on the corresponding loan, the investor will not be entitled to the corresponding payment(s) under the terms of the investment or whole loan purchase agreement. In some circumstances, economic and/or social factors could lead to a borrower deciding to pre-pay his or her loan obligation. In the event of a prepayment, while the investor would receive the return of principal, interest would no longer accrue on the loan. Accordingly, the return for the investor would decline as compared to a loan that was timely paid in accordance with the amortization schedule. There is no penalty to borrowers if they choose to pay their loan early.\nWe strive to establish a lending marketplace in which annual percentage rates are attractive to borrowers and returns, including the impact of credit losses and prepayments, are attractive to investors. These external economic and social conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could also adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability or desire to participate on our platform as borrowers or investors, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition to the discussion in this section, see \u201cPart II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Current Economic and Business Environment.\u201d\nIf collection efforts on delinquent loans are ineffective or unsuccessful, the return on investment for investors in those loans would be adversely affected and investors may not find investing through our lending marketplace desirable.\nWith the exception of our auto loan products and certain small business loan products, loans facilitated on our platform are unsecured obligations of borrowers, and they are not secured by any collateral. None of the loans facilitated on our platform are guaranteed or insured by any third party nor backed by any governmental authority in\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nany way. We are the loan servicer for all loans supporting notes, all certificates and certain secured borrowings, and we are the loan servicer for most, though not all, loans sold as whole loans. The ability to collect on the loans is dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and consequently, collections can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including job loss, divorce, death, illness, personal bankruptcy or the economic and/or social factors referenced above. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. Accordingly, we and our designated third-party servicers and collection agencies are limited in our ability to collect loans.\nIn addition, most investors must depend on LendingClub or our third-party servicers and collection agents to pursue collection on delinquent borrower loans. We generally use our in-house collections department as a first step when a borrower misses a payment. Because we make payments ratably on an investor\u2019s investment only if we receive the borrower\u2019s payments on the corresponding loan, if we, or third parties on our behalf, cannot adequately perform collection services, the investor will not be entitled to any payments under the terms of the investment. In the event that our initial in-house attempts to contact a borrower are unsuccessful, we generally refer the delinquent account to the outside collection agent. Further, if collection action must be taken in respect of a loan, we or the collection agency may charge a collection fee on any amounts that are obtained (excluding litigation). These fees will correspondingly reduce the amounts of any payments received by an investor. Similarly, the returns to investors may be impacted by declines in market rates for sales of charged-off loans to third party purchasers. Ultimately, if delinquencies impair our ability to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors, they may seek alternative investments from ours and our business may suffer.\nIn addition, because our servicing fees depend on the collectability of the loans, if we experience a significant increase in the number of delinquent or charged-off loans we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans and our revenue could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop and commercialize new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services, our business may suffer.\nThe lending industry is evolving rapidly and changing with disruptive technologies and the introduction of new products and services. A key part of our success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services.\nFor example, the Company introduced CLUB Certificates, an instrument that trades in the over-the-counter market with a CUSIP, with the objective of creating more liquidity and demand for our unsecured personal loans. We incur expenses and expend resources to develop and commercialize new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services. However, we may not assign the appropriate level of resources, priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products, services or enhancements. We also could utilize and invest in technologies, products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and, therefore, are not as attractive or useful to our customers as we anticipate. Moreover, we may not realize the benefit of new technologies, products, services or enhancements for many years, and competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements in the meantime. Competitors also may develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that make our lending marketplace platform less attractive to our borrowers and/or investors.\nIf we are unable to develop and commercialize timely and attractive products and services for our borrowers and investors, our business may suffer.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness and any failure to meet our debt obligations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have and may continue to enter into arrangements pursuant to which we can incur significant indebtedness. For example, as of December 31, 2018, we had $95.0 million in debt outstanding under our Revolving Facility and $306.8 million in debt outstanding, in the aggregate, under our Warehouse Facilities. We may enter into additional financing arrangements, which could increase the aggregate amount of indebtedness we can incur.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund our business and operations and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to pay with available cash or generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as utilizing available capital, limiting the facilitation of additional loans, selling assets, selling equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or negatively affect our business. We also may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or take such other actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nFurthermore, as stated earlier, we have and may increasingly securitize assets and offer other similar structured instruments, such as our CLUB Certificate product. To support these offerings and other initiatives, we have and will likely continue to use credit facilities to finance the purchasing and holding of loans on our balance sheet, to ultimately be used in connection with such offerings and initiatives. If, however, we are unable to consummate these types of offerings or other initiatives in accordance with our expectations, we may be required to hold loans on our balance sheet for longer than expected, or until the maturity of the loans. This may adversely impact our ability to repay our indebtedness when due and divert resources away from other projects and initiatives.\nSome of our debt carries a floating rate of interest linked to various indices, including LIBOR. If a change in indices, including the announced discontinuation of LIBOR, results in interest rate increases on our debt, debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results.\nCredit and other information that we receive from borrowers or third parties about a borrower may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, which may cause us to inaccurately price loans facilitated through our lending marketplace.\nOur ability to review and select qualified borrowers depends on obtaining borrower credit information from consumer reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, Experian or Equifax, and other third parties and we assign loan grades to loan requests based on our lending marketplace\u2019s credit decisioning and scoring models that take into account reported credit score, other information reported by the consumer reporting agencies and the requested loan amount, in addition to a variety of other factors. A credit score or loan grade assigned to a borrower may not reflect that borrower\u2019s actual creditworthiness because the credit score may be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate consumer reporting data, and we do not verify the information obtained from the borrower\u2019s credit report.\nAdditionally, there is a risk that, following the date of the credit report or other third-party data that we obtain and review, a borrower may have:\n\u2022\nbecome delinquent in the payment of an outstanding obligation;\n\u2022\ndefaulted on a pre-existing debt obligation;\n\u2022\ntaken on additional debt; or\n\u2022\nsustained other adverse financial events.\nIn addition, borrowers supply a variety of information that is included in the loan listings on our lending marketplace, and it may be inaccurate or incomplete. To verify a borrower\u2019s identity, income or employment, our verification process and teams connect to various data sources, directly or through third-party service providers, contact the human resources department of the borrower\u2019s stated employer, or request pay stubs. However, we often do not verify a borrower\u2019s stated tenure, job title, home ownership status or intention for the use of loan proceeds.\nThe factors above may result in loans being issued to otherwise non-qualified borrowers and/or impact our ability to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles, each of which may impair our ability to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors, which may cause investors to seek alternative investments from ours and our business may suffer. Additionally, if borrowers default on loans that are not priced correctly because the information\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nprovided by the borrowers or third parties is inaccurate, investors may try to rescind their affected investments in these loans or the loans may not perform as expected and our reputation may be harmed.\nOur ability to offer our notes depends upon our compliance with requirements under federal or state securities laws.\nWe issue member payment dependent notes sold pursuant to the Note Registration Statement. We qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which allows us to file automatically effective registration statements with the SEC. Under SEC rules, for certain material updates, we must file post-effective amendments, which, if we do not qualify as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d do not become effective until declared effective by the SEC. We may fail to maintain our \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d status if we do not file SEC reports on a timely manner or for other reasons. In addition, if we fail to file our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or quarterly reports on Form 10-Q on a timely basis or are otherwise required to suspend use of a registration statement for the notes, we could be required to suspend offering of our notes until the deficiency is resolved. Because we offer notes on a continuous basis, securities law restrictions may also limit our ability to market or advertise to potential investors.\nWe are also currently required to register or qualify for an exemption in every state in which we offer securities. Qualification in a state can be a time-consuming process, often requiring periodic renewals. Failure to timely renew these registrations may require us to pay penalties, suspend further offerings until we regain compliance and make rescission offers in connection with previously completed investments.\nCertain states in which we offer notes also impose special suitability standards and other conditions for operation in their states, restricting the persons and conditions under which we may make offerings in these states. We do not offer our notes in all states due to the restrictions of certain states. While we believe that we may now rely on federal preemption of state registration and qualification requirements, states may interpret federal law as applied to our notes differently, possibly requiring us to continue to make filings in or limit operations in those states. Regardless of any such registration, qualification or preemption, we are subject to both state and federal antifraud rules of each state in which we operate.\nAs a result of these requirements, actual or alleged non-compliance with federal or state laws or changes in federal or state law or regulatory policy could limit our ability to offer notes in certain states, require us to pay fines or penalties, or curtail our operations.\nAny failure to protect our own intellectual property rights could impair our brand, or subject us to claims for alleged infringement by third parties, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, underwriting and credit decisioning credit data, processes and other intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our copyright, trade secret, trademark and other rights or applications for any of the foregoing. Further, as our business continues to expand we may increase our dependence on third parties to provide additional products and services. Third parties who are contractually obligated to protect our intellectual property may be the target of data breaches or may breach their obligations and disseminate, misappropriate or otherwise misuse our proprietary technology, underwriting and credit decisioning credit data, processes and other intellectual property. Additionally, our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. We may, however, be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. In addition, any\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nclaims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our loan products or operating our platform or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nAny significant disruption in service on our platform or in our technology systems, including events beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe believe the technology platform that powers our lending marketplace enables us to deliver solutions to borrowers and investors and provides a significant time and cost advantage over traditional banks. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service and reputation. Our failure to maintain satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure may impair our ability to attract new and retain existing borrowers and investors, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur platform systems are mirrored between two third-party owned and operated facilities. Our primary location is in Las Vegas, Nevada and is operated by Switch, Inc. Our secondary location is located in Santa Clara, California and is operated by CenturyLink. Our operations depend on each provider\u2019s ability to protect its and our systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental conditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events. If our arrangement with either provider is terminated or if there is a lapse of service or damage to their facilities, we could experience interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities.\nAny interruptions or delays in our technology systems or service, whether as a result of third-party error, our error, natural disasters, terrorism, other man-made problems, or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with our borrowers and investors and our reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause borrowers and investors to abandon our lending marketplace, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFraudulent activity associated with our lending marketplace could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our loan products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with our lending marketplace, issuing bank(s), borrowers, investors and third parties handling borrower and investor information. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. Under our agreements with investors, we are obligated to repurchase loans in cases of confirmed identity theft. The level of our fraud charge-offs and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. High profile fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs.\nIn addition, in the past, third parties have attempted to defraud individuals, some of whom may be potential customers of ours, by misappropriating our logos and represented themselves as LendingClub in e-mail campaigns to e-mail addresses that have been obtained outside of LendingClub. In one particular scheme, these third parties have represented to individuals that they may obtain a loan if they pay an \u201cadvance fee.\u201d Individuals who believe that the campaigns are genuine may forward funds to these unaffiliated third parties. We take steps to prevent these\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nand other third-party fraud schemes; however, we cannot always be successful in preventing individuals from suffering losses in these schemes. Individuals who suffer damages due to the actions of these unaffiliated third parties may negatively view LendingClub, causing damage to our brand and reputation and reducing our business.\nWe are exposed to cyber-attacks, data breaches, internal employee and other insider misconduct, computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions that may adversely impact our ability to protect the confidential information of our borrowers and our investors and that could adversely impact our reputation, business approach and financial performance.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers\u2019 personal data, including financial information of borrowers and investors. The highly automated nature of our lending marketplace, our reliance on digital technologies and the types and amount of data collected, stored and processed on our systems make us an attractive target and subject to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. In addition, in certain circumstances we utilize third-party vendors, including cloud applications and services, to facilitate the servicing of borrower and investor accounts. Under these arrangements, these third-party vendors require access to certain customer data for the purpose of servicing the accounts. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we have access to, our security measures or those of our third-party vendors are subject to breach. These security breaches and other unauthorized access to our lending marketplace and servicing systems can result in confidential borrower and investor information being stolen and potentially used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. Breaches of our security measures because of third-party action, employee error, third-party vendor error, malfeasance or otherwise, or because of design flaws in our software that are exposed and exploited, could adversely impact our relationships with borrowers and investors, and we could incur significant liability.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or customers\u2019 data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until after they have been launched against a target. Unauthorized parties can and have attempted to gain access to our systems and facilities through various means, including, among others, hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners or customers, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect. Computer malware, viruses and hacking, phishing and denial of service attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry, and have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. Although to date the Company has not suffered material costs or disruption to our business caused by any such incident, any future security breach could have a material adverse impact on our relationships with our borrowers and our reputation, business operations and financial performance.\nFederal and state regulators and many federal and state regulations require notice if data security breaches involve certain personal data. The notice may be difficult to provide in a timely fashion for many reasons, including due to the complexity of gathering, verifying and analyzing relevant information. Furthermore, these mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause borrowers and investors to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, we could lose borrowers, investors and ecosystem partners and our business and operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our insurance policies carry a self-insured retention and coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.\nCyber-attacks suffered by third parties could negatively affect our business.\nWe utilize certain information provided by third parties to facilitate the marketing, distribution, servicing and collection of loans. A cyber-attack suffered by a third-party that provides data to us could impact our ability to\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nmarket, distribute, service or collect for borrowers or investors. For example, Equifax announced a significant cyber breach that impacted millions of consumers. We utilize certain information from Equifax to allow us to market our products through pre-screened offers to qualified borrowers. If a consumer elects to \u201cfreeze\u201d their credit data, we will not be able to access their information to make these pre-screened offers.\nIn addition, if consumers cease to trust credit reporting agencies or other third-party data providers because of cyber-attacks, they may be less willing to participate in borrowing or investing activities generally, which could impact our business. Further, as a result of the release of personally identifiable information from a third-party platform, we could experience an increase in fraudulent loan applications or investor accounts. Under our policies, we reimburse investors for any loan obtained as a result of a verified identity fraud and any increase in identity theft could result in increased reimbursement costs.\nOur business may be adversely affected if our risk management framework does not effectively identify, assess and mitigate risk.\nOur risk management framework seeks to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate our risks. We have established policies and procedures intended to regularly identify and assess our risk profile, including credit risk, pricing risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and operational risk, and then implement appropriate processes and controls to mitigate the risk.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify, assess and/or mitigate our risk profile, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, assessment of our risk profile depends, in part, upon the use of forecasting models. If these models are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate, we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the information we use may be inaccurate or incomplete, both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid. Additionally, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated.\nFailure to maintain, protect and promote our brand may harm our business.\nMaintaining, protecting and promoting our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and expanding our base of borrowers and investors. Maintaining, protecting and promoting our brand depends on many factors, including our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure and innovative products and services, as well as our ability to maintain trust.\nOur brand can be harmed in many ways, including failure by us or our partners to satisfy expectations of service and quality, inadequate protection of sensitive information, failure to maintain or provide adequate or accurate documentation and/or disclosures, compliance failures, failure to comply with contractual obligations, regulatory requests, inquiries or proceedings, litigation and other claims, employee misconduct and misconduct by our partners. We have also been, and may in the future be, the target of incomplete, inaccurate and/or misleading statements about our company, our business, and/or our products and services. Furthermore, our ability to maintain, protect and promote our brand is partially dependent on visibility and customer reviews on third-party platforms. Changes in the way these platforms operate could make the maintenance, protection and promotion of our products and services and our brand more expensive or more difficult. If we do not successfully maintain, protect and promote our brand we may be unable to maintain and/or expand our base of borrowers and investors, which may materially harm our business.\nThird party service disruptions may prevent us from being able to score and decision loan applicants, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe credit decisioning and scoring models we utilize are based on algorithms that evaluate a number of factors and currently depend on sourcing certain information from third parties, including consumer reporting agencies such as TransUnion, Experian or Equifax. In the event that any third party from which we source information experiences a\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nservice disruption, whether as a result of maintenance, error, natural disasters, terrorism or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, our ability to score and decision loan applications may be adversely impacted. This may result in us being unable to approve otherwise qualified applicants, which may adversely impact our business by negatively impacting our reputation and reducing the number of loans we are able to facilitate.\nNegative publicity and unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business.\nNegative publicity about our industry or our company, including with respect to the quality and reliability of our lending marketplace, effectiveness of the credit decisioning or scoring models used in the lending marketplace, the effectiveness of our collection efforts, statements regarding investment returns, changes to our lending marketplace, our ability to grow our borrower and investor base at a rate expected by the market, our ability to effectively manage and resolve borrower and investor complaints, our ability to manage borrower and investor accounts in compliance with regulatory requirements which may not be clear, privacy and security practices, use of loan proceeds by certain borrowers of ours or other companies in our industry for illegal purposes, litigation, regulatory activity and the experience of borrowers and investors with our lending marketplace or services, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in, and the use of, our lending marketplace, which could harm our business and operating results. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners or partners of partners, other online lending marketplaces, outsourced service providers or other counterparties, failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of borrower and investor information and compliance failures and claims.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. There are federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous U.S. and international jurisdictions, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. This regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, which creates uncertainty. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which becomes effective January 1, 2020, imposes more stringent requirements with respect to California data privacy. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We also obtain consent from our borrowers to share information under certain conditions. Our failure, real or perceived, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or foreign laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation, discourage potential borrowers or investors from using our lending marketplace or result in fines or proceedings brought against us, our issuing banks or other third parties by governmental agencies, borrowers, investors or other third parties, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to laws, regulations and other applicable common law rules regarding privacy and privacy advocacy, industry groups or other private parties may propose new and different privacy standards. We could also be subject to liability for the inappropriate use of information made available by us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws and privacy standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws or privacy standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability for us, damage our reputation, inhibit use of our lending marketplace and harm our business.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nRisk retention rules may increase our compliance costs, impair our liquidity and otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have been using, and may increasingly use, securitizations and other structured program transactions, like our CLUB Certificates, as a source of liquidity and financing for our business. Such transactions provide us with additional sources of investor demand for the consumer loans facilitated through our platform. If credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruptions, regulatory requirements or other factors impede our ability to complete additional structured program transactions on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to fund our business may be adversely affected.\nEffective as of December 24, 2016, \u201crisk retention\u201d rules promulgated by U.S. federal regulators under the Dodd-Frank Act (the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) require a \u201csecuritizer\u201d or \u201csponsor\u201d of a securitization transaction to retain, directly or through a \u201cmajority-owned affiliate\u201d (each as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules), in one or more prescribed forms, at least 5% of the credit risk of the securitized assets. For the securitization transactions for which we have acted as \u201csponsor,\u201d we have sought to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules by retaining a \u201cvertical interest\u201d (as defined in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) through either a majority-owned affiliate (MOA) or directly on our balance sheet. For any CLUB Certificate transactions, we have sought to satisfy the U.S. Risk Retention Rules by retaining a 5% interest in the CLUB Certificate issued by the applicable series trust. In addition to the discussion in this section, see \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Basis of Presentation\u201d and \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7. Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities.\u201d In addition, in order to facilitate certain investor offerings in Europe, we structured certain of the securitization transactions for which we acted as \u201csponsor\u201d prior to January 1, 2019 so they complied with the risk retention and ongoing monitoring and diligence requirements of (i) Articles 404-410 of the European Capital Requirements Regulation, as supplemented by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 625/2014 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 602/2014 (the CRR Requirements), (ii) Article 17 of the European Union Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and Articles 50-56 of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulation (EU) No. 231/2013 (the AIFM Requirements), and (iii) Article 135(2) of EU Directive 2009/138/EC, as supplemented by Articles 254-257 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/35 (the Solvency II Requirements, together with the CRR Requirements and the Solvency II Requirements, the Old EU Risk Retention Rules). We have sought to satisfy the Old EU Risk Retention Rules with respect to such securitization transactions by retaining a \u201cmaterial net economic interest\u201d (as defined in the Old EU Risk Retention Rules) directly on our balance sheet.\nThe Old EU Risk Retention Rules were replaced by new requirements that will be applicable to securitizations in respect of which the relevant securities are issued on or after January 1, 2019. For securitizations in respect of which the relevant securities were issued before January 1, 2019, the Old EU Risk Retention Rules will continue to apply. The new requirements were adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union as Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of December 12, 2017 (the New EU Risk Retention Rules, together with the Old EU Risk Retention Rules and the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Risk Retention Rules). There can be no assurance that our securitizations issued after January 1, 2019 will comply with the New EU Risk Retention Rules or new EU due diligence and transparency requirements which may have a negative effect on our ability to complete additional securitization transactions.\nWe have also participated in other securitizations for which we have determined that we are not the \u201csponsor,\u201d and accordingly, we have not sought to comply with any Risk Retention Rules that would be applicable to the \u201csponsor\u201d of those transactions. The Risk Retention Rules are subject to varying interpretations, and one or more regulatory or governmental authorities could take positions with respect to the Risk Retention Rules that conflict with, or are inconsistent with, the Risk Retention Rules as understood or interpreted by us, the securitization industry generally, or past or current regulatory or governmental authorities. There can be no assurance that applicable regulatory or governmental authorities will agree with any of our determinations described above, and if such authorities disagree with such determinations, we may be exposed to additional costs and expenses, in addition to potential liability. Furthermore, we expect that compliance with the Risk Retention Rules (and other related laws and regulations), as\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\ncurrently understood by us, may entail the implementation of new forms, processes, procedures, controls and infrastructure. Such implementation may be costly and may adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition to the increased costs we expect to be generated by our efforts to comply with applicable Risk Retention Rules, which may be significant, we expect compliance with any applicable Risk Retention Rules will tie up our capital, which could potentially have been deployed in other ways that could have generated better value for our shareholders. Holding risk retention interests or loans in contemplation of structured financing increases our exposure to the performance of the loans that underlie or are expected to underlie those transactions. Accordingly, although compliance with applicable Risk Retention Rules would be expected to more closely align our incentives with those of the investors in our loans, it is also expected that poor loan performance may have a heightened adverse effect on the value of our shares. This may exacerbate the negative effects of poor loan performance on the value of our shares.\nIf we breach representations or warranties that we made in our securitization, whole loan or CLUB Certificate transactions, or if either we suffer a direct or indirect loss in our retained interests in these transactions, our financial condition could be harmed.\nWe sponsor a number of sales of unsecured personal whole loans through asset-backed securitizations. In connection with these securitizations, as well as our whole loan and CLUB Certificate transactions, we make certain customary representations, warranties and covenants. If there is a breach of those representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the value of the subject loans, then we will be required to either cure the breach, repurchase the affected loans from the purchasing entity, replace the affected loans with other loans or make a loss of value payment, as the case may be. Any losses that result could be material and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFor a description of the interests we have retained in connection with complying with risk retention rules applicable to us as a sponsor of securitization transactions, see \u201cRisk retention rules may increase our compliance costs, impair our liquidity and otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\u201d In the event that we suffer losses on all or a portion of the interests in any securitization transaction that we have retained (whether to comply with applicable risk retention rules or otherwise), our financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may enter into similar transactions in the future and those transactions are likely to entail similar and other substantial risks.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may evaluate and consider strategic transactions, combinations, acquisitions, dispositions or alliances. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business opportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain the benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nAny strategic transaction, combination, acquisition, disposition or alliance will involve risks encountered in business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and resources from our normal daily operations;\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\n\u2022\ndifficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our platform;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nregulatory risks, including remaining in good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any necessary pre-closing or post-closing approvals, as well as being subject to new regulators with oversight over an acquired business;\n\u2022\nassumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired or disposed of business before the acquisition or disposition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, regulatory actions, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in separating assets and replacing shared services;\n\u2022\nassumption of exposure to performance of any acquired loan portfolios;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions to our ongoing businesses; and\n\u2022\nunexpected costs and unknown risks and liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nWe may not make any transactions, combinations, acquisitions, dispositions or alliances, or any future transactions, combinations, acquisitions, dispositions or alliances may not be successful, may not benefit our business strategy, may not generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. Any transactions, combinations, acquisitions, dispositions or alliances may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and the interests of holders of our indebtedness. In addition, we cannot assure you that any future acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced loan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nIf we were required to register as a broker-dealer under federal or state law, our costs could significantly increase or our operations could be impaired.\nWe issue securities and, in certain instances, offer them directly to investors. We are not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC nor do we operate as a registered broker-dealer in any jurisdiction. This limits the methods and manners by which we may market and sell our securities. If a regulatory body were to find that our activities require us to register as a broker-dealer or to market and sell our securities only through a registered broker-dealer, we may have to constrain our current business activities and we could be subject to fines, rescission offers or other penalties, and our compliance costs and other costs of operation could increase significantly, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and may incur net losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $517.7 million. Our operating expenses may continue to be elevated as we resolve additional matters that arose from legacy management (including indemnification legal expenses paid by the Company for former employees), settle regulatory investigations and examinations, enhance our compliance systems, reestablish the growth of our business, attract borrowers, investors and partners, and further enhance and develop our loan products, lending marketplace and platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. We may incur additional net losses in the future and may not maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nWe may have to constrain our business activities to avoid being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIn general, a company that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (Investment Company Act). The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe we have conducted, and we intend to continue to conduct, our business in a manner that does not result in our company being characterized as an investment company. To avoid being deemed an investment company, we may decide not to broaden our offerings, which could require us to forego attractive opportunities. We may also apply for formal exemptive relief to provide additional clarity on our status under the Investment Company Act. We may not receive such relief on a timely basis, if at all, and such relief may require us to modify or curtail our operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute additional compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to offer investors a satisfactory breadth and volume of investment opportunities, our business and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nWe invest in our lending marketplace platform and regularly iterate our processes to provide improved and more efficient investment opportunities, which includes efforts to provide investors the opportunity to invest in a broad selection of loans. However, various factors may contribute to certain loans being available only in a limited quantity or being entirely unavailable to certain investors.\nWith respect to our member payment dependent notes, our lending marketplace platform allows investors to select which loans to invest in manually, via an application program interface (API) or by using our automated investing service which selects notes based on investment criteria selected by the investor. Loans selected for investment by a particular investor or group of investors may not be available for investment to other investors. This variability in the availability of loans for investment may cause returns to vary from investor to investor. For example, certain loans selected via API or by manual investors may be unavailable when the automated investing service orders are placed and therefore returns of manual investors or investors utilizing API may vary from, and be higher than, the returns from our automated investing service if manual investors or investors utilizing API are able to identify and select higher performing loans.\nIn addition, some of our agreements with platform investors contain provisions regarding the manner in which our lending marketplace platform product operates that could constrain the manner in which our lending marketplace platform product can develop, particularly with respect to how loans are selected for investment. Some of these agreements provide for significant damages in the event of a breach and some provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. These agreements could constrain the development of our lending marketplace, including efforts to offer a breadth of investment opportunities for and among a variety of investors, and/or result in significant damages that could impact our results in a given period.\nIf investors, automated or otherwise, are unable to invest in certain categories of loans, are unable to invest at the volume they desire, perceive that they are not offered the same investment opportunities as other investors and/or are dissatisfied with the risk-adjusted return they receive from investing on our platform, they may seek alternative investments from ours which may materially harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain our highly skilled employees needed to support our business, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nWe believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our employees, including software engineers, financial, credit and risk personnel and marketing professionals. Our future success depends on our continued ability to\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nattract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled technical and financial personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is extremely intense. We have had a high attrition rate from employees and have seen that attrition rate increase. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. Additionally, changes in U.S. immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for certain highly skilled employees that we have hired or are recruiting.\nIn addition to attracting and retaining highly skilled employees in general, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, senior management team and other key personnel, all of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, and the process to replace any of them, would involve significant time and expense and distraction that may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or impair our operations or results.\nOur business operations may be adversely impacted by political events, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters, labor disputes and other business interruptions.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by, among other things, political events, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters, labor disputes and other events which could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver a satisfactory experience to our borrowers and investors, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a federal government shutdown could impair our ability to support our structured program initiatives and/or resolve outstanding litigation or regulatory inquiries with the federal government.\nFurthermore, in the event of any disruption to our operations or those of the companies with whom we do business with, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nAspects of our platform include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, GNU General Public License and the Apache License. Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses. Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and loan products. There can be no assurance that efforts we take to monitor the use of open source software to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur platform and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nof data. The software on which we rely has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for borrowers and investors, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in errors or compromise our ability to protect borrower or investor data or our intellectual property. Any errors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in harm to our reputation, loss of borrowers or investors, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nMisconduct and errors by our employees and third-party service providers could harm our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees and other third-party service providers. Our business depends on our employees and third-party service providers to facilitate the operation of our business and process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, and if any of our employees or third-party service providers provide unsatisfactory service or take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to follow protocol when interacting with borrowers and investors, we could lose customers, harm our reputation, be liable for damages, be subject to repurchase obligations and be subject to complaints, regulatory actions and penalties.\nWhile we have internal procedures and oversight functions to protect the Company against this risk, we could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability.\nAny of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to borrowers and investors, inability to attract future borrowers and investors, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInvestors in CLUB Certificates offered by the Company may be deemed to have been solicited by general solicitation or general advertising, and such investors could seek to rescind their purchase.\nWe offer member payment dependent notes publicly pursuant to the Note Registration Statement. In addition, the Company sells CLUB Certificates. Sales of CLUB Certificates are made through private transactions with investors and are separate from the public offering of the member payment dependent notes. Because of the fact-specific nature of what types of activities might constitute a general solicitation or general advertising, it is possible that some of the CLUB Certificate investors could assert that they became interested in an investment in CLUB Certificates through a general solicitation or general advertising with regard to CLUB Certificates or through the public offering of member payment dependent notes. If it was determined that an investor\u2019s interest in the CLUB Certificates was the result of a general solicitation or general advertisement, the investor could claim that the sale of CLUB Certificates violated Section 5 of the Securities Act and could seek to rescind their purchase or seek other remedies, subject to any applicable statute of limitations. We would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the Securities Act occurred, however, litigation is inherently uncertain and can be expensive and time consuming.\nWe have not reviewed our compliance with foreign laws regarding the participation of non-U.S. residents on our lending marketplace.\nFrom time to time, non-U.S. residents invest in loans directly through our lending marketplace. We are not experts with respect to all applicable laws in the various foreign jurisdictions from which an investor may be located, and we cannot be sure that we are complying with applicable foreign laws. Failure to comply with such laws could result in fines and penalties payable by us, which could reduce our profitability or cause us to modify or delay planned expansions and expenditures, including investments in our growth. In addition, any such fines and penalties could create negative publicity, result in additional regulatory oversight that could limit our operations and ability to succeed, or otherwise hinder our plans to expand our business internationally.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations that could subject our business to higher tax liabilities.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted on December 22, 2017, makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. While future interpretative guidance of the Tax Act and how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal law changes may have an impact on our business, the Tax Act\u2019s reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, has reduced our deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize our NOLs.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law.\nWe assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, a full valuation allowance has historically been recorded to recognize only deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\nFinally, further changes to the federal or state tax laws or technical guidance relating to the Tax Act that would further reduce the corporate tax rate could operate to effectively reduce or eliminate the value of any deferred tax asset. Our tax attributes as of December 31, 2018 may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nOur credit facilities provide our lenders with first-priority liens against substantially all of our assets and contain certain affirmative and negative covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have certain credit facilities that contain restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters. These restrictive covenants may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to perform under the loan agreements for these credit facilities by, for example, failing to make timely payments or failing to comply with the required total leverage ratio, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements, see \u201cPart II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14. Debt\u201d included in this Report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has declined significantly since the end of the first quarter of 2016 and has exhibited substantial volatility. Our stock price may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; changes in the credit performance on our platform; the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; progress and resolution with respect to existing litigation and regulatory inquiries; significant transactions, or new features, products or services by us or our competitors; changes in\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nfinancial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; media coverage of our business and financial performance; the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; and general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock, including us, have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been the target of this type of litigation and may continue to be a target in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the longer term underlying performance of our business.\nOur operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. The increased use of our balance sheet and the timing of capital markets transactions has had an impact on the quarterly performance of the business in recent quarters, leading us to reduce the earnings guidance or perform below the expectation of equity investors in a given period. Fluctuation in quarterly results may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIf we were to become subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the right of payment of investors in our member payment dependent notes may be senior to the right of payment of our stockholders and there may not be value recoverable by our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the member payment dependent notes offered through our lending marketplace, we are obligated to pay principal and interest on each member payment dependent note on a non-recourse basis only if and to the extent that we receive principal, interest or late fee payments from the borrower on the corresponding loan, but the member payment dependent notes become fully recourse to us if we fail to pay such obligation, which would include being prohibited from making such payments as a result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, or if we breach a covenant under the indenture governing the member payment dependent notes. In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding due to a default under current or future indebtedness, an action for repurchase or rescission of securities or other event, there is uncertainty regarding whether a holder of a member payment dependent note has any right of payment from our assets other than the corresponding loan. It is possible that a member payment dependent note holder could be deemed to have a right of payment from both the corresponding loan and from some or all of our other assets, in which case the member payment dependent note holder would have a claim to the proceeds of our assets that is senior to any right of payment of the holders of our common stock, regardless of whether we have received any payments from the underlying borrower, making it highly unlikely that there would be any value recoverable by our stockholders.\nWe are subject to ownership concentration by certain significant stockholders.\nOwnership of our common stock is concentrated among certain stockholders. For example, per filings with the SEC, Shanda Investment Group Limited beneficially owns shares of our common stock representing approximately 23% of LendingClub Corporation\u2019s voting power as of March 1, 2018. We do not have any restrictions on any\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nstockholder in favor of LendingClub Corporation other than as may be required by applicable law. Any single stockholder with a significant concentration could determine to vote shares in a manner that may be contrary to the interests of other minority stockholders, or such stockholder could sell shares in a manner that could affect our stock price. In addition, the concentration of shares may act as a deterrent to other potential investors purchasing our stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur restated Certificate of Incorporation and restated Bylaws contain provisions that can have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. The provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire two-thirds vote to amend some provisions in our restated Certificate of Incorporation and restated Bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require that all stockholder actions must be taken at a stockholder meeting;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nResearch and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business may be consumed by equity investors and influence their opinion of our business and/or investment in our common stock. For example, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price may decline. Additionally, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAdditional stock issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders and may place downward pressure on our stock price.\nWe may issue additional equity securities to raise capital, support acquisitions, or for a variety of other purposes. We also utilize equity-based compensation as an important tool in recruiting and retaining employees and other service providers. Additional issuances of our stock may be made pursuant to the exercise or vesting of new or existing stock options or restricted stock units, respectively. Dilution to existing holders of our common stock from equity-based compensation and other additional issuances could be substantial and may place downward pressure on our stock price.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an investor may only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the trading price of our common stock increases.", "PERMNO": 15092, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "LC"}
