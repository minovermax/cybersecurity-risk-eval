{"cik": "1082554", "company": "UNITED THERAPEUTICS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Products and Our Operations\nWe rely heavily on sales of Tyvaso, Remodulin, and Orenitram to generate revenues and support our operations.\nSales of Tyvaso, Remodulin, and Orenitram comprise the vast majority of our revenues. Substantially decreased sales of any of these products could have a material adverse impact on our operations. A wide variety of events, such as withdrawal of regulatory approvals or substantial changes in prescribing practices or dosing patterns, many of which are described in other risk factors below, could cause sales of these products to materially decline, or to grow more slowly than expected. The current and expected availability of generic versions of our products has decreased and may continue to decrease our revenues. The approval of new therapies, such as Yutrepia, may negatively impact sales of our current and potential new products. Sales may decrease if any third party that manufactures, markets, distributes, or sells our commercial products cannot do so satisfactorily, or we cannot manage our internal manufacturing processes. Finally, if we are not able to successfully launch Tyvaso DPI when we anticipate, or at all, for regulatory or other reasons, or demand for Tyvaso DPI following its launch does not meet our expectations, the revenue opportunity for our treprostinil products could be significantly lower than we expect.\nIf our products fail in clinical trials, we will be unable to sell those products.\nTo obtain approvals from the FDA and international regulatory agencies to sell new products, or to expand the product labeling for our existing products, we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective. Regulators have substantial discretion over the approval process. Regulators may require us to amend ongoing trials or perform additional trials, which have in the past and could in the future result in significant delays and additional costs and may be unsuccessful. Delays and costs associated with regulatory requirements to change or add trials may cause us to discontinue efforts to develop a product, as they did with Trevyent and the ISR. If our clinical trials are not successful, or we fail to address identified deficiencies adequately, we will not obtain required approvals to market the new product or new indication. We cannot predict with certainty how long it will take, or how much it will cost, to complete necessary clinical trials or obtain regulatory approvals of our current or future products. The time and cost needed to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals varies by product, indication, and country. In addition, failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approval has in the past and could in the future require us to recognize impairment charges.\nOur clinical trials have in the past and may in the future be discontinued, delayed, canceled, or disqualified for various reasons, including: (1) the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially caused us to suspend enrollment of most of our clinical studies, and may do so again; (2) the drug is ineffective, or physicians and/or patients believe that the drug is ineffective, or that other therapies are more effective or convenient; (3) patients do not enroll in or complete clinical trials at the rate we expect; (4) clinical trial sites or third parties do not adhere to trial protocols and required quality controls under good clinical practices (GCP) regulations and similar regulations outside the United States; (5) patients experience severe side effects during treatment or die during our trials because of adverse events; and (6) the results of clinical trials conducted in a particular country are not acceptable to regulators in other countries.\nWe may not compete successfully with established or newly developed drugs or products.\nCompetition could negatively impact our operating results. We compete with well-established drug companies for market share, as well as, among other things, funding, licenses, expertise, personnel, clinical trial patients and investigators, consultants, and third-party collaborators. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and technical resources, and a larger number of approved products, than we do. Many of these competitors also possess greater experience in areas critical to success such as research and development, clinical trials, sales and marketing, and regulatory matters.\nNumerous treatments currently compete with our commercial therapies. For example, for treatment of PAH, we compete with over fifteen branded and generic drugs. Sales of a generic version of Adcirca launched in August 2018 have had a material adverse impact on our sales of Adcirca. The availability of generic versions of Remodulin in the United States could materially impact our revenues, and generic competition has materially impacted our Remodulin revenues outside the United States. Our competitors are also developing new products that may compete with ours. For example, Liquidia is developing Yutrepia, which if successful would compete directly with Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI (if approved), and our other treprostinil-based products.\nPatients and doctors may discontinue use of our products if they perceive competing products as safer, more effective, less invasive, more convenient, and/or less expensive than ours. Doctors may reduce the prescribed doses of our products if they prescribe them in combination with competing products. In addition, many competing therapies are less invasive or more convenient than our products, and use of these competing therapies often delays or prevents initiation of our therapies.\n2021 Annual Report 33\nThe successful commercialization of our products depends on the availability of coverage and adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governmental authorities and private health insurers. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may negatively impact our sales.\nThe commercial success of our products depends, in significant part, on coverage by governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance companies. A reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from domestic or foreign government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Government payers and/or third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit the price of medicinal products and frequently challenge the pricing of new or expensive drugs. In many markets outside the United States, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes, and profit control. Financial pressures may cause United States government payers and/or private health insurers to implement policies that would reduce reimbursement rates for our products, limit future price increases, cap reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals to rates paid internationally, require the automatic substitution of generic products, demand more rigorous requirements for initial coverage for new products, implement step therapy policies that require patients to try other medicines, including generic products, before using our products, or take other similar steps that could make it more difficult for patients to access our products.\nOur prostacyclin analogue products (Tyvaso, Remodulin, and Orenitram) and our oncology product (Unituxin) are expensive therapies. Our specialty pharmacy distributors may not be able to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products from commercial and government payers to motivate them to support our products. Third-party payers may reduce the amount of reimbursement for our products based on changes in pricing of other therapies for the same disease or the development of new payment methodologies to cover and reimburse treatment costs, such as the use of cost-effectiveness research or value-based payment contracts. Third-party payers often encourage the use of less-expensive generic alternative therapies, which has materially impacted our Adcirca revenues and which may materially impact our Remodulin revenues. If commercial and/or government payers do not cover our products or limit payment rates, patients and physicians could choose covered competing products and may have lower out-of-pocket costs.\nOur manufacturing strategy exposes us to significant risks.\nWe must be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our commercial products to satisfy demand. We manufacture Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso, and Unituxin, including the active ingredient in each of these products, at our own facilities and rely on third parties for additional manufacturing capacity for Remodulin and Tyvaso. We rely on a variety of third-party sole manufacturers for certain elements of our commercial and development-stage products, as detailed under the risk factor below entitled, We rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business. If any of our internal or third-party manufacturing and supply arrangements are interrupted for compliance issues, issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or other reasons, we may not have sufficient inventory to meet future demand. Changes in suppliers and/or service providers could interrupt the manufacturing of our commercial products and impede the progress of our commercial launch plans and clinical trials.\nOur internal manufacturing process subjects us to risks as we engage in increasingly complex manufacturing processes. We manufacture our entire supply of Orenitram and Unituxin without an FDA-approved back-up manufacturing site, and do not plan to engage a third party to manufacture these materials. Our long-term organ manufacturing programs will involve exceptionally complicated manufacturing processes, many of which have never been attempted on a clinical or commercial scale. It will take substantial time and resources to develop and implement such manufacturing processes, and we may never be able to do so successfully. Additional risks of our manufacturing strategy include the following:\n\u2022We, our third-party manufacturers, and other third parties involved in the manufacturing process, such as third parties that operate testing and storage facilities, are subject to the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practices regulations, current good tissue practices, and similar international regulatory standards, and other quality standards related to device manufacturing. Our ability to exercise control over regulatory compliance by our third-party manufacturers is limited.\n\u2022We may experience difficulty designing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations as we develop manufacturing operations for new products.\n\u2022Natural and man-made disasters (such as fires, contamination, power loss, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, terrorist attacks, and acts of war), disease outbreaks, and pandemics such as COVID-19 impacting our internal and third-party manufacturing sites could cause a supply disruption.\n\u2022Even if we, our third-party manufacturers, and other third parties involved in the manufacturing process comply with applicable drug and device manufacturing regulations, the sterility and quality of our products could be substandard and such products could not be sold or used or could be subject to recalls.\n\u2022The FDA and its international counterparts would require new testing and compliance inspections of new manufacturers of our products, or new manufacturing facilities we operate.\n\u2022The FDA and other regulatory agencies may not be able to timely inspect our facilities, or those of our third-party manufacturers, due to COVID-19-related delays or other reasons, which could result in delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for our products.\n\u2022We may be unable to contract with needed manufacturers on satisfactory terms or at all.\nUnited Therapeutics, a public benefit corporation\n\u2022The supply of materials and components necessary to manufacture and package our products may become scarce or unavailable, which could delay the manufacturing and subsequent sale of such products. Products manufactured with substituted materials or components must be approved by the FDA and applicable international regulatory agencies before they could be sold.\n\u2022Our business partners who manufacture the devices to deliver our products are subject to the FDA\u2019s medical device requirements. Any non-compliance, recall, or enforcement action issued against them could adversely impact our sales and operations.\n\u2022The infrastructure of our internal manufacturing facilities, along with certain facilities of our third-party manufacturers, is aging. These facilities have highly sophisticated and complex utility systems. If any of these systems requires long-term repair or replacement, the impacted facility may not be able to manufacture product for a substantial period of time.\n\u2022We, along with our third-party manufacturers, rely upon local municipalities to supply our facilities with clean water, which is processed into high purity water and used as a key ingredient for three of our commercial drug products. If local municipalities are unable to supply water that meets relevant quality standards, we and our third-party manufacturers may be unable to manufacture product until such a situation is remediated.\n\u2022Our supply chain for raw materials and consumables extends worldwide and is complex. Suppliers based in China play a substantial role in our supply chain. Political unrest or trade disputes involving China or other countries in our supply chain could impact our ability and the ability of our third-manufacturers to source raw materials and consumables.\nAny of these factors could disrupt sales of our commercial products, delay clinical trials or commercialization of new products, result in product liability claims and product recalls, and entail higher costs. Interruptions in our manufacturing process could be significant given the length of time and complexity involved in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for alternative arrangements, through either third parties or internal manufacturing processes.\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt our operations and/or business for an unknown period of time.\nOur business, operations, financial results, liquidity, and stock price could be adversely impacted by the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of such impact, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we cannot currently accurately predict or assess, including, among others: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including the emergence of new strains, such as the \u201cDelta\u201d, \u201cOmicron\u201d, and future variants; its impact on global and regional healthcare infrastructure, and the ability of patients to obtain medical care; the negative impact on global and regional economies and economic activity; actions governments, businesses, and individuals take in response to the pandemic; the roll-out and long-term safety and efficacy of vaccines; and how quickly economies and medical systems recover after the pandemic subsides. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing/self-isolation, the burden the pandemic has placed on healthcare infrastructure, workplace and physician office closures, travel disruptions, quarantines, and other factors, which could cause, among other things:\n\u2022Interruption of our development pipeline. Approvals of new products we are developing, potential label expansions for existing products, and the launch of newly-approved products may be delayed or hindered, which would harm our revenue growth prospects. For example, pandemic-related supply issues delayed our launch of the Remunity Pump. In addition, enrollment in many of our clinical trials was suspended as a result of the onset of the pandemic. Although enrollment in these studies has resumed, we may experience further delays or difficulties, including delays or difficulties with clinical site initiation and recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff. Our clinical trials, including the integrity and completeness of subject data and clinical study endpoints, may also be impacted or delayed by: (1) diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials due to changes in hospital or research institution policies, governmental regulations, prioritization of hospital and other medical resources toward efforts to cope with the pandemic, or other reasons related to the pandemic; (2) interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by governments, employers, and others, or other interruption of clinical trial participant visits and study procedures; or (3) any supply interruptions of our investigational drug candidates or other study materials due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns, or stoppages and disruptions in distribution systems. In addition, our pipeline may be delayed by interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which are extremely busy responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any prolongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our new products and label expansions.\n\u2022A decrease in revenues from our existing products. COVID-19 made it difficult or impossible for many patients to visit their physicians\u2019 offices to determine whether our medicines may be appropriate. As a result, in April 2020 we experienced a temporary decline in the number of new patients starting our treprostinil-based medicines. While new patient starts have returned to pre-pandemic levels, a decline could recur as the COVID-19 pandemic continues or if the pandemic causes access to medical care to become further restricted, which could cause a negative impact on our revenues. The potential inability of patients to visit their physicians\u2019 offices or receive required diagnostic testing to ensure reimbursement for our therapies or any inability of specialty pharmacy nurses to visit patients as appropriate to provide training and assistance with the use of our therapies, may also cause existing patients to stop using our medicines or prevent new patients from starting to use our medicines. In addition, virtual meetings by our commercial field-based teams with prescribing physicians may not be as effective as in-person meetings, which may negatively impact how often physicians prescribe our medicines. Any disruption of our supply chain caused by COVID-19 could also negatively impact our revenues.\n2021 Annual Report 35\n\u2022Disruption of our operations. COVID-19 could disrupt many aspects of our operations, which could harm our business and prospects. Although we implemented a mandatory vaccine requirement in September 2021 for all staff, subject to certain medical and religious exemptions, we continue to maintain a flexible work-from-home policy for all personnel excluding those necessary to maintain minimum basic operations. Our reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. Working remotely may also increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, manufacturing sites, clinical trial sites, and other third parties. Further, we, and third parties with which we engage to conduct distribution, production, and research and development activities, may experience limitations on the ability to recruit and hire key personnel due to the inability to meet with candidates because of travel restrictions and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders. We and third parties with which we engage also may experience operational challenges caused by sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, or employees working from home. Mass vaccine production and distribution efforts (such as Operation Warp Speed), as well as backlogs at major ports of entry, have impacted availability and lead times for certain materials used in the manufacture of our products. If we, or our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers, are unable to source materials, it may prevent us from manufacturing our products for an indefinite period until such materials become available.\nCOVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors discussed in this Report, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and stock price. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future outbreak of disease, may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks. The possible extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently difficult to predict and will ultimately depend on a number of factors outside our control, including the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic and the resulting economic impact.\nWe rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business.\nThird parties assist us in activities critical to our operations, such as: (1) manufacturing our clinical and commercial products; (2) conducting clinical trials, preclinical studies, and other research and development activities; (3) obtaining regulatory approvals; (4) conducting pharmacovigilance-related and product complaint activities, including drug safety, reporting adverse events, and product complaints; (5) obtaining medical device clearances and approvals for the devices used to deliver our drugs; and (6) marketing and distributing our products. Any disruption in the ability of third parties to continue to perform these critical activities, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. Any change in service providers could interrupt the manufacture and distribution of our products and services, and impede the progress of our clinical trials, commercial launch plans, and related revenues.\nWe rely on various distributors to market, distribute, and sell Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram, and Unituxin. If they are unsuccessful in, or reduce or discontinue, their sales efforts, our revenues may decline materially. Outside the United States, we rely substantially on our international distributors to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our products and to market and sell our products in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the United States, we derive all of our treprostinil revenues from sales to two distributors, Accredo and CVS Specialty. If either of these two distributors places significantly larger or smaller orders in a given time period, our revenues can be materially impacted in a way that does not reflect patient demand.\nLilly manufactures and supplies Adcirca for us. We use Lilly\u2019s pharmaceutical wholesaler network to distribute Adcirca. If Lilly is unable to manufacture or supply Adcirca or its distribution network is disrupted, it could delay, disrupt, or prevent us from selling Adcirca. We rely entirely on third parties to supply pumps and other supplies necessary to deliver Remodulin. There are a limited number of pumps available in the market, and the discontinuation of any particular pump could have a material, adverse impact on our Remodulin revenues if a viable supply of an alternate pump is not available. We rely entirely on Minnetronix Inc. as the sole manufacturer of the Tyvaso Inhalation System. As Tyvaso is a drug-device combination, we cannot sell Tyvaso without the Tyvaso Inhalation System.\nWe rely heavily on MannKind and other third parties to manufacture, test, and store Tyvaso DPI, and to meet all FDA requirements related to the manufacture of Tyvaso DPI. This includes maintaining an FDA-compliant facility and addressing any FDA concerns regarding the manufacturing process. If MannKind is unable to manufacture Tyvaso DPI for us for any reason, our commercial sales of Tyvaso DPI (if approved by the FDA) could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe rely heavily on DEKA and its affiliates for the development, manufacturing, and regulatory approval of the Remunity Pump for Remodulin. Supply disruptions caused by COVID-19 impacted DEKA\u2019s ability to secure certain components and raw materials necessary to manufacture sufficient quantities of Remunity Pumps and accessories, delaying our ability to commence commercial sales. Finally, we also rely on various sole-source suppliers for manufacturing activities related to ralinepag, RemoPro, and other pumps we are developing for Remodulin. For a further discussion of risks created by the use of third-party contract manufacturers, see the risk factor above entitled, Our manufacturing strategy exposes us to significant risks.\nWe rely heavily on third-party contract research organizations, contract laboratories, clinical investigative sites, and other third parties to conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other research and development activities. In addition, the success of certain products we are developing will depend on clinical trials sponsored by third parties. Third-party failure to conduct or assist us in conducting clinical trials in accordance with study protocols, quality controls, GCP, or other applicable requirements\nUnited Therapeutics, a public benefit corporation\nor to submit associated regulatory filings, could limit or prevent our ability to rely on results of those trials in seeking regulatory approvals.\nReports of actual or perceived side effects and adverse events associated with our products could cause our sales to decrease.\nReports of side effects and adverse events associated with our products could affect a physician\u2019s decision to prescribe or a patient\u2019s willingness to use our products, which may have a significant adverse impact on sales of our products. An example of a known risk associated with the delivery system used for intravenous Remodulin is sepsis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria. In addition, Unituxin is associated with severe side effects, and its label contains a boxed warning related to potential infusion reactions and neurotoxicity. We are required to report certain adverse events to the FDA. Development of new products, and new formulations and indications for existing products, could result in new side effects and adverse events which may be serious in nature.\nNegative attention from special interest groups may impair our business.\nOur early-stage research and development involves animal testing required by regulatory authorities, which we conduct both directly and through contracts with third parties. Our xenotransplantation and regenerative medicine programs rely heavily on the use of animals to manufacture and test our products. Certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for research purposes. Any negative attention, threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities could impede the operation of our business.\nWe may not maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect us against significant product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks. We may not be able to maintain our current product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate for all potential claims. If losses significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage, we may experience financial hardship or potentially be forced out of business. Clinical testing and eventual marketing and sale of new products, reformulated versions of existing products, or use of existing products in new indications could expose us to new product liability risks that are not covered by our existing policies.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and qualified scientific and technical personnel, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.\nMembers of our management team, including our founder, Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Martine Rothblatt, play a critical role in defining our business strategy and maintaining our corporate culture. The loss of the services and leadership of Dr. Rothblatt or any other members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance on our senior management team members. Failure to identify, hire, and retain suitable successors for members of our senior management team and to transfer knowledge effectively could impede the achievement of our business objectives. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel in our industries is intense. If we fail to attract and retain such Unitherians, we may not be successful in developing and commercializing new therapies for PAH and other diseases.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance\nWe must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United States and other countries. Failure to obtain approvals on a timely basis or to comply with these requirements could delay, disrupt, or prevent commercialization of our products.\nThe products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory agencies. Our research and development efforts must comply with extensive regulations, including those promulgated by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. The regulatory approval process is particularly uncertain for our transplantation programs, which include the development of xenotransplantation, regenerative medicine, 3-D organ bioprinting, and cell-based products. Once approved, the manufacture, distribution, advertising, and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation, including product labeling, strict pharmacovigilance and adverse event and medical device reporting, complaint processing, storage, distribution, and record-keeping requirements. Our product candidates have in the past and may in the future fail to receive regulatory approval. If granted, product approvals can be conditioned on the completion of post-marketing clinical studies, accompanied by significant restrictions on the use or marketing of a given product and withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, such as post-marketing requirements and post-marketing commitments, or upon the occurrence of adverse events subsequent to commercial introduction. Our ability to obtain FDA approval for our products has been, and in the future may be, materially impacted by the outcome and quality of our clinical trials and other data submitted to regulators, as well as the quality of our manufacturing operations and those of our third-party contract manufacturers and contract laboratories. In addition, third parties may submit citizen petitions to the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval conditions for, our products. If successful, citizen petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of our products. For example, a third party submitted a citizen petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refuse to approve Tyvaso DPI, and/or impose additional requirements in order to approve the product. This has prompted the FDA to request additional information concerning Tyvaso DPI, and to delay the anticipated review deadline for the Tyvaso DPI NDA from February 2022 to May 2022.\n2021 Annual Report 37\nRegulatory approval for our currently marketed products is limited by the FDA and other regulators to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval of our products is limited to specific diseases and indications for which our products have been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. FDA approval is also required for new formulations and new indications for an approved product. While physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those approved by regulatory authorities (called \u201coff-label\u201d uses), our ability to promote our products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. Failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines related to promotion and advertising can result in the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve a product, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, enforcement action, civil lawsuits, or criminal prosecution.\nWe must comply with various laws in jurisdictions around the world that restrict certain marketing practices.\nOur business activities may be subject to challenge under laws in jurisdictions around the world restricting particular marketing practices, such as:\n\u2022Anti-kickback and false claim statutes, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. In the United States, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other activities, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration (i.e., anything of value) to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order or arranging the purchase, lease or order of any health care product or service reimbursable under any federally financed healthcare program like Medicare or Medicaid. This statute is interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, specialty pharmacies, formulary managers, patients, and others. Our practices may not always qualify for safe harbor protection under this statute.\n\u2022The Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Pharmaceutical and health care companies have faced liability under this law for causing false claims to be submitted because they marketed a product for unapproved and non-reimbursable uses.\n\u2022Analogous state laws and regulations, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid or, in several states, regardless of the payer, including private payers.\nCompliance with these and similar laws on a state-by-state basis is difficult, time consuming, and requires substantial resources. Any investigation, inquiry, or other legal proceeding under these laws related to our operations, even if we successfully defend against it, or any penalties imposed upon us for failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or reputation. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include treble civil monetary penalties, payment of damages, fines, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal health care programs, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nGovernment healthcare reform and other reforms could adversely affect our revenue, costs, and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law or government health care programs may adversely impact our business, operations, or financial results. We cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes related to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nPolitical, economic, and regulatory influences may lead to fundamental changes in the U.S. healthcare industry, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription drug costs in the U.S. We expect there will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to commercialize and to sell our products profitably. For example, we anticipate that the Biden Administration, U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and regulators may adopt or accelerate adoption of new healthcare policies and reforms intended to curb healthcare costs, such as federal and state controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs (including in Medicare and Medicaid), new or enhanced requirements to pay prescription drug rebates and penalties to government healthcare programs, and additional pharmaceutical cost transparency measures that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices through required disclosures.\nAt the federal level, there have been and continue to be a number of healthcare-related legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms that significantly affect the pharmaceutical industry. For example, PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and commercial payers, and has significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA is a broad measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health coverage-related mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. The PPACA and certain of its provisions have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. It is unclear how the PPACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the PPACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business.\nAdditionally, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States regarding drug pricing practices. Among other things, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things: bring more transparency to drug pricing; reduce the cost of prescription drugs under government payer programs; review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs; and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued the\nUnited Therapeutics, a public benefit corporation\nMost Favored Nation demonstration project discussed above, and there is also proposed legislation pending that would establish an international reference price-based Medicare Part B drug and biological payment methodology.\nIndividual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement limitations, marketing cost disclosure, and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.\nWe anticipate that the PPACA and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the payment that we receive for any approved product, and adversely impact our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payment from commercial payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Further state and federal healthcare reform measures adopted in the future could limit the amounts that state and federal governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the FDA issued a final rule and guidance concerning two new pathways for importing lower-cost drugs into the United States. The final rule allows certain prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, and the guidance describes procedures for drug manufacturers to facilitate the importation of FDA-approved drugs and biologics manufactured abroad and originally intended for sale in a foreign country into the United States. Additionally, in November 2020, the HHS adopted a rule that will eliminate the safe harbor shielding Medicare Part D rebates to pharmacy benefit managers from the Anti-Kickback Statute. In response to a legal challenge brought by a trade association representing PBMs, the Biden Administration agreed to delay the effective date of the rule until January 1, 2023. It is difficult to predict the impact, if any, of any such legislation or executive actions on the use of and reimbursement for our products in the United States, including the potential for the importation of generic versions of our products.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions, and fines, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe participate in, and have certain price reporting obligations to, the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental programs that require us to pay rebates or offer discounts on our products. Certain programs, such as the 340B program and the VA FSS pricing program, impose limits on the price we are permitted to charge certain entities for our products or for any future products for which we receive regulatory approval. Statutory and regulatory changes regarding these programs and their requirements could negatively affect the coverage and reimbursement by these programs of our products or any future products for which we receive regulatory approval and could negatively impact our results of operations. Our failure to comply with these price reporting, rebate payment, or pricing requirements could adversely impact our financial results. Applicable laws and regulations, including the PPACA, and regulations promulgated thereunder, could affect our obligations in ways we cannot anticipate.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. If we must restate or recalculate information provided under these programs, our costs of compliance could increase. Additionally, we could be held liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data, including retroactive rebates and program refunds. We may incur significant civil monetary penalties if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, to have made a misrepresentation in our reporting of ASP figures, to have knowingly provided false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing, or to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Certain failures to timely submit required data also could result in a civil monetary penalty for each day the information is late. We could also become subject to allegations under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. In addition, misreporting and failure to timely report data to CMS also can be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nCMS, the VA, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot guarantee that our submissions will not be found by CMS, the VA, or other governmental agencies to be incomplete or incorrect.\nWe may be subject to enforcement action or penalties based on our current policy regarding the distribution of 340B program drugs at 340B ceiling prices through third-party pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B program, known as \u201c340B contract pharmacies\u201d. Increasing use of 340B contract pharmacies, coupled with a lack of oversight and transparency, has resulted in increased risks of 340B statutory violations related to the diversion of 340B-purchased drugs to individuals who are not patients of the 340B covered entity, and to prohibited \u201cduplicate discounts\u201d when 340B-purchased drugs are also billed to Medicaid. These program integrity risks have been exacerbated by the exponential growth in the use of 340B contract pharmacies over the past decade. We adopted a new 340B contract pharmacy policy to address these risks by limiting shipments to 340B contract pharmacies that meet certain criteria. Our new contract pharmacy policy is intended to\n2021 Annual Report 39\npreserve patient access, while addressing compliance and integrity concerns resulting from the proliferation of contract pharmacies - problems that overshadow and threaten to undermine this vital safety net program. Nonetheless, certain 340B covered entities and the HHS, in a non-binding (and now-retracted) Advisory Opinion, stated that, in their view, manufacturers in the 340B program are obligated to sell 340B drugs at the 340B ceiling prices to all contract pharmacies acting as agents of a covered entity.\nWe and certain other manufacturers initiated litigation challenging the Advisory Opinion and HRSA\u2019s position on contract pharmacies generally. HRSA subsequently withdrew the Advisory Opinion, but issued letters to manufacturers, including us, threatening enforcement action if the manufacturers do not abandon their 340B contract pharmacy policies. We filed suit against HHS and HRSA on June 23, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On September 22, 2021, HRSA sent to us, along with the other manufacturers challenging HRSA\u2019s 340B interpretation, letters stating that HRSA is referring \u201cthis issue to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG)\u201d for potential enforcement action. We have not had any communication from OIG regarding our 340B contract pharmacy policy. On November 5, 2021, the court granted our motion for summary judgment, ruling that the letters threatening enforcement action \u201ccontain legal reasoning that rests upon an erroneous reading of Section 340B.\u201d HRSA filed a notice of appeal on December 28, 2021, and the appeal is pending. If HRSA prevails on appeal or develops a new theory of liability, we may face enforcement action or penalties as well as adverse publicity. We expect the compliance of policies like ours will continue to be litigated.\nIf we and other manufacturers are unable to curb the proliferation of abuses caused by 340B contract pharmacies, we could see an increased prevalence of sales at reduced 340B ceiling prices, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues.\nPatient assistance programs for pharmaceutical products have come under increasing scrutiny by governments, legislative bodies, and enforcement agencies. These activities may result in actions that effectively reduce prices or demand for our products, harm our business or reputation, or subject us to fines or penalties.\nCompany-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and manufacturers\u2019 donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, are subject to heightened scrutiny. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has taken enforcement action against pharmaceutical companies alleging violations of the Federal False Claims Act and other laws in connection with patient assistance programs. In December 2017, we entered into a civil Settlement Agreement with the U.S. Government to resolve a DOJ investigation of our support of non-profit patient assistance programs and paid $210.0 million, plus interest, to the U.S. Government upon settlement. We also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (the CIA) with the OIG, which requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for five years.\nWe may be required to incur significant future costs to comply with the CIA. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or the CIA, or if our vendors or donation recipients fail to comply with applicable requirements or guidance, we could be subject to penalties including fines, suspension of regulatory approvals that cause us to suspend production, distribution or marketing activities, product recalls, seizure of our products, criminal prosecution, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and burdensome remediation measures. Any of these penalties could adversely affect our operating results, the value of our company and our reputation. Patients and physicians may avoid using our products even after we have resolved the issues that led to adverse regulatory action.\nMembers of Congress have called upon the OIG to issue revised guidance about patient assistance programs. Actions taken by the OIG, the DOJ or other agencies as a result of this industry-wide inquiry could reduce demand for our products and/or coverage of our products by federal and state health care. If any or all of these events occur, our business, prospects, and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nPayers and PBMs have developed mechanisms to limit the benefits of co-pay assistance for commercially insured programs through co-pay accumulator programs. These programs do not allow a patient using co-pay assistance to count the manufacturer\u2019s co-payment contribution toward their annual out-of-pocket payment maximum. Therefore, patients using co-pay assistance are penalized financially for using these programs. Some states have passed legislation to limit the use of co-pay accumulator programs, while some other states have indicated that these programs should be allowed to limit cost of care and encourage patients to use lower cost generics. In addition, some states have imposed restrictions on manufacturer co-pay programs when therapeutic equivalents are available. Growing use of such programs, or new laws limiting manufacturer ability to provide co-pay assistance, could affect patient access to our products and limit product utilization, which may, in turn, adversely affect our business, prospects, and stock price.\nImproper handling of hazardous materials used in our activities could expose us to significant remediation liabilities.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous substances. We are expanding these activities in both scale and location. Patients may dispose of our products using means we do not control. Such activities subject us to numerous federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the management, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs. The risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. Once chemical and hazardous materials leave our facilities, we cannot control the manner in which such hazardous waste is disposed of by our contractors. We could be liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of the release of hazardous materials and such liability could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnited Therapeutics, a public benefit corporation\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate information about our products and the diseases that our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in our industry continue to evolve and regulations related to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance. For example, patients and others may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, we may fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend against political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions, or incur other harm to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Data Privacy\nIf any of the agreements under which we license or acquired intellectual property rights are breached or terminated, we could lose our rights to continue to develop, manufacture, and sell the products covered by such agreements.\nOur business depends upon our continuing ability to exploit our intellectual property rights acquired from third parties under product license and purchase agreements covering drugs or other products or technology. We may be required to license additional intellectual property owned by third parties to continue to develop and commercialize our products. This dependence on intellectual property developed by others involves the following risks:\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain rights to intellectual property that we need for our business at a reasonable cost or at all;\n\u2022If any of our product licenses or purchase agreements are terminated, we may lose our rights to develop, make, and sell the products to which such licenses or agreements relate;\n\u2022Our rights to develop and market products to which the intellectual property relates are frequently limited to specific territories and fields of use (such as treatment of particular diseases); and\n\u2022If a licensor of intellectual property fails to maintain the intellectual property licensed, we may lose any ability to prevent others from developing or marketing similar products covered by such intellectual property. In addition, we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or take legal action seeking to force the licensor to do so.\nOur intellectual property rights may not effectively deter competitors from developing competing products that, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits.\nThe period under which our commercial and developmental therapies are protected by our patent rights is limited. Three of our U.S. patents covering our current methods of synthesizing and producing treprostinil, the active ingredient in Tyvaso, Tyvaso DPI, Remodulin, and Orenitram, expired in October 2017, and three more will expire in 2028. Our patents related to our individual treprostinil-based products expire at various times between 2024 and 2031. We entered into settlement agreements with a number of generic drug companies permitting certain companies to launch generic versions of Remodulin in the United States and other companies to launch generic versions of Orenitram and Tyvaso in the United States. A U.S. patent for Adcirca for treatment of pulmonary hypertension expired in November 2017, and FDA-conferred regulatory exclusivity expired in May 2018, leading to the launch of a generic version of Adcirca in August 2018. We have no issued patents or pending patent applications covering Unituxin. For further details, please see Part I, Item 1.-Business-Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses, and Market Exclusivity-Generic Competition and Challenges to our Intellectual Property Rights.\nWe cannot be sure that our existing or any new patents will effectively deter or delay competitors\u2019 efforts to bring new products to market, or that additional patent applications will result in new patents. When our patents expire, competitors may develop generic versions of our products and market them at a lower price to compete with our products. Competitors may also seek to design around our patents or exclude patented methods of treatment, such as patent-protected indications, from the label for generic versions of our products in an effort to develop competing products that do not infringe our patents. In addition, patent laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the patent laws of the United States.\nThird parties have challenged, and may in the future challenge, the validity of our patents, through patent litigation and/or initiating proceedings, including re-examinations, IPRs, post-grant reviews, and interference proceedings, before the USPTO or other applicable patent filing office, or other means. In March 2020, Liquidia filed IPR petitions for two of our treprostinil-related patents, and in October 2020 the PTAB instituted IPR proceedings with respect to one of these patents and declined to institute proceedings with respect to the other patent. In April 2020, we received a Paragraph IV notification letter from Liquidia indicating that Liquidia\u2019s NDA contains a certification alleging that Yutrepia will not infringe any of the patents currently listed in the Orange Book for Tyvaso because those patents are not valid, not enforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of Yutrepia. In June 2020, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Liquidia related to its NDA for Yutrepia. In January 2021, Liquidia filed an IPR petition for an additional patent that we listed in the Orange Book for Tyvaso and asserted against Liquidia in the pending litigation. We are also engaged in patent litigation with ANI related to its ANDA seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of Orenitram.\n2021 Annual Report 41\nPatent litigation can be time consuming, distracting, and costly, and the outcome may be difficult to predict and unfavorable to us. If we are unsuccessful in the defense of our patents, our business could be negatively impacted. Even if our patents are determined to be valid or enforceable, a competitor could circumvent our patents by effectively designing around the claims of our patents. Accordingly, our patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and other technological advances that we do not publicly disclose. Our confidentiality agreements with our Unitherians and others to whom we disclose trade secrets and confidential information may not necessarily prevent our trade secrets from being used or disclosed without our authorization. These agreements may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to enforce or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. If our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us, and our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nThird parties may allege that our products or services infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights, which could result in the payment of royalties that negatively affect our profits, subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation, or cause us to lose the ability to sell the related products.\nTo the extent third-party patents to which we currently do not hold licenses are necessary for us to manufacture, use, or sell our products, we would need to obtain necessary licenses to prevent infringement. For products or services that utilize intellectual property of strategic collaborators or other suppliers, such suppliers may have an obligation to secure the needed license to these patents at their cost; if not, we would be responsible for the cost of these licenses. Royalty payments and other fees under these licenses would erode our profits from the sale of related products and services. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of the product to avoid infringing a third-party patent, we would be unable to continue to manufacture or sell related products.\nIf a third party commences legal action against us for infringement, we may incur significant costs to defend the action and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our day-to-day business operations, whether or not the action has merit. An adverse judgment or settlement resulting from the action could require us to pay substantial amounts in damages for infringement or to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim, or could result in injunctive relief limiting our ability to develop, manufacture, or sell our products.\nInformation technology security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to legal responsibility which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, much of which is outsourced to third parties including in \u201ccloud\u201d based platforms. We collect, store, and use sensitive or confidential data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, customers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and European Union regulations related to data privacy, which require us to protect the privacy and security of certain types of information. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, or subject to system failures. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Any breaches or failures could compromise sensitive and confidential information stored on our networks or those of third parties and expose such information to public disclosure, loss, or theft. Any actual or alleged unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations, and damage to our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Costs we may incur as a result of any of the foregoing, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Given the increasing use of conferencing technologies to conduct business virtually in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, these cybersecurity risks are becoming more prevalent.\nRisks Related to Our Financing Capacity, Indebtedness, and Investments\nIf we need additional financing and cannot obtain it, our product development and sales efforts may be limited.\nWe may be required to seek additional sources of financing to meet unplanned or planned expenditures. Unplanned expenditures could be significant and may result from necessary modifications to product development plans or product offerings in response to difficulties encountered with clinical trials. We may also face unexpected costs in preparing products for commercial sale, or in maintaining sales levels of our currently marketed therapeutic products. Our Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be compelled to delay clinical studies, curtail operations, or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets.\nUnited Therapeutics, a public benefit corporation\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service or repay our indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may borrow up to $1.5 billion under our Credit Agreement, which matures in December 2025. Currently, our outstanding principal balance is $800.0 million. Our ability to repay or refinance our debt obligations under our Credit Agreement and any future debt that we may incur will depend on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to a number of factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, disposing of material assets or operations, seeking additional debt or equity capital, or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such actions may not enable us to meet any such debt service obligations. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry could be impaired.\nWe may select interest rates under our Credit Agreement that are calculated using LIBOR. The authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR rate used in the Credit Agreement after June 2023. If the relevant LIBOR rate ceases to exist after June 2023, we and Wells Fargo, as the administrative agent, may amend the Credit Agreement to establish an alternate benchmark reference rate. To the extent our interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur portfolio of investments is subject to market, interest, operational, and credit risk that may reduce its value.\nWe maintain a portfolio of investments that includes: (1) corporate debt securities; (2) strategic investments in publicly-traded equity securities; and (3) strategic debt and equity investments in privately-held companies. These investments are subject to general economic conditions, volatility in the financial marketplace, market- and industry-wide dynamics, changes in interest rates, industry- and company-specific developments impacting the business, prospects, and credit ratings of the issuer of the securities, and other factors, each of which has affected, and may in the future affect, the income that we receive from our investments, the net realizable value of our investments, and our ability to sell them. These factors have caused, and could in the future cause, us to: (a) experience a decline in our investment income; (b) record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio; or (c) sell investments for less than our acquisition cost; each of which in turn could negatively impact our liquidity and our earnings. Our efforts to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and monitoring of our portfolio\u2019s overall risk profile may not be successful and the value of our investments may decline. The privately-held companies we have invested in may be particularly susceptible to the factors described above as these companies are typically in the early stages of developing technologies or products that may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment in these companies.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock can be highly volatile and may decline.\nThe price of common stock can be highly volatile within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. Consequently, significant price and volume fluctuations in the market may not relate to operating performance. The price of our common stock could decline sharply due to general market conditions as well as the following factors, among others:\n\u2022Developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic impact, and their effects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\n\u2022Quarterly and annual financial results and any failure to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts;\n\u2022Timing of enrollment and results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022Announcements regarding generic or other challenges to the intellectual property related to our products, the launch of generic versions of our products or other competitive products, and the impact of competition from generic and other products on our revenues;\n\u2022Announcements regarding litigation matters, including the lawsuit filed against us by Sandoz and RareGen and our ongoing patent litigation with Liquidia related to its NDA for Yutrepia, among others;\n\u2022Announcements regarding our efforts to obtain FDA approval of, and to launch, new products, such as Tyvaso DPI;\n\u2022Physician, patient, investor, or public concerns regarding the efficacy and/or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others;\n\u2022Changes in, or new laws and regulations affecting reimbursement of, our therapeutic products by government payers, changes in reimbursement policies of private insurance companies, and negative publicity surrounding the cost of high-priced therapies;\n\u2022Announcements of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products, including in particular the development of new, competing PAH therapies;\n2021 Annual Report 43\n\u2022Substantial sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders, or concerns that such sales may occur;\n\u2022Future issuances of common stock by us or other activity which could be viewed as being dilutive to our shareholders;\n\u2022Rumors or incorrect statements by investors and/or analysts concerning our company, our products, or our operations;\n\u2022Failures or delays in our efforts to obtain or maintain domestic or international regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products, or problems with our manufacturing, regulatory, compliance, promotional, marketing or sales activities that result in regulatory penalties or restrictions on our products, up to the withdrawal of our products from the market; and\n\u2022Accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short-term holdings.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our charter, bylaws and employment and license agreements, among other things, could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that may be beneficial to our public shareholders.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our restated certificate of incorporation, and our ninth amended and restated bylaws may prevent, delay, or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest; the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities; and/or the replacement or removal of current management by our shareholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation previously divided our Board of Directors into three classes. The recent declassification of our Board will be phased in and all directors will not be elected annually until our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. This provision may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace the majority of directors until such time. It may also deter the accumulation of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks. In addition, as a result of our recent conversion to a PBC, our Board is required to consider and balance the financial interests of shareholders, the interests of stakeholders materially affected by our conduct, and the pursuit of our specific public benefit purpose when evaluating takeover offers. This requirement of Delaware PBC law may make our company a less attractive takeover target than a traditional for-profit corporation.\nNon-competition and all other restrictive covenants in most of our employment agreements will terminate upon a change of control that is not approved by our Board. Similarly, a change of control, under certain circumstances, could accelerate the vesting of outstanding stock options, and restricted stock units. Any increase in our stock price resulting from the announcement of a change of control, and our broad-based change of control severance program, under which Unitherians may be entitled to severance benefits if they are terminated without cause (or they terminate their employment for good reason) following a change of control, could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser.\nWe enter into certain license agreements that generally prohibit our counterparties or their affiliates from taking necessary steps to acquire or merge with us, directly or indirectly throughout the term of the agreements, plus a specified period thereafter. We are also party to certain license agreements that restrict our ability to assign or transfer the rights licensed to us to third parties, including parties with whom we wish to merge, or those attempting to acquire us. These agreements often require that we obtain prior consent of the counterparties if we contemplate a change of control. If these counterparties withhold consent, related agreements could be terminated and we would lose related license rights. For example, Lilly and MannKind have the right to terminate our license agreements related to Adcirca and Tyvaso DPI, respectively, in the event of certain change of control transactions. These restrictive change of control provisions could impede or prevent mergers or other transactions that could benefit our shareholders.\nOur shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us.\nWe have never paid, and do not intend to pay, cash dividends. Our Credit Agreement may restrict us from doing so. As a result, the return on an investment in our common stock depends entirely upon the future appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nOur exclusive forum bylaw may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other Unitherians.\nOur bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we agree in writing to an alternative forum, (a) the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if such court does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located in Delaware) will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims, including claims in the right of the corporation based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, Unitherian, or stockholder in such capacity, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, and (b) the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The choice of forum provision may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other Unitherians, and may discourage such lawsuits. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision. If a court ruled the choice of forum provision was inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs to resolve such action in other jurisdictions. Our choice of forum provision is intended to apply to the fullest extent permitted by law to the above-specified types of actions and proceedings, including any derivative actions asserting claims under state law or the federal securities laws. Our shareholders will not be\nUnited Therapeutics, a public benefit corporation\ndeemed, by operation of the choice of forum provision, to have waived our obligation to comply with all applicable federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nIn September 2021, we converted to a Delaware PBC. Conversion may not result in the benefits that we anticipate, requires our directors to balance the interest of shareholders with other interests, and may subject us to additional litigation and other risks.\nOn September 30, 2021, our shareholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to become a PBC, and we completed the conversion to a PBC that same day. While our Board believes that our conversion to a PBC is in the best interest of shareholders, our status as a PBC may not result in the benefits that we anticipate. For example, we may not be able to achieve our public benefit purpose or realize the expected positive impact from being a PBC.\nOne of the primary distinctions between a PBC and a traditional Delaware for-profit corporation is that, in making decisions, the directors of a PBC have an obligation to balance the financial interests of shareholders, the interests of stakeholders materially affected by the PBC\u2019s conduct, and the pursuit of the corporation\u2019s specific public benefit purpose. The application of this balancing obligation may allow our directors to make decisions that they could not have made pursuant to the fiduciary duties applicable prior to PBC conversion. There is no guarantee that our Board will resolve conflicts among the financial interests of our shareholders, our specific public benefit purpose, or stakeholders materially affected by our conduct, in favor of our shareholders\u2019 financial interests. For instance, in a sale of control transaction, our Board would be required to consider and balance the factors listed above and might choose to accept an offer that does not maximize short-term shareholder value due to its consideration of other factors. This requirement of Delaware PBC law may make our company a less attractive takeover target than a traditional for-profit corporation.\nA Delaware PBC must also provide its shareholders with a statement, at least every other year, as to the PBC\u2019s assessment of the success of its efforts to promote its public benefit purpose and the best interests of those materially affected by the PBC's conduct. If the public perceives that we are not successful in promoting our public benefit purpose, or that our pursuit of our public benefit purpose is having a negative effect on the financial interests of our shareholders, that perception could negatively affect our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price. In addition, Delaware's PBC statute may be amended to require more explicit or burdensome reporting requirements that could increase the time and expense required to comply.\nAs a Delaware PBC, we may be subject to increased litigation risk.\nShareholders of a Delaware PBC (if they, individually or collectively, own the lesser of (1) two percent of the PBC\u2019s outstanding shares; or (2) shares with a market value of $2 million or more on the date the lawsuit is instituted) can file a derivative lawsuit claiming the directors failed to balance shareholder and public benefit interests. Traditional Delaware for-profit corporations are not subject to this potential liability. As a PBC, we may be subject to increased derivative litigation, which may be costly and require management\u2019s attention, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is currently limited case law involving PBCs (including case law interpreting and applying the balancing obligation of PBC directors), which may expose us to additional litigation risk generally until additional case law develops or additional legislative action is taken.", "PERMNO": 87006, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "UTHR"}
