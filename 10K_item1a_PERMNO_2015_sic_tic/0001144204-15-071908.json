You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on Form 10-K, with respect to any investment in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this report (unless another date is indicated) and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future development.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are substantially dependent upon the success and market acceptance of our technology. The failure of the emissions monitoring and controls market to develop as we anticipate, would adversely affect our environmental control products business.\nThe Company's success is largely dependent on increased market acceptance of our emission monitoring equipment and control systems. If acceptance of emissions monitoring equipment does not continue to grow, then the Company's revenues may be significantly reduced.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to its continued operations.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain or renew its credit agreements and other finance agreements in the future. In the event the business grows rapidly, the uncertain economic climate continues or the Company considers another acquisition, additional financing resources could be necessary in the current or future fiscal years. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, or at all in the future.\nAdverse changes in the economy or political conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for its customers\u2019 products. The uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environment could result in a decline in demand for our customers\u2019 products in any industry. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws affecting our customers could result in decreasing gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMost of the Company\u2019s customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and to manage inventory levels.\nThe volume and timing of sales to the Company\u2019s customers may vary due to:\n(i) customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory\n(ii) variation in demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products design changes, or\n(iii) acquisitions of or consolidation among customers\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers do not commit to firm production schedules. The Company\u2019s inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels. The Company could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers. Orders from the Company\u2019s customers could be cancelled or delivery schedules could be deferred as a result of changes in its customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations, and resulting in higher inventory levels.\nCemtrex, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nThe Company\u2019s customers have competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, pricing pressure and decreasing demand from their customers, which could adversely affect their business and the Company\u2019s.\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our customers and the Company. These factors include:\n(i) increased competition among our customers and their competitors\n(ii) the inability of our customers to develop and market their products\n(iii) recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets\n(iv) the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete\n(v) our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology\n(vi) pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop new products, our competitors may develop and market products with better features that may reduce demand for our potential products.\nThe Company may not be able to introduce any new products or any enhancements to its existing products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, the introduction by the Company of any new products could adversely affect the sales of certain of its existing products. If the Company's competitors develop innovative emissions testing technology that are superior to the Company's products or if the Company fails to accurately anticipate market trends and respond on a timely basis with its own innovations, the Company may not achieve sufficient growth in its revenues to attain profitability.\nEven though we have a profit for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and we may not incur profit for the foreseeable future.\nWe continue to incur significant expenditures related to selling and marketing and general and administrative activities as well as capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses may increase in the foreseeable future as we expand our business. Further, as a public company we will also incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we may not incur as a private company. To maintain profitability, we will need to generate significant additional revenues with significantly improved gross margins. It is uncertain whether we will be able to maintain our profitability.\nThe Company faces constant changes in governmental standards by which our environmental control products are evaluated.\nThe Company believes that, due to the constant focus on the environment and clean air standards throughout the world, a requirement in the future to adhere to new and more stringent regulations both domestically and abroad is possible as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air. In the event our products fail to meet these ever-changing standards, some or all of our environmental control products may become obsolete.\nThe future growth of our environmental control business depends, in part, on enforcement of existing emissions-related environmental regulations and further tightening of emission standards worldwide.\nThe Company expects that the future environmental control products business growth will be driven, in part, by the enforcement of existing emissions-related environmental regulations and tightening of emissions standards worldwide. If such standards do not continue to become stricter or are loosened or are not enforced by governmental authorities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.\nCemtrex, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing our proprietary information, defending against third-party patents, invalidating third-party patents or licensing third-party intellectual property, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nThe Company considers its technology and procedures proprietary. In particular, the Company depends substantially on its flexibility to develop custom engineered solutions for various applications and be responsive to customer needs.\nThe Company may be notified of claims that it has infringed a third party's intellectual property. Even if such claims are not valid, they could subject the Company to significant costs. In addition, it may be necessary in the future to enforce the Company's intellectual property rights to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could force the Company to take actions that could harm its business. These include: (i) ceasing to sell products that contain allegedly infringing property; (ii) obtaining licenses to the relevant intellectual property which the Company may not be able to obtain on terms that are acceptable, or at all; (iii) indemnifying certain customers or strategic partners if it is determined that the Company has infringed upon or misappropriated another party's intellectual property; and (iv) redesigning products that embody allegedly infringing intellectual property. Any of these results could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of defending or asserting any intellectual property claim, both in legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant.\nProduct defects could cause the Company to incur significant product liability, warranty, repair and support costs and damage its reputation which would have a material adverse effect on its business.\nAlthough the Company rigorously tests its products, defects may be discovered in future or existing products. These defects could cause the Company to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs and divert the attention of its research and development personnel. It could also significantly damage the Company's reputation and relationship with its distributors and customers which would adversely affect its business. In addition, such defects could result in personal injury or financial or other damages to customers who may seek damages with respect to such losses. A product liability claim against the Company, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nThere is significant competition among companies that provide emissions monitoring systems. Several companies market products that compete directly with our products. Other companies offer products that potential customers may consider to be acceptable alternatives to our products and services. We face direct competition from companies with far greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources.\nThe Company's results may fluctuate due to certain regulatory, marketing and competitive factors over which we have little or no control.\nThe factors listed below, some of which we cannot control, may cause our revenue and results of operations to fluctuate significantly:\n(i) The existence and enforcement of government environmental regulations. If these regulations are not maintained or enforced then the market for Company's products could deteriorate;\n(ii) Retaining and keeping qualified employees and management personnel;\n(iii) Ability to upgrade our products to keep up with the changing market place requirements; Ability to keep up with our competitors who have much higher resources than us;\n(iv) Ability to find sub-suppliers and sub-contractors to assemble and install our products;\nCemtrex, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n(v) General economic conditions of the industry and the ability of potential customers to spend money on setting up new industries that require our products;\n(vi) Ability to maintain or raise adequate working capital required for the operations and future growth; and\n(vii) Ability to retain our CEO and other senior key personnel.\nThe loss of our senior management and failure to attract and retain qualified personnel in a competitive labor market could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy, resulting a slower rate of growth.\nWe depend on the continued service of our senior management. Due to the nature of our business, we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel and retaining such personnel once hired. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy resulting in a slower rate of growth.\nGeneral economic downturns in general would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company's operations may in the future experience substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of general economic conditions affecting consumer spending. Therefore, any economic downturns in general would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. A significant portion of our business is conducted internationally. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n(i) compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n(ii) compliance with the anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate;\n(iii) contract award and funding delays;\n(iv) potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n(v) foreign currency fluctuations;\n(vi) import and export duties and value added taxes;\n(vii) uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n(viii) potential military conflicts, civil strife and political risks.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions of other businesses, which may require us to incur costs and liabilities or have other unexpected consequences which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition to internal or organic growth, our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses, as well as growth from acquisitions that would diversify our current product offerings. Like other companies with similar growth strategies, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, as we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain acceptable financing, or consummate any future acquisitions. We frequently engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions, certain of which, if consummated, could significantly enhance the Company\u2019s competitive position. Although it is our general objective only to acquire those companies which will be accretive to both earnings and cash flow, any potential acquisitions may result in material transaction expenses, increased interest and amortization expense, increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Acquisitions will require integration and management of the acquired businesses to realize economies of scale and control costs. In addition, acquisitions may involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets. Future acquisitions may also result in potential dilution of the Company\u2019s securities. Consummation of acquisitions may subject the Company to unanticipated business uncertainties or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not fully indemnify us.\nCemtrex, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY\nThe Company's Common Stock currently trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \"CETX\". There can be no assurance that the Company's shares will continue to trade on NASDAQ in the future, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be sustained. The market price of the shares of Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company's operating results, announcements of technological innovations, new products or new contracts by the Company or its competitors, developments with respect to proprietary rights, adoption of new government regulations affecting the environment, general market conditions and other factors. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stocks of technology companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nOur common stock has from time to time been \"thinly-traded,\" meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Therefore, stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares. Our \u201cthinly-traded\u201d stock is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give stockholders any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends. No dividends have been paid on the common stock of the Company. The Company does not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future, and anticipates that profits, if any, received from operations will be devoted to the Company's future operations. Any decision to pay dividends will depend upon the Company's profitability at the time, cash available and other relevant factors.\nOur principal shareholder has significant influence over our Company which could make it impossible for the public stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company. Approximately 65.0% of our outstanding voting equity is beneficially held by combination of Aron Govil, the Company's former Chairman of the Board, and Saagar Govil the Company\u2019s CEO, as a result of this common stock ownership and the Series A preferred stock ownership by Mr. Aron Govil, the Company\u2019s management controls and will control in the future, substantially all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the Company, including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This makes it impossible for the public stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.", "PERMNO": 15417, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "CETX"}
