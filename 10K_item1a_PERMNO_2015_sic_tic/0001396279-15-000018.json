{"cik": "1396279", "company": "hhgregg, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nDescribed below are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. The following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf related to conditions or events we anticipate may occur in the future. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks below.\nOur success depends upon our effective execution of our strategies.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively identify, develop and execute our strategies. In the upcoming year we intend to execute on key initiatives to reduce expenses and stabilize revenue as described in Item 7 \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview.\u201d During fiscal 2016, our initiatives are aimed at returning the Company to profitable growth, and positioning the Company for long-term growth. However, it may take longer than expected to achieve our objectives, and actual results may be materially less than planned. Our ability to improve our operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ncustomer response to our marketing and merchandise strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources to better position our business to drive additional traffic and increase sales in our comparable store base;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and increase net sales in both new and existing product categories;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide customers with highly trained and consultative sales associates, best-in-class delivery and installation services and compelling financing offers;\n\u2022\nour ability to respond to competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage inventory;\n\u2022\nthe success of our omnichannel strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to benefit from capital improvements made to our store environment;\n\u2022\nour ability to access adequate and uninterrupted supply of merchandise from suppliers at expected levels and on acceptable terms; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nFailure to execute these initiatives and strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and maintain positive brand perception and recognition or if there is a lack of new product introductions and innovation, our net sales and profitability may decline.\nOur products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our ability to maintain and increase net sales depends to a large extent on the periodic introduction and availability of new products and technologies. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in consumer preferences relating to major household appliances and consumer electronics such as high efficiency appliances and ultra high definition televisions. It is possible that new products will never achieve widespread consumer acceptance. Our margins are enhanced due to our ability to sell more feature-rich products with higher margins early in the product life cycle, thus a lack of new products in the market would impair our ability to maintain gross margins as a percentage of sales. Significant deviations from the anticipated consumer preferences for the products we sell could result in lost net sales and lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory. If we are unable to effectively introduce and sell new products to our customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that a focus on customer service fosters the development of our brand recognition and reputation. If we are unable to maintain our high level of customer service, our brand recognition, reputation, business and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected. Additionally, the increasing usage of web-based social media means that consumer feedback and other information about our Company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. The impact of such feedback could negatively affect our brand perception and recognition, and as a result could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee retention and productivity, vendor relationship issues and other factors, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have many competitors, direct and indirect. If we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing and distribution strategies effectively, those competitors could take sales and market share from us.\nThe retail market for major home appliances, consumer electronics and home furniture is intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of national retailers, including Best Buy, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Sam\u2019s Club, Sears, Target and Wal-Mart, internet retailers, regional or independent specialty retail stores and mass merchandisers that sell many of the same or similar major home appliances, consumer electronics and home furniture that we do. There are few barriers to entry and as a result new competitors may enter our existing or new markets at any time.\nPrice is of primary importance to customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices to attract customers.We may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors. Some of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be able to purchase inventory at lower prices. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and may have greater resources to devote to discounts, promotions and sales of products and services. They may also have financial resources that enable them to weather economic downturns better than us. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including:\n\u2022\nlower pricing;\n\u2022\nmore aggressive advertising and marketing;\n\u2022\nenhanced product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nextension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we make available;\n\u2022\ninnovative store formats, including store within a store;\n\u2022\nimproved retail sales methods;\n\u2022\nenhanced customer service experiences;\n\u2022\nonline product offerings; and\n\u2022\nexpansion into markets where we currently operate.\nCompetition could cause us to lose market share, net sales and customers, which could negatively impact our comparable store sales, increase expenditures or reduce prices or margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to hire, train and retain key management, qualified managers, sales associates and other employees, we could have difficulty implementing our business strategy, which may result in reduced net sales, operating margins and profitability.\nOur performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. A key element of our competitive strategy is to provide product expertise to our customers through our extensively trained, commissioned sales associates, which, we believe, results in more of our customers purchasing higher-margin, feature-rich products. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed in the future, including qualified sales personnel and candidates for our MIT program, our level of customer service may decline, which may decrease our net sales and profitability. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s reputation, employee morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees. Our ability to control labor costs, which may impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations. If our labor and/or benefit costs increase, we may not be able to hire or maintain qualified personnel to the extent necessary to execute our competitive strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of senior management employees with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations.\nIf we do not maintain the security of customer, associate, or Company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.\nThe use and handling of personally identifiable data by us, our employees, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from consumer fraud, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate customer and other confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse affect on our reputation and may expose us to material costs, penalties, compensation claims, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.\nFailure to effectively achieve our cost cutting initiatives could have a material adverse affect on our profitability.\nAs part of our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs, we have implemented numerous cost cutting initiatives. We plan to continue to implement additional cost cutting initiatives in fiscal 2016 and beyond. If we are unable to achieve, or have any unexpected delays in achieving, the anticipated cost savings and benefits associated with these initiatives, our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. The negative impact of consumer spending on our sales results makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, other store expenses or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to increase sales and store productivity is largely dependent upon our ability to increase customer traffic and conversion.\nCustomer traffic depends upon our ability to successfully market compelling merchandise assortments as well as present an appealing shopping environment and experience to customers. Our traditional marketing model depended on direct mail, which has been declining in effectiveness, and as a result our marketing strategy has struggled as our target customers have shifted away from responding to direct mail. As a part of our strategic initiatives, we are testing a variety of marketing media mix campaigns within several markets in an effort to deliver sustainable profits. Our marketing strategy may fail to reach the intended market and may not be successful in generating incremental customer traffic or increasing conversion rates. This could result in a continued or accelerated reduction in customer traffic and conversion. Any such outcome, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may adversely affect our operating results. In addition, external events outside of our control, including pandemics, terrorist threats, domestic conflicts and civil unrest, may influence customers' decisions to visit stores or might otherwise cause customers to avoid public places. There is no assurance that we will be able to reverse any decline in traffic or that increases in Internet sales will offset any decline in store traffic. We may need to respond to any declines in customer traffic or conversion rates by increasing markdowns or promotions to attract customers, which could adversely impact our gross margins, operating results and cash flows from operating activities.\nRegulatory and other developments could impact our credit card financing offers available to customers and have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nWe offer private-label credit cards through third-party financial institutions that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Cardholders who choose the private-label card can receive low- or no-interest promotional financing on qualifying purchases. If a customer utilizes a deferred interest financing offer and fails to comply with the terms of the offer, all deferred interest becomes due and payable to the third-party financial institution. Additionally, we offer secondary financing for lower-\nmiddle income customers that do not qualify for the private-label credit card and \u201clease to own\u201d financing, both of which are through third-party providers and non-recourse to our business. Over the past 12 months, we have continued to improve the penetration rate of our non-recourse credit offerings, including our private-label credit card, secondary and \u201clease to own\u201d finance offerings, by approximately 360 basis points to 41%.\nRecently enacted legislative and regulatory changes that focus on a variety of credit related matters have had no material adverse impact on our operations to date. However, if future legislative or regulatory restrictions or prohibitions arise that affect our ability to offer promotional financing and we are unable to adjust our operations in a timely manner, our net sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as the economic and regulatory environment in the banking industry continues to change, banks continue to re-evaluate their strategies, practices and terms, including, but not limited to, the levels at which consumer credit is granted and the strategic focus on various business segments, such as the private-label retail partner card business. If any of our credit card programs ended prematurely, the terms and provisions, or interpretations thereof, were substantially modified, or approval rates or types of financing offered to our customers amended, promotional financing volumes and our net sales and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could incur additional charges due to impairment of long-lived assets.\nAt March 31, 2015, we had long-lived asset balances of $128.1 million, which are subject to periodic testing for impairment. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we have recorded impairment charges of $47.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. A significant amount of judgment is involved in the periodic testing. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow generated from operations at individual store locations could result in additional impairment charges for the related fixed assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. Impairment charges, if any, resulting from the periodic testing are non-cash.\nAny failure of our information technology infrastructure or management information systems could cause a disruption in our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur ability to operate our business from day to day largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology infrastructure and management information systems. We use our management information systems to conduct our operations and for critical corporate and business planning functions, including store operations, sales management, merchandising, marketing, supply chain and inventory management, financial reporting and accounting, delivery and other customer services and various administrative functions. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. Operating legacy systems subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading and replacing these systems and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel to maintain and operate the systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs. Any failure that is not covered by our disaster recovery plan could cause an interruption in our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels or other technical difficulties, could cause us to forgo material revenues and adversely affect our reputation with consumers.\nAs customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multi-channel sales and marketing strategy, the failure to utilize, manage and maintain those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.\nAccess to the internet from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them. Our website, hhgregg.com, is a sales channel for our products, and is also a method of making product information available to them that impacts our in-store sales. In addition to hhgregg.com, we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inform, cross-sell and otherwise interact with our customers. Our website is a significant component of our advertising strategy. We believe our website represents a possible source for future sales. In order to promote our products and services, allow our customers to complete credit applications in the privacy of their homes and drive traffic to our stores, we must effectively create, design, publish and distribute content over the internet. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design and publish web content with a high level of effectiveness or grow our e-commerce business in a profitable manner. Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our business and negatively affect our customers\u2019 perceptions of hhgregg as a reliable online vendor and source of information about appliances, consumer electronics, furniture and other home products and services, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf our third-party delivery services are unable to meet our promised delivery schedule, our net sales may decline due to a decline in customer satisfaction.\nWe offer delivery capabilities on many of the products we sell. Our deliveries are outsourced to third-party delivery providers. Our third-party delivery services are subject to risks that are beyond our control. If our products are not delivered to our customers on time, our customers may cancel their orders or we may lose business from these customers in the future. As a result, our net sales and profitability may decline.\nOur comparable store sales may not be an indication of our future results of operations because they fluctuate\nsignificantly.\nOur historical comparable store sales figures have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable store sales results, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, such as pricing pressure and the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nNew product introductions;\n\u2022\nConsumer trends;\n\u2022\nChanges in our marketing programs;\n\u2022\nChanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\nChanges in the relative sales price points of our major product categories;\n\u2022\nOur ability to offer attractive credit programs to our customers;\n\u2022\nWeather conditions in our markets;\n\u2022\nTiming of promotional events;\n\u2022\nReduction in new store openings;\n\u2022\nThe percentage of our stores that are mature stores;\n\u2022\nThe locations of our stores and the traffic drawn to those areas;\n\u2022\nHow often we update our stores; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to execute our business strategies effectively.\nChanges in our quarterly and annual comparable store sales results could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur business is dependent on the general economic conditions in our markets.\nIn general, our sales depend on discretionary spending by our customers. General economic factors and other conditions that may affect our business include periods of slow economic growth or recession, political factors including uncertainty in social or fiscal policy, an overly anti-business climate or sentiment, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to us and our customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income, sustained high rates of unemployment, high consumer debt levels, increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters and acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism. Additionally, any of these circumstances concentrated in the region of the U.S. in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. General economic conditions and discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence in the economy;\n\u2022\nunemployment trends;\n\u2022\nconsumer debt levels;\n\u2022\nconsumer credit availability;\n\u2022\nthe housing and home improvement markets;\n\u2022\ngasoline and fuel prices;\n\u2022\ninterest rates and inflation;\n\u2022\nslower rates of growth in real disposable personal income;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nnational and international geopolitical concerns;\n\u2022\ntax rates and tax policy; and\n\u2022\nother matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.\nVolatility in financial markets may cause some of the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude. The above factors could result in slowdown in the economy or an uncertain economic outlook, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOther conditions that may impact our results of operations include disruptions in the availability of content such as sporting events or other televised content. Such disruptions may influence the demand for hardware that our customers purchase to access such content, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations and growth.\nOur business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities and to fund our growth. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share. We borrow on occasion to finance our activities, and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms we needed, it could also adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is traded publicly and various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own independent opinions and can be different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nA disruption in our relationships with, or in the operations of, any of our key suppliers could cause our net sales and profitability to decline.\nThe success of our business and our growth strategy depends to a significant degree on our relationships with our suppliers. Our largest suppliers include Curtis, Frigidaire, GE, Haier, LG, Samsung, Seiki, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and Whirlpool. We do not have long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with our major suppliers. We typically order our inventory through the issuance of individual purchase orders to vendors. We have no contractual assurance of the continued supply of merchandise in the amount and assortment we currently offer our customers and we may be subject to rationing by suppliers. In addition, we rely heavily on a relatively small number of suppliers. Our top 10 and 20 suppliers represented 83.7% and 92.1%, respectively, of our purchases in fiscal 2015. The loss of any one or more of our key suppliers or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with these and other suppliers could materially adversely affect our supply and assortment of products, as we may not be able to find suitable replacements to supply products at competitive prices.\nOur suppliers also provide us with marketing funds and volume rebates. If our suppliers fail to continue these incentives, it could have a material adverse affect on our net sales and results of operations.\nIf products that we purchase from vendors are damaged or prove to be defective, we may not be able to return products to these vendors and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain other indemnification from them. Our vendors\u2019 limited capacities may result in a vendor\u2019s inability to replace any defective merchandise in a timely manner. In addition, our vendors\u2019 limited capitalization or liquidity may mean that a vendor that has supplied defective merchandise will not be able to refund the purchase price to us or pay us any penalties or damages associated with any defects, which could have a material adverse affect on our net sales and results of operations.\nThe financial condition of our suppliers may also adversely affect their access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels and product quality and to operate their businesses, all of which could adversely affect our supply chain. Negative impacts on the financial condition of any of our suppliers may cause suppliers to reduce their offerings of customer incentives and vendor allowances, cooperative marketing expenditures and product promotions. It may also cause them to change their pricing policies, which could impact demand for their products. The current weakness in, and volatility of, the overall economy makes it difficult for us and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to carry too much or too little merchandise in various product categories.\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.\nAny disruption in the operation of our distribution centers could result in our inability to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, higher costs, inability to stock our stores or longer lead time associated with distributing merchandise. Any such disruption within our supply chain network, including damage or destruction to one of our five regional distribution centers, could result in decreased net sales, increased costs and reduced profits.\nMany of our suppliers ship merchandise by ocean. Disruptions in the operations of ports through which we import our merchandise, including but not limited to labor disputes involving work slowdowns, lockouts or strikes, could require us and/or our vendors to ship merchandise by air freight or to alternative ports in the United States. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean, which could adversely affect our profitability. Similarly, shipping to alternative ports in the United States could result in increased lead times and transportation costs. Disruptions at ports through which we import our goods could also result in unanticipated inventory shortages, which could adversely impact our reputation and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur statutory, regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:\n\u2022\nThe difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, state and national jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nThe impact of proposed, new or changing statues and regulations, including, but not limited to, corporate governance matters, environmental, financial reform, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, health care reform, labor reform, Payment Card Industry compliance and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;\n\u2022\nThe impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards;\n\u2022\nThe impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and stockholders, and labor and employment matters; and\n\u2022\nChanges in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, economic or political instability, natural disasters, public health emergencies and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages of these items, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods, or may force us to increase prices, thereby adversely impacting net sales and profitability.\nAdapting to regulatory changes and defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders affiliated with our directors own a large percentage of our voting common stock and could limit the influence of our other stockholders on corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors, current holders of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 54.0% of our outstanding common stock. Should some of these stockholders act together, they would be able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including mergers, sales of assets, the election of directors or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders, and they may act in a manner with which our other stockholders may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings. These proceedings may be affected by changes in laws and government regulations or changes in the enforcement thereof.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking action which, in either case, could adversely affect our operations or reduce our net income. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters.\nWe have anti-takeover defense provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may deter potential acquirers and depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and determine the powers, preferences and privileges of those shares without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimit the calling of special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nimpose a requirement that an affirmative vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to amend certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nBecause of these various provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, a takeover attempt or third-party acquisition of us, including a takeover attempt that may result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock, could be delayed, deterred or prevented. In addition, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from increasing in response to actual or rumored takeover attempts and may also prevent changes in our management. As a result, these anti-takeover and change of control provisions may limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92177, "SIC": 5731, "TIC": "HGGGQ"}
