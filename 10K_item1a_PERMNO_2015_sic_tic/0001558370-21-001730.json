{"cik": "1322505", "company": "ALBIREO PHARMA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk Factor Summary\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the material\nfactors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\n\u25cf We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\n\u25cf We depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate, odevixibat, which we are developing initially for the treatment of patients with PFIC and potentially also for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. If we are unable to commercialize odevixibat or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\u25cf If clinical trials of odevixibat or any of our other product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or the EMA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results satisfactory to the FDA or EMA, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of the applicable product candidate.\n\u25cf Favorable results seen to date in clinical trials of odevixibat, including our Phase 3 trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC, may not be predictive of favorable results in our ongoing BOLD pivotal trial of odevixibat in biliary atresia or our ongoing ASSERT pivotal trial of odevixibat in ALGS.\n\u25cf The clinical trial designs, durations, endpoints and outcomes that will be required to obtain marketing approval of odevixibat to treat PFIC patients are uncertain and, in any case, may vary among the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities outside of the United States and Europe. Based on feedback that we have received from the FDA and the EMA, we expect both regulatory authorities to place a greater emphasis on the totality of the data from our Phase 3 clinical trial, including secondary endpoints, than may generally be expected. As a result, there is risk that, even though the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat for FDA evaluation purposes and the primary endpoint for EMA evaluation purposes were both met with statistical significance, the applicable regulatory authority may not find the overall results of our Phase 3 trial to be sufficient to support marketing approval of odevixibat to treat PFIC, a symptom of PFIC such as pruritus or any other indication, and we may never receive marketing approval.\n\u25cf We cannot be assured that either the FDA or EMA will complete their respective reviews of our submissions for approval of odevixibat within the target timelines, including the FDA\u2019s Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of July 20, 2021, as a potential result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\n\u25cf The design of our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC does not conform precisely in all respects to the recommendations or preferences expressed by either the FDA or EMA.\n\u25cf If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our pivotal clinical trials of odevixibat in patients with biliary atresia and ALGS, our receipt of marketing approval for odevixibat in those indications could be delayed or prevented.\n\u25cf If the commercial opportunity in PFIC is smaller than we anticipate, or if odevixibat receives approval to treat only a specific subpopulation of patients with PFIC or only a specific symptom of PFIC such as pruritus, our future revenue from odevixibat may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\n\u25cf If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell odevixibat or any of our other current or potential future product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing the applicable product candidate if it receives marketing approval.\n\u25cf We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products to treat our target indications or markets before or more successfully than we do.\n\u25cf Use of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\n\u25cf If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Even if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\n\u25cf The outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials and the commercialization of any approved product.\nThe terms of our loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. require us to meet certain operating covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was approximately $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We had an accumulated deficit of $266.8 million as of December 31, 2020. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through issuances of shares of common stock, preference shares or convertible loan notes, upfront fees paid upon entering into or amending license agreements, payments received upon the achievement of specified milestone events under the license agreements, grants, venture debt borrowings, and the HCR royalty monetization transactions.. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. We have not completed the development of any drugs, although our licensee, EA Pharma has received approval in Japan of our product candidate elobixibat to treat chronic constipation. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next few years as we continue our development of, and seek marketing approvals for, our product candidates, prepare for and begin the commercialization of any approved products, and add infrastructure and personnel to support our product development efforts and operations as a public company in the United States. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur ability to generate profits from operations and thereafter to remain profitable depends heavily on:\n\u25cf any unfavorable development or delay in our odevixibat program in PFIC, including the review or approval of our odevixibat marketing applications we submitted in the fourth quarter of 2020 in the United States and Europe for PFIC and the costs and timing of our pre-commercialization preparations;\n\u25cf the costs, design, duration and any potential delays of the pivotal clinical trial of odevixibat in biliary atresia and pivotal trial of odevixibat in ALGS;\n\u25cf the scope, number, progress, initiation, duration, cost, results and timing of clinical trials and nonclinical studies of our current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf whether and to what extent milestone events are achieved under our license agreement with EA Pharma or any potential future licensee or collaborator;\n\u25cf the outcomes and timing of regulatory reviews, approvals or other actions;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements on favorable terms and whether and to what extent we retain development or commercialization responsibilities under any new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement;\n\u25cf the success of any other business, product or technology that we acquire or in which we invest;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf our ability to manufacture any approved products on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf our ability to establish a sales and marketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product;\n\u25cf the number and characteristics of product candidates and programs that we pursue.\n\u25cf the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\n\u25cf the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;\n\u25cf our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;\n\u25cf the costs to operate as a public company in the United States, including the need to implement additional financial and reporting systems and other internal systems and infrastructure for our business;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our product candidates, to the extent any are approved for commercial sale; and\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nBased on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we or a potential future licensee or collaborator obtains marketing approval for, and commercializes, one or more of our current or potential future product candidates (other than elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation in Japan), which we do not expect to occur until at least the second half of 2021, if at all. Neither we nor a licensee may ever succeed in obtaining marketing approval for, or commercializing, our product candidates besides elobixibat as a\ntreatment for chronic constipation in Japan and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations and remain profitable would decrease our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in future periods, particularly as we advance the development of our lead product candidate odevixibat beyond its development as a treatment for patients with PFIC into other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, such as our development of odevixibat as a treatment for biliary atresia and as a treatment for ALGS. In addition, we expect that our research and development expenses would increase if we initiate additional preclinical programs for potential future product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates that are not then subject to licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements with third parties, we expect to continue to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company in the United States. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf whether the FDA and the EMA determines that our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat in PFIC is or is not sufficient for regulatory approval to treat PFIC, a symptom of PFIC, a specific PFIC subtype(s) or otherwise;\n\u25cf our ability to establish a sales and marketing organization for the potential commercialization of odevixibat in patients with PFIC, or a sales and marketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any other product candidate, if approved;\n\u25cf the costs, design, duration and any potential delays of the pivotal trial of odevixibat in biliary atresia or the pivotal trial of odevixibat in ALGS;\n\u25cf the same factors that our ability to generate profits from operations and thereafter to remain profitable depend heavily on, as described above under \u201c- We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\u201d;\n\u25cf the scope, number, progress, duration, cost, results and timing of clinical trials and nonclinical studies of our current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf the outcomes and timing of regulatory reviews, approvals or other actions;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain additional licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements on favorable terms and whether and to what extent we retain development or commercialization responsibilities under any new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement;\n\u25cf the success of any other business, product or technology that we acquire or in which we invest;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf our ability to manufacture any approved products on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf the number and characteristics of product candidates and programs that we pursue;\n\u25cf the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;\n\u25cf our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;\n\u25cf the costs to operate as a public company in the United States, including the need to implement additional financial and reporting systems and other internal systems and infrastructure for our business;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our product candidates, to the extent any are approved for commercial sale; and\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that will not be commercially available for sale by us until at least the second half of 2021, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The unavailability of additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, would have an adverse effect on your investment.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our investors, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, grants and debt financings. We do not have any committed external source of funds. On May 7, 2020, we filed a universal shelf registration on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective on May 18, 2020, pursuant to which we registered for sale up to $200 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, including up to $50 million of our common stock available for issuance pursuant to an at-the-market offering program sales agreement that we entered into with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, in May 2020. The agreement was terminated on September 9, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $40.0 million of securities remain available for issuance under the shelf registration statement. We refer to this registration statement as the 2020 Form S-3. On or about February 25, 2021, we expect to file a new universal shelf registration on Form S-3 with the SEC, pursuant to which we expect to register for sale up to $400 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine, which we refer to as the 2021 Form S-3. On or about February 25, 2021, we intend to enter into a new sales agreement, which we refer to as the 2021 Sales Agreement, with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million. Our issuance and sale, if any, of shares under the 2021 Sales Agreement that we intend to enter into are subject to the effectiveness of the 2021 Form S-3. We make no assurances as to if or when the 2021 Form S-3 will become effective or, if it does become effective, as to the continued effectiveness of the 2021 Form S-3. No additional securities registered under the 2020 Form S-3 will be offered or sold after the date of effectiveness of the 2021 Form S-3. This report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any shares under the 2021 Sales Agreement that we intend to enter into or any securities under the 2021 Form S-3 that we intend to file with the SEC, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital at any time. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends or other distributions.\nIf we raise additional funds through licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research and development programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, or a work slowdown or stoppage at those agencies as part of a broader federal government shutdown, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, funding of government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown recurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nThe continuing outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to countries across the world, including the United States. In response to the spread of COVID-19, we have closed our executive offices with our administrative employees continuing their work outside of our offices, restricted on-site staff to only those required to execute their job responsibilities and limited the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, or similar pandemics, we have and may in the future experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf delays or disruptions in preclinical studies or clinical trials due to unforeseen circumstances at contract research organizations and vendors along their supply chain;\n\u25cf increased rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19, being forced to quarantine, or not being willing to travel to clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u25cf interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, which may impact approval timelines, as described further below under \u201cRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates - Our pending NDA seeking approval to market odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC may be delayed as a result of ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions and safety protocols that could affect FDA\u2019s ability to conduct a pre-approval inspection of the drug product\u2019s manufacturing facility, or as a result of operational delays at the FDA or the EMA due to a redeployment of staff or other resources as part of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\u25cf interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems; and\n\u25cf limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, continued reliance on working from home or mass transit disruptions.\nThese and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen in countries that are already afflicted with COVID-19, could continue to spread to additional countries, or could return to countries where the pandemic has been partially contained, each of which could further adversely impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results.\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common stock and the securities of other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock or such sales may be on unfavorable terms. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak may impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nThe terms of our loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital require us to meet certain operating covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOn June 8, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc., in its capacity as administrative and collateral agent for itself and the other Lenders party to the Loan Agreement. The loan advanced under the Loan Agreement, or the Term Loan, is secured by a security interest covering our assets, other than our intellectual property and other customary collateral exclusions. The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and comply with all applicable laws, deliver certain financial reports,\nmaintain a minimum cash balance, and maintain insurance coverage. Negative covenants include, among others, covenants restricting us from transferring any part of our business or intellectual property, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, repurchasing shares, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, and creating other liens on our assets, including our intellectual property, in each case subject to customary exceptions. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. These restrictions may include, among other things, limitations on borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make investments. If we default under the terms of the Loan Agreement or any future debt facility, the Lenders may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. Further, if we are liquidated, the Lenders\u2019 right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. The Lenders could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that it interprets as a material adverse effect as defined under the Loan Agreement. Any declaration by the Lenders of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.\nRepayment of the Term Loan will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our indebtedness.\nOur ability to pay the principal of and/or interest on the Term Loan depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service the Term Loan or other future indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt and implement one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional debt financing or equity financing on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Term Loan or other future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, including the Term Loan.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate, odevixibat, which we are developing initially for the treatment of patients with PFIC and potentially also for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. If we are unable to commercialize odevixibat or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOdevixibat is in Phase 3 clinical development. Elobixibat has been approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic constipation, but we will not receive additional cash in respect of elobixibat in Japan as a result of our RIAA. Our other most advanced product candidates are in Phase 2 or earlier-stage development.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur until at least the end of 2021, if at all, will depend heavily on the approval of our NDA by the FDA and our MAA by the EMA and the successful commercialization of odevixibat as a treatment for patients with PFIC. Our ability to generate product revenues also depends on the successful development and commercialization of odevixibat to treat patients with biliary atresia or ALGS or A3907 or A2342 to treat adult liver and viral diseases. The success of each of these product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf receipt of marketing approval from the FDA and the EMA for odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC and marketing approvals for other indications or product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional capital, whether from potential future licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements or from any future offering of our debt or equity securities;\n\u25cf our ability to identify and enter into potential future licenses or other collaboration arrangements with third parties and the terms of the arrangements;\n\u25cf completion of clinical development with successful outcomes;\n\u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u25cf protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u25cf generating commercial sales of odevixibat, A3907 or A2342, as applicable, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf acceptance of odevixibat, A3907 or A2342, as applicable, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with other therapies; and\n\u25cf maintaining an acceptable safety profile of odevixibat, A3907 or A2342, as applicable, following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize odevixibat, A3907 or A2342, which would materially harm our business.\nIf clinical trials of odevixibat or any of our other product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of the applicable product candidate.\nIn connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. In particular, the small number of subjects and patients in our early clinical trials may make the results of these clinical trials less predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product candidate, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. There is no assurance that we will be able to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional or longer clinical trials or other testing of odevixibat or any of our other product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, or if the results of these clinical trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or restrictions; or\n\u25cf have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nFollowing consultation with the FDA and EMA, we used change in pruritus as the primary endpoint for purposes of FDA evaluation and as a key secondary endpoint for EMA evaluation in our recently completed Phase 3 trial in PFIC patients. There was no clinical experience with the two outcome instruments that we used in the trial and either may not be considered adequately reliable or valid for use in PFIC patients.\nIn September 2020, we announced topline results from our Phase 3 trial in PFIC, and in December 2020, we announced that we submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA, with the EMA granting accelerated assessment, seeking approval of odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC. The Phase 3 trial in PFIC met its two primary endpoints. In January 2021 we announced the FDA accepted our NDA, granting priority review and a user fee goal date under PDUFA of July 20, 2021. The primary endpoint for FDA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for EMA evaluation, was an assessment of change in pruritus. Because the assessment of pruritus relies on subjective caregiver feedback, it is challenging to evaluate and measure consistently and, for any patient, a caregiver-reported outcome may vary from the patient\u2019s self-reported outcome. The measure of pruritus can be influenced by factors outside of our control and can vary widely from measurement point to measurement point for a particular patient, from patient to patient and from site to site within a clinical trial.\nWe developed caregiver-reported and patient-reported outcome instruments to assess pruritus in the Phase 3 PFIC trial. These outcome instruments, and the manner in which they are analyzed, represent novel endpoints and measurement methodologies with which the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities have no experience. Notwithstanding the positive results in the Phase 3 trial, the FDA or EMA may ultimately determine that either of these outcome instruments is not adequately reliable or valid for use with PFIC patients, whether because it was not applied by clinical investigators sufficiently consistently, was not sufficiently sensitive to detect varying degrees of pruritus, or for any other reason. If this were to occur, our ability to obtain marketing approval for odevixibat would be delayed and we may never obtain marketing approval for odevixibat.\nOur pending NDA seeking approval to market odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC may be delayed as a result of ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions and safety protocols that could affect FDA\u2019s ability to conduct a pre-approval inspection of the drug product\u2019s manufacturing facility, or as a result of operational delays at the FDA or the EMA due to a redeployment of staff or other resources as part of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products, as well as routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities, and it also provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials, which has since been further updated several times. As of June 23, 2020, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission-critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. The FDA subsequently publicized its development and use of an internal rating system called the COVID-19 Advisory Rating system, to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct such inspections based on data about the virus\u2019s trajectory in a given country, state and locality and the rules and guidelines that are put in place by foreign, state and local governments. As of February 2021, FDA is either continuing to, on a case-by-case basis, conduct only \u201cmission-critical\u201d inspections, or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic\ninspections, which generally include pre-approval inspections (PAIs). Foreign PAIs that are not deemed mission-critical remain postponed, while those deemed mission-critical will be considered for inspection on a case-by-case basis. FDA will use similar data to inform resumption of other prioritized operations abroad as it becomes feasible and advisable to do so.\nDuring the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, moreover, there have been strategic redeployments of government resources to priority projects, including FDA and EMA resources and staff, which could have an impact on the timeline for review and approval of new marketing applications. Since the start of the pandemic, the FDA\u2019s new drug review programs continued to meet key performance goals related to working with applicants and approving NDAs and NDA supplements, although the agency has also stated that the uncertainty of the COVID-19 situation may make it difficult to sustain that level of performance indefinitely. The FDA may not be able to maintain its normal pace with respect to new drug applications and delays or setbacks are possible in the future. The FDA has told industry that it intends to be as transparent as possible about its workload and performance metrics as the situation evolves, and also that it intends to communicate proactively with applicants during the review cycle regarding the need for a pre-approval inspection and whether such PAI is considered \u201cmission-critical.\u201d\nShould FDA determine that a PAI is necessary for approval of an NDA or NDA supplement and such an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel or other safety protocols, FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter. Further, if there is inadequate information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility, FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. Such decisions will be based on the totality of the information available to the FDA, including considerations of whether it can obtain existing inspection reports from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition and confidentiality agreements and/or secure additional records from the applicant, the manufacturing facility, or other inspected entities. Accordingly, FDA has encouraged applicants to effectively communicate with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries from FDA for information needed to support its assessment of pending drug applications. FDA has also stated that it is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on NDAs such as the historical compliance status of a manufacturing facility and other risk-benefit considerations pertaining to the proposed new drug product and its manufacturing process and facilities. In addition, whether or not FDA considers a facility inspection to be \u201cmission-critical\u201d involves several factors related to the public health benefits of the proposed new drug product, including but not limited to whether the candidate has been granted breakthrough therapy designation and whether the candidate is intended to treat or prevent a serious disease or medical condition for which there is no other appropriate substitute. Regulatory authorities outside the United States, including but not limited to the EMA, may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot guarantee that our NDA for odevixibat will be approved before or on its user fee goal date, or that a necessary PAI inspection of one or both of our contract manufacturers for odevixibat will not have the potential to delay FDA approval of our NDA or lead to the issuance of a complete response letter. We are actively monitoring developments with respect to these matters, particularly because the contract manufacturers for odevixibat are located outside the U.S., and an inspection of one or both facilities will be required before our NDA for odevixibat can be approved.\nThe clinical trial designs, durations, endpoints and outcomes that will be required to obtain marketing approval of odevixibat to treat PFIC patients are uncertain and, in any case, may vary among the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities outside of the United States and Europe. Based on feedback that we have received from the FDA and the EMA, we expect both regulatory authorities to place a greater emphasis on the totality of the data from our Phase 3 clinical trial, including secondary endpoints, than may generally be expected. As a result, there is risk that, even though the primary endpoints of our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat for FDA evaluation purposes and for EMA evaluation purposes were met with statistical significance, the applicable regulatory authority may not find the overall results of our Phase 3 trial to be sufficient to support marketing approval of odevixibat to treat PFIC, a symptom of PFIC such as pruritus or any other indication, and we may never receive marketing approval.\nNo product is currently approved for the treatment of PFIC in the United States, the European Union or, to our knowledge, any other jurisdiction, and there is limited clinical experience in PFIC. Accordingly, there is not a well-established development path that, with positive outcomes in clinical trials, would be reasonably assured of receiving marketing approval for these indications.\nOur Phase 3 PFIC program included a single randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter clinical trial and an open label long-term extension study. In September 2020, we announced topline results from PEDFIC 1, our Phase 3 clinical trial for odevixibat, given once per day as an oral capsule or sprinkled over food, in patients ages 6 months to 18 years with PFIC types 1 and 2, which was conducted at 33 global sites. Both doses of odevixibat tested were statistically significant for each of the U.S. and E.U. primary endpoints. Odevixibat was well tolerated, with an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported during the study. In December 2020, we announced that we submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA, seeking approval of odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC. In January 2021 we announced the FDA accepted our NDA, with priority review and a user fee goal date under PDUFA of July 20, 2021.\nBased on feedback that we have received from the FDA and the EMA, we expect both regulatory authorities to place a greater emphasis on the totality of the data from our Phase 3 clinical trial, including secondary endpoints, than may generally be expected. As a result, there is risk that, even though the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat for FDA evaluation purposes or for EMA evaluation purposes was met with statistical significance, the applicable regulatory authority may not find the overall results of our Phase 3 trial to be sufficient to support marketing approval of odevixibat to treat PFIC, a symptom of PFIC such as pruritus or any other indication, and we may never receive marketing approval.\nFurthermore, the FDA has informed us that showing a clinically meaningful effect only on pruritus could support approval for the treatment of pruritus associated with PFIC and has indicated to us that meaningful improvements on one or more additional clinical benefit endpoints and/or corroborative real-world clinical evidence would be required to support approval for the treatment of PFIC itself. Certain secondary endpoints that we used in our Phase 3 trial may be considered clinical benefit endpoints, including progression to surgery and change in growth markers.\nFor PEDFIC 1, serum bile acid responder rate was the primary endpoint for purposes of EMA evaluation and a key secondary endpoint for FDA evaluation. To support the clinical utility of reduction in serum bile acids in the treatment of patients with PFIC, we are supporting an independent study pooling and analyzing long-term PFIC patient data from a number of leading PFIC academic centers, which we refer to as the PFIC Study Group. Should the data that are being accumulated by the PFIC Study Group come to a different conclusion than we anticipate about the relationship of serum bile acids to beneficial clinical outcomes, the EMA or the FDA may determine the results of the Phase 3 PFIC study not to be adequate to support approval.\nAlso, it is possible that any marketing authorization we may receive from the EMA for odevixibat for the treatment of PFIC could be conditional on post-authorization studies and not be considered a full authorization. Our ability to obtain and maintain conditional marketing authorization in the European Union will be limited to specific circumstances and subject to several conditions and obligations, if obtained at all, including the completion of a clinical outcomes trial to confirm the clinical benefit of odevixibat in PFIC. Conditional marketing authorizations based on incomplete clinical data may be granted for a limited number of listed medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under European Union law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions.\nThe FDA and EMA generally require two pivotal clinical trials to support marketing approval of a drug. In December 2020, we announced that we submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA, seeking approval of odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC. In January 2021 we announced the FDA accepted our NDA, with priority review and a user fee goal date under PDUFA of July 20, 2021. Our single Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PFIC, together with data from a long-term, open label extension study, forms the primary support for our applications for marketing approval of odevixibat in both the United States and European Union for treatment of patients with PFIC. If the FDA or EMA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials beyond the ones that we currently contemplate in order\nto support marketing approval of odevixibat to treat patients with PFIC in the United States or European Union, it would result in a more expensive and potentially longer development program for odevixibat than we currently contemplate, which could delay our ability to generate product revenues with odevixibat, interfere with our ability to enter into any potential licensing or collaboration arrangements with respect to this program, cause our value to decline, and limit our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to complete additional trials. Even though a single Phase 3 trial of odevixibat serves as the basis, together with safety data from an extension study to evaluate long-term outcomes, for an application for marketing approval for odevixibat in PFIC, either the FDA or the EMA may require that we meet the primary endpoint or endpoints in the trial at a higher level of statistical significance than would otherwise be required for a trial to be successful, which would reduce the likelihood of a positive trial.\nThe design of our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC did not conform precisely in all respects to the recommendations or preferences expressed by either the FDA or EMA.\nAlthough the feedback on our Phase 3 clinical trial design in patients with PFIC that we had received from the FDA and EMA is generally consistent, it was not identical and the design of our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC does not conform precisely in all respects to the recommendations or preferences expressed by either regulatory authority. As a result, there is increased risk that, even though we view the results of our trial as favorable, the FDA or EMA may not find the overall results to be sufficient to support marketing approval of odevixibat to treat PFIC, a symptom of PFIC such as pruritus or any other indication.\nFavorable results seen to date in clinical trials of odevixibat, including our Phase 3 trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC, may not be predictive of favorable results in our ongoing BOLD clinical trial of odevixibat in biliary atresia or our ongoing ASSERT clinical trial of odevixibat in ALGS.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials or in preclinical studies. Similarly, companies have experienced disappointing outcomes in later phases of a multiphase clinical trial, even after promising results in an early phase of the trial. Odevixibat has been evaluated in our Phase 3 trial in patients with PFIC, an open label Phase 2 trial in children with chronic cholestasis and pruritus and in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of PBC. Our Phase 3 trial in PFIC met its two primary endpoints, demonstrating that odevixibat reduced serum bile acid responses (sBAs) (p=0.003) and improved pruritus assessments (p=0.004) with a single digit diarrhea rate. Data from our Phase 2 trial in children with chronic cholestasis and pruritus showed a reduction in serum bile acids in a substantial majority of patients and improvement in pruritus that was significantly correlated with the reduction in serum bile acids. In addition, based on data from the PBC trial that we received from the investigator, nine patients with pruritus received odevixibat and all of them reported a reduction in pruritus. If the favorable findings on pruritus and serum bile acids seen in our Phase 3 trial and these two Phase 2 trials are not replicated in any other future trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC or other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we may not obtain marketing approval for odevixibat to treat any indication, in which case our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Phase 3 trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC involved a greater number of patients, different outcome measures, doses and treatment duration and had other differences in trial design, in addition to the difference in patient population, compared with either the prior pediatric chronic cholestasis trial or PBC trial. For example, our Phase 3 trial of odevixibat was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, clinical trial designed to enroll approximately 60 patients with PFIC (type 1 or 2), with a treatment duration of 24 weeks. The primary endpoint for FDA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for EMA evaluation, will be an assessment of change in pruritus. The primary endpoint for EMA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for FDA evaluation, will be serum bile acid responder rate, where a responder is a patient who achieves either a reduction in serum bile acid levels of 70% or more from baseline or a reduction of serum bile acid levels at least to an absolute level that is specified in between 50 and 100 \u00b5mol/l. Although we have assessed the effects of odevixibat on serum bile acids in prior clinical trials of odevixibat, we have not previously utilized this serum bile acid responder rate endpoint. Moreover, we did not have any prior data regarding the effect of a placebo in patients with PFIC on serum bile acid levels, pruritus or any other outcome variable to guide the planning for our Phase 3 PFIC trial, which increased the risk that the trial would not be powered adequately to show a statistically significant separation between odevixibat and placebo.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our pivotal clinical trials of odevixibat in patients with biliary atresia and Alagille syndrome, our receipt of marketing approval for odevixibat in those indications could be delayed or prevented.\nRecruiting patients for orphan pediatric liver diseases is challenging. We have previously experienced enrollment delays in our clinical trials of odevixibat. If we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates, we may not be able to initiate or continue the clinical trials. In particular, if we experience enrollment delays in our pivotal trials of odevixibat in patients with biliary atresia and Alagille syndrome, our cash resources may not be sufficient to enable us to fund the trial to completion, which could cause our value to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nPotential clinical trial participants may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases that we are targeting and may not meet the inclusion criteria for our trials. Biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome and other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases or disorders for which we may develop odevixibat are rare diseases or disorders with a limited patient populations, which could result in slow enrollment of clinical trial participants. Further, there are only a limited number of specialist physicians that treat these diseases and disorders, and major clinical centers that treat these diseases and disorders are concentrated in a few geographic regions.\nPatient enrollment is affected by many factors, including:\n\u25cf size of the target patient population;\n\u25cf severity of the disease or disorder under investigation;\n\u25cf eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question;\n\u25cf other clinical trials being conducted at the same time involving patients who have the disease or disorder under investigation;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf approval and availability of other therapies to treat the disease or disorder that is being investigated in the clinical trial;\n\u25cf willingness or unwillingness to participate in a placebo controlled clinical trial;\n\u25cf efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our planned clinical trials of odevixibat, or any of our other product candidates, would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIf the commercial opportunity in PFIC is smaller than we anticipate, or if odevixibat receives approval to treat only a specific subpopulation of patients with PFIC or only a specific symptom of PFIC such as pruritus, our future revenue from odevixibat may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nIf the size of the commercial opportunities in any of our target indications is smaller than we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve profitability and growth. We are developing odevixibat initially as a treatment for patients with PFIC and potentially also as a treatment for patients with other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, such as biliary atresia and ALGS. PFIC and these other diseases and disorders are each rare, with a limited patient population. Moreover, we expect that the addressable PFIC patient population for odevixibat is only a subset of the overall patient population, specifically patients who have not yet received partial external biliary diversion, or PEBD, surgery or liver transplant surgery or patients who have had PEBD reversal surgery. We are not aware of any available patient registries for PFIC, and we rely on various estimates and assumptions to estimate the addressable PFIC population. In addition, there are different subtypes of PFIC and the beneficial effects of odevixibat may vary among patients with different subtypes or among children of different ages. Our Phase 3 PEDFIC 1 clinical trial enrolled patients with PFIC, type 1 or 2, but not PFIC, type 3. Based on FDA feedback, odevixibat may ultimately receive regulatory approval, if at all, as a treatment for only the PFIC subtypes studied. It is also possible that odevixibat may ultimately receive regulatory approval, if at all, as a treatment for children with PFIC of some ages but not others. Moreover, we are using change in pruritus as the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 trial for purposes of FDA evaluation. The FDA has informed us that showing a clinically meaningful effect only on pruritus could support approval for the treatment of pruritus associated with PFIC and has indicated to us that meaningful improvements on one or more additional clinical benefit endpoints and/or corroborative real-world clinical evidence would be required to support approval for the treatment of PFIC itself. If the commercial opportunity in PFIC is smaller than we anticipate, whether because our estimates of the addressable patient population prove to be incorrect, because odevixibat receives marketing approval, if at all, as a treatment for some but not all PFIC subtypes, for children of some ages but not others, for pruritus associated with PFIC but not PFIC itself or for any other reason, our future revenue from odevixibat may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nIt is critical to our ability to grow and become profitable that we successfully identify patients with PFIC and any other rare cholestatic liver diseases and disorders that we may target in the future. Our projections of the number of people who have PFIC or our other potential target cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, as well as the subset who have the potential to benefit from treatment with odevixibat, are based on a variety of sources, including third-party estimates and analyses in the scientific literature, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new information may emerge that changes our estimate of the prevalence of these diseases or the number of patient candidates for odevixibat. The effort to identify patients with PFIC or our other potential target indications is ongoing, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the addressable patient population for odevixibat may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with odevixibat, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for odevixibat, we may never achieve profitability because the potential target patient population for odevixibat is small.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates, or entry into licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf we may be unable to recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf we may experience delays in reaching, or we may fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u25cf we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or undesirable side effects;\n\u25cf regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u25cf our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the clinical trials.\nFor example, in March 2015, Ferring International Center S.A., or Ferring, stopped early two Phase 3 clinical trials of elobixibat that Ferring had been conducting pursuant to a now-terminated license agreement with us due to an issue related to the distribution of study drug to study sites that was unrelated to the performance of elobixibat. We were unable as a result of the stopping of the trials to obtain data for the total number of patients for which the trials were designed, and the abbreviated trials are not sufficient to support an application for marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe benefit of IBAT inhibition in the treatment of patients with PFIC or any of our other target indications is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value for these indications.\nOdevixibat is an ileal bile acid transporter, or IBAT, inhibitor. There is no marketed drug in the United States or Europe that relies on IBAT inhibition for the treatment of PFIC or any other indication for which we plan to develop odevixibat. Shire plc, or Shire, reported that, SHP625, now known as maralixibat, which it licensed to and is now being developed by Mirum Pharmaceuticals, and has been reported to be an IBAT inhibitor, failed to meet the respective primary endpoints of Phase 2 clinical trials in multiple adult and pediatric indications. We cannot assure you that we will be able to replicate or improve upon our findings from preclinical studies and early clinical trials in later-stage clinical trials of odevixibat for any of our other target indications or that our focus on IBAT inhibition as a medically useful\nmechanism of action will result in the development of a commercially viable drug that safely and effectively treats PFIC or any of our other target indications.\nIf serious or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any other product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\nAll of our product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development (other than elobixibat for chronic constipation, which has been approved in Japan) and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have other unexpected, unacceptable characteristics, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many investigational products that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects or other safety issues that prevented further development.\nFor example, the investigator for the investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of odevixibat in PBC determined to conclude the trial prior to its intended completion, citing gastrointestinal side effects. If the GI side effects cited by the investigator in the PBC trial are predictive of an inadequate tolerability profile of odevixibat, the overall commercial opportunity for odevixibat may be lower than we expect. Even if we receive regulatory approval for odevixibat, if the approved dose of odevixibat is not well tolerated, odevixibat may not achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nEven if odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours receives marketing approval, the approved product may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If an approved product does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments or competitive products;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf whether physicians will be willing to prescribe odevixibat to patients with PFIC notwithstanding that the primary endpoint in our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC is change in pruritus (FDA) or serum bile acid responder rate (EMA), as opposed to a direct measure of reducing or eliminating progressive liver disease;\n\u25cf the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try and adhere to new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf the adequacy of supply of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u25cf the timing of any such marketing approval in relation to other product approvals;\n\u25cf support from patient advocacy groups; and\n\u25cf any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours that receives marketing approval.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell odevixibat or any of our other current or potential future product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing the applicable product candidate if it receives marketing approval.\nWe have limited experience as a company in the sale or marketing of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We are building the capabilities to commercialize odevixibat in the United States and Europe in anticipation of marketing approval for odevixibat to treat PFIC in those jurisdictions. Outside of the United States and Europe, we plan to selectively utilize collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize odevixibat. Also, we intend to selectively seek licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements to assist us in furthering the development or commercialization of product candidates, such as A3907 or A2342, targeting large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a PFIC or any other product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products to treat our target indications or markets before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nCompetitors may also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approvals from regulatory authorities and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies that may be complementary to or necessary for our programs.\nOur commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are approved for broader indications or patient populations, or are more convenient or less expensive than any products that we develop and commercialize. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn particular, we are aware of other companies that are developing product candidates that, like our product candidates odevixibat and elobixibat, act via IBAT inhibition. As noted above, Mirum is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of maralixibat in PFIC, for which it has reported that it expects to complete enrollment in the second quarter of 2021 and announce topline data by year-end 2021. As of February 2021, Mirum Pharmaceuticals announced the completion of a rolling NDA submission for maralixibat in ALGS, and is planning for a potential launch in ALGS in the second half of 2021. We understand that Mirum\u2019s MAA for maralixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC type 2 has been accepted for review by the EMA. If approved, our product candidates will compete for a share of the existing market with numerous other products. We believe that the primary competitive products for use in indications that we are currently targeting with our most advanced product candidates include the following.\n\u25cf For PFIC and many other cholestatic liver diseases, there are currently no approved drug treatments. First-line treatment for PFIC is typically off-label ursodeoxycholic acid, or UDCA, which is approved in France only for PFIC type 3, and in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment of PBC. PFIC patients often require surgical intervention such as PEBD surgery or liver transplant. As noted above, Mirum has initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial with maralixibat in PFIC, and plans to seek FDA approval for maralixibat as a treatment for pruritus associated with ALGS. We understand that Mirum\u2019s MAA for maralixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC type 2 has been accepted for review by the EMA. In addition, Intercept Pharmaceuticals\u2019 obeticholic acid, which is approved in the United States in combination with UDCA, or as a monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate UDCA, to treat PBC, is in Phase 2 development as a treatment for biliary atresia. GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s linerixibat is at the Phase 2 development stage as a treatment for pruritus associated with ALGS. In July 2019, Genfit SA received orphan designations from the FDA and EMA elafibranor for the treatment of PBC. Genfit has announced plans to advance elafibranor into a Phase 3 program for PBC in 2020. Gilead Sciences, Inc.\u2019s FXR agonist, cilofexor, has completed Phase 2 development for PBC, and is in Phase 3 development for PSC.\n\u25cf For the pruritus that is characteristic of many cholestatic liver diseases, symptomatic off-label treatment with: UDCA; bile acid sequestrants, such as generic cholestyramine (marketed as, Efensol, Ipocol,\nKolestran, Lipocol, Olestyr, Prevalite or Quantalan in various countries), marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. and Sandoz, the generic pharmaceuticals division of Novartis AG; rifampin, an antibiotic derivative; or naltrexone, an opioid antagonist.\n\u25cf For chronic constipation: linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, is marketed by Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Allergan as Linzess in the United States and as Constella (for the treatment of a related condition, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C) in Europe. Linaclotide is also marketed by Astellas Pharma Inc. as Linzess in Japan for the treatment of IBS-C; lubiprostone, a type-2 chloride channel marketed as Amitiza by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited in the United States and select countries in Europe and by Mylan N.V. in Japan; prucalopride, a motility agent marketed by Shire in the United States as Motegrity and in the European Union as Resolor; and numerous over the counter products, including psyllium husk (such as Metamucil), methylcellulose (such as Citrucel), calcium polycarbophil (such as FiberCon), lactulose (such as Cephulac), polyethylene glycol (such as MiraLax), sennosides (such as Exlax), bisacodyl (such as Ducolax), docusate sodium (such as Colace), magnesium hydroxide (such as Milk of Magnesia), saline enemas (such as Fleet) and sorbitol.\n\u25cf Plecanatide, marketed as Trulance by Bausch Health Companies, Inc. is approved in the United States to treat CIC and IBS-C. Ardelyx, Inc.\u2019s product, IBSRELA (tenapanor) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of IBS-C in September 2019.\nEven if we are able to commercialize odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any other product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted and, in some markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any other product candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. and E.U. healthcare industries and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any other product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for odevixibat may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug, and any launch of a competitive product is likely to create downward pressure on the price initially charged. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to a limited degree, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacturing, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk with respect to commercial sales of any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u25cf decreased demand for any products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants or sites;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf increased insurance costs; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe have separate liability insurance policies that cover each of our clinical trials, as well as a global product/clinical trial policy. These policies provide coverage in varying amounts, with the global policy having a per occurrence and aggregate limit of $10 million. The amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when and if we begin conducting more expansive clinical development of, or commercializing, odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates. Currently, we are focusing our resources predominantly on odevixibat. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with potential future product candidates that later could prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have historically based our research and development efforts on IBAT inhibitors, including odevixibat and elobixibat, to treat cholestatic liver diseases and CIC and on our proprietary formulations of, A3907 and A2342, as potential treatments for adult liver or viral diseases. Notwithstanding our investment to date and anticipated future investment, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed drugs using these approaches. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through licensing, collaboration or other royalty or similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through licensing, collaboration or other royalty or similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on EA Pharma for the successful commercialization of elobixibat to treat chronic constipation in Japan and for the successful development and commercialization of elobixibat to treat chronic constipation in other select markets in Asia. If EA Pharma does not successfully commercialize elobixibat in Japan, we may not receive any future payments under our license agreement with EA Pharma.\nWe entered into a license agreement with EA Pharma (formerly known as Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals) for elobixibat in April 2012. In January 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, approved a\nnew drug application filed by EA Pharma for elobixibat for the treatment of chronic constipation. EA Pharma co-markets elobixibat in Japan with another company, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, or Mochida, and co-promotes elobixibat in Japan with Eisai Co., Ltd.\nIn December 2017, the Company entered into a royalty interest acquisition agreement (RIAA) with HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. (HCR) pursuant to which it sold to HCR the right to receive all royalties from sales in Japan and sales milestones achieved from any covered territory potentially payable to the Company under the Agreement, up to a specified maximum \u201ccap\u201d amount of $78.8 million, based on the funds the Company received from HCR to date. The Company received $44.5 million from HCR, net of certain transaction expenses, under the RIAA. On June 8, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the RIAA with HCR pursuant to which HCR agreed to pay us an additional $14.8 million, net of certain transactions expenses, in exchange for the elimination of the (i) $78.8 million cap amount on HCR\u2019s rights to receive royalties on sales in Japan and sales milestones for elobixibat in certain other territories that may become payable by EA Pharma and (ii) $15.0 million payable to us if a specified sales milestone is achieved for elobixibat in Japan. The Company is obligated to make royalty interest payments to HCR under the RIAA only to the extent it receives future Japanese royalties, sales milestones or other specified payments from EA Pharma. Although the Company sold its rights to receive royalties from the sales of elobixibat in Japan, as a result of its ongoing involvement in the cash flows related to these royalties, the Company will continue to account for these royalties as revenue. Upon receipt of the payments from HCR the Company recorded the $59.3 million as a liability related to sale of future royalties (royalty obligation). The royalty obligation will be accreted using the effective interest rate method.\nThe Company records estimated royalties due for the current period in accrued other expenses until the payment is received from EA Pharma at which time the Company then remits payment to HCR. In order to determine the accretion of the royalty obligation, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received and submitted to HCR. The sum of these amounts less the $59.3 million proceeds the Company received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the royalty obligation. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s estimate of its total interest expense resulted in an annual effective interest rate of approximately 19.0%.\nThe Company periodically assesses the estimated royalty payments to HCR and to the extent such payments are greater or less than its initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than its original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the accretion of interest on the royalty obligation. There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and the timing of royalty payments, most of which are not within the Company\u2019s control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the rate of elobixibat prescriptions, the number of doses administered, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, patent protection, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to HCR are in U.S. dollars while sales of elobixibat are in Japanese yen, and sales never achieving forecasted numbers, which would result in reduced royalty payments and reduced non-cash interest expense over the life of the royalty obligation. To the extent future royalties result in an amount less than the liability, the Company is not obligated to fund any such shortfall.\nEA Pharma is responsible for all commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field (namely, all prophylactic or therapeutic uses of a pharmaceutical product for gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, symptoms of constipation of all causes or postoperative ileus, in colonoscopy cleansing procedures and, in specified circumstances, select liver diseases) in Japan and for all future development and commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field, and has substantial control over the conduct and timing of development efforts with respect to elobixibat in these countries. We have little control over the amount and timing of resources that EA Pharma devotes, or Mochida devotes, to the commercialization of elobixibat in Japan or to the development of elobixibat in these other countries. If EA Pharma or, where applicable, Mochida fails to devote sufficient financial and other resources, the commercialization of elobixibat in Japan and the development and potential commercialization of elobixibat otherwise in EA Pharma\u2019s licensed territory would be adversely affected. If this occurs, royalties that we could receive on any future elobixibat product sales could be delayed or reduced.\nEA Pharma has the right to terminate the elobixibat agreement on a country-by-country basis or in its entirety for an uncured material breach by us or in specified bankruptcy or similar events. EA Pharma also has the right, with\n180 days\u2019 notice, to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis (except for Japan) for any reason.\nIf EA Pharma terminates the elobixibat license agreement at any time, for any reason, it would negatively impact both the likelihood that we would receive any future payments under our license agreement with EA Pharma and the development of elobixibat in EA Pharma\u2019s licensed territory outside of Japan, would materially harm our business and could accelerate our need for additional capital. In particular, we would be required to seek a replacement licensee for Japan under the RIAA.\nIf we do not pursue the development and potential commercialization of elobixibat for the treatment of CIC in the United States or Europe, whether through a licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement or otherwise, the revenue that we will generate based on elobixibat may be lower.\nWe have commercial rights to elobixibat in the United States, Europe and otherwise outside of the territories licensed to EA Pharma. We do not have any current plan to seek a license or other partnering transaction with a third party for elobixibat for CIC in the United States or Europe. The cost and duration of the additional clinical trial or trials that would be required by the FDA and EMA to support marketing approval of elobixibat to treat CIC is currently uncertain. Even if we were to seek to establish licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement with a third party for the United States or Europe, the uncertain regulatory requirements may interfere with our ability to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not anticipate that we will conduct future clinical trials of elobixibat in CIC for the United States or Europe independently, whether or not we elect to seek a suitable third-party arrangement. If we do not enter into suitable third-party arrangements and do not ourselves conduct clinical trials of elobixibat in CIC for the United States or Europe, the revenue that we will generate based on elobixibat in CIC will be limited to future payments that we receive, if any, under our agreements with EA Pharma, which will reduce the overall commercial potential of elobixibat and may harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such clinical trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and government agencies, to perform this function. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity of data and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. We are also required to register clinical trials subject to FDA regulation and, with some exceptions, post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. The National Institutes of Health also has announced plans to require sponsors to post results of clinical trials for unapproved products, including unfavorable results in clinical trials for unapproved uses of approved products.\nFurthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nUse of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial supplies of our product candidates. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, in our product candidates. Our strategy is to outsource all manufacturing of our product candidates and any approved products to third parties.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term clinical or commercial supply of any of our product candidates. We currently engage a single third-party manufacturer to provide API for odevixibat and elobixibat. We also currently engage single third-party manufacturers to provide fill and finish services for the final drug product formulation of our product candidate in development. We may in the future be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, while we believe that there are alternative sources available to manufacture our product candidates, in the event that we seek such alternative sources, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without delays or additional expenditures. We cannot estimate these delays or costs with certainty but, if they were to occur, they could cause a delay in our development and commercialization efforts. If our third party manufacturing agreements are terminated or if the sources of supply from such arrangements are inadequate and we must seek supply agreements from alternative sources, we may be unable to enter into such agreements or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could delay a product launch or subject our commercialization efforts to significant supply risk.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022 the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022 the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nManufacturers of our product candidates are obliged to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP\u2019s. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with cGMPs requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with volume production, production costs and yields, laboratory testing, quality control, including stability of the product or product candidate, or quality assurance testing, or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations, any of which could result in our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet clinical timelines for a particular product candidate, to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate or to commercialize the product candidate. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide product for commercial sale or product candidates in our clinical trials would be jeopardized.\nIn addition, the facilities used by our contract manufacturers or other third party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections conducted following our request for regulatory approval for our product candidates from the FDA. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The\nFDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure of any of our current or future contract manufacturers to establish and follow cGMPs and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory approval of product candidates or the ultimate launch of products, if approved, into the market. Failure by our current or future third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers' failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates or approved products, entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nIf the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our preclinical tests and clinical trials cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. Furthermore, any delay or interruption in the supply of commercial quantities of approved product could have a material adverse impact on our revenue from product sales and any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical development programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials or redo work that has already been done, in either case at significant additional expense to us, or to terminate the clinical trials completely.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe may depend on additional collaborations, licenses or similar arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe have licensed rights to develop and commercialize elobixibat for CIC and other gastrointestinal diseases and disorders to EA Pharma in Japan and other select markets in Asia. We may in the future enter into other licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements for the development and commercialization of odevixibat, elobixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours for any or all indications and for any or all territories, except for the rights currently subject to EA Pharma\u2019s license with respect to elobixibat.\nOur likely counterparties for any licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Except for our agreement with EA Pharma, we are not currently party to any such arrangement for odevixibat, elobixibat A3907 or A2342. However, if we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties in the future, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nAny licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement involving our product candidates would pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus, including as a result of a sale or disposition of a business unit or development function, or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators may independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product relative to other products;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between us and a collaborator as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration;\n\u25cf we may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others or make us a less attractive collaboration partner by narrowing the scope of potential collaborations into which we may enter;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need to identify and enter into a new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement or obtain additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States, in Europe and in certain additional jurisdictions related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering the licensed technology or product candidates. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, in these circumstances, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future\npatent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents, narrow the scope of our patent protection or make enforcement more difficult or uncertain.\nThe laws of other countries may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in such foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, including certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patent rights or the marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. For this or other reasons, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets or may not obtain protection that enables us to prevent the entry of third parties onto the market.\nAdditionally, proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nFurther, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our U.S. patents or pending U.S. patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, reissue, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings, court litigation or International Trade Commission proceedings, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation concerning our patent rights could reduce the scope of or prevent the enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allowing third parties to commercialize our technology or products, or equivalent or similar technology or products, and so to compete directly with us, without payment to us, or, where such proceedings involve third-party patents, result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened or narrowed by operation of any of the foregoing, such an event could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or potential future product candidates of ours.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with adequate protection to prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise to provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar, improved or alternative technologies or products in a noninfringing manner. Moreover, method-of-treatment patent claims are more difficult to enforce than composition-of-matter claims for reasons including off-label sale, potential divided infringement issues and use of the subject compound in noninfringing manners. Physicians are permitted to prescribe an approved product for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe our method-of-treatment patents, the practice is common across medical specialties and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Off-label sales would limit our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. In addition, if a third party were able to design around our dosage-form and formulation patents and create a different formulation and dosage form that is not covered by our patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing our product.\nIn addition, other companies may attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, such as orphan drug exclusivity in the United States, which may require us to allocate significant resources to preventing such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data submitted as part of a marketing authorization application becoming publicly available. Such developments could enable other companies to use our clinical trial data to assist in their own product development and to obtain marketing authorizations in the European Union and in other jurisdictions. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain our patents.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Future changes in U.S. statutory or case law beyond our control could affect some or all of the foregoing possibilities. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. This could be the case even after giving effect to patent term extensions and data exclusivity provisions preventing third parties from relying on clinical trial data filed by us for marketing approval in support of their own applications for such approval. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other enforcement proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and potentially unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or that our patent and other intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable, including for antitrust reasons. As a result, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court or administrative body may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly and so refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the competitor technology in question. Even if we are successful in a patent infringement action, the unsuccessful party may subsequently raise antitrust issues and bring a follow-on action. Antitrust issues may also provide a bar to settlement or constrain the permissible settlement terms. Further, settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical sector are the subject of ongoing review by the antitrust authorities in the European Union.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our current or potential future licensees or collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, reexamination, reissue or post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and office proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as our business gains greater visibility operating as a publicly traded company in the United States. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights and so restrict our freedom to operate. Third parties may also seek injunctive relief against us, whereby they would attempt to prevent us from practicing our technologies altogether pending the outcome of any litigation against us. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates prior to their assertion against us. For example, we have not conducted an in depth freedom-to-operate search or analysis for odevixibat. Any freedom-to-operate search or analysis previously conducted may not have uncovered all relevant patents and pending patent applications, and there may be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing odevixibat or any other product candidate. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether odevixibat or any other product candidate, or our commercialization of any such product candidate, does not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to enable us to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be nonexclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies that we have then licensed, and could require us to make substantial payments. Absent a license, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties, or claims that we derived inventions from another, could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary or otherwise confidential information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have without authorization used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us and agreeing to cooperate and assist us with securing and defending our intellectual property, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. These assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar legislation outside of the United States by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or potential future product candidates of ours, if any, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension if, for example, we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, we fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or if we otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our products will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. In the event that we are unable to obtain any patent term extension, the issued U.S. composition of matter patent for odevixibat is expected to expire in 2022 assuming it withstands any challenge. In the event that we are unable to obtain any patent term extension, the issued U.S. composition of matter patent for elobixibat is expected to expire in 2022, assuming it withstands any challenge. We expect that the other U.S. patents and patent applications for odevixibat and elobixibat, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, would expire from 2031 to 2039.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate the trade secret, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates\nA rare pediatric disease designation may not lead to the receipt of a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, even if odevixibat is approved.\nThe FDA has awarded rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers, or PRVs, to sponsors of drug products intended to treat rare pediatric disease products if the treatment and product application meet certain criteria. Under this program, upon the approval of a qualifying NDA or biologics license application, BLA, for the treatment or prevention of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of the application may be eligible for a PRV that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The PRV may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. The FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation for odevixibat for PFIC. The PRV program is now set to expire at the end of 2024, or 2026 for products that receive rare pediatric disease designation by 2024.Therefore, there is no guarantee that we will receive a PRV for odevixibat even if it is approved by the FDA to treat a rare pediatric disease.\nIf prior to any marketing approval in the European Union of odevixibat to treat PFIC, Mirum\u2019s maralixibat is approved in the European Union to treat PFIC and at the time of approval maintains its designation as an orphan medicinal product, and if odevixibat is deemed to be a similar medicinal product, within the meaning of E.U. law, to maralixibat, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of odevixibat in the European Union for a significant period of time. In addition, odevixibat may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity for odevixibat in the United States or European Union notwithstanding its current orphan designation.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat, which is an IBAT inhibitor, for the treatment of PFIC, biliary atresia, PBC and ALGS, and the European Commission has designated odevixibat as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PFIC, biliary atresia, PBC and ALGS. Mirum\u2019s maralixibat, which has also been reported to be an IBAT inhibitor, has also been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission.\nGenerally, if a designated orphan medicinal product receives the first marketing approval in the European Union for the orphan indication for which it has been designated and maintains under applicable criteria its designation as an orphan medicinal product at the time of approval, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity in the European Union. Subject to certain exceptions, this market exclusivity precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d for the same indication for 10 years, which can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation (including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified). Under E.U. law, a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d is a medicinal product that contains a similar active substance or substances as contained in the authorized orphan medicinal product and that is intended for the same therapeutic indication and a \u201csimilar active substance\u201d is an active substance that is identical or has the same principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same molecular features) and acts via the same mechanism as the authorized orphan medicinal product.\nMaralixibat has been evaluated to date in a greater number of PFIC patients than has odevixibat. If (1) prior to marketing approval, if any, of odevixibat to treat PFIC in the European Union, maralixibat is approved in the European Union to treat PFIC and at the time of approval maintains its designation as an orphan medicinal product, (2) odevixibat is deemed to be a similar medicinal product to maralixibat and (3) we are not able to establish that odevixibat provides a significant benefit to patients compared with maralixibat, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of odevixibat in the European Union for at least several years. We understand that Mirum\u2019s MAA for maralixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC type 2 has been accepted for review by the EMA.\nMoreover, we may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity in the United States or the European Union for odevixibat for PFIC or any other indication, notwithstanding the fact that odevixibat has been designated as an orphan drug in the United States or an orphan medicinal product in the European Union. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug as odevixibat is shown to be clinically superior, any orphan drug exclusivity that we have obtained in the United States will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not\nprevent the approval in the United States of a product that is the same drug as our product candidate if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Moreover, if prior to marketing approval, if any, of odevixibat to treat PFIC in the European Union, maralixibat or any other product is approved in the European Union to treat PFIC, odevixibat may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity if we are not able to establish that it provides a significant benefit to patients compared with maralixibat. Finally, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drug products can be approved for the same condition.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates, including odevixibat, A3907 and A2342, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. In December 2020, we announced that we submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA, seeking approval of odevixibat for the treatment of patients with PFIC. Other than the approval of elobixibat received by EA Pharma for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan, we have not received approval to market odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any other product candidate from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction.\nWe have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates and have relied on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours is not effective, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies, clinical trials or other trials. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nAdditionally, on June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union took effect on January 31, 2020, the effective date of the withdrawal agreement, with a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom was, prior to Brexit, derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit and the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom that took provisional effect on January 1, 2021 could\nmaterially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of any product candidates in the United Kingdom. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing any product candidates in the United Kingdom and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nOur failure to obtain marketing approval in jurisdictions other than the United States and Europe would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in these other jurisdictions. Any approval that we are granted for our product candidates in the United States or Europe would not assure approval of product candidates in the other or in any other jurisdiction.\nIn order to market and sell odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidate of ours in jurisdictions other than the United States or Europe, we or a current or potential future licensee or collaborator must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States and Europe generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA and EMA approval. In addition, some countries outside the United States and Europe require approval of the sales price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, separate procedures must be followed to obtain reimbursement. We or a current or potential future licensee or collaborator may not obtain marketing, pricing or reimbursement approvals outside the United States and Europe on a timely basis, if at all.\nApproval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the EMA, approval by the EMA does not assure approval by the FDA, and approval of either or both of the FDA and EMA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Likewise, approval by any regulatory authority in any country or jurisdiction outside the United States or Europe, such as Japan, does not assure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA or EMA. We and any current or potential future licensee or collaborator may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market. Marketing approvals in countries outside the United States and Europe do not ensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing approvals and pricing approvals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained.\nOur ability to obtain and maintain conditional marketing authorizations in the European Union is limited to specific circumstances and subject to several conditions and obligations. A failure to renew any conditional approval that we obtain prior to full approval for the applicable indication would prevent us from continuing to market our products.\nConditional marketing authorizations in the European Union based on incomplete clinical data may be granted for a limited number of listed medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under E.U. law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies or trials, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions. Even if we obtain conditional approval for odevixibat for the treatment of PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we may not be able to renew such conditional approval.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture or market our products and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate profit.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the possible requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or to conduct costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to ensure that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP.\nAccordingly, to the extent we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have marketing approval for any of our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to strict enforcement of post-marketing requirements and we could be subject to substantial penalties, including withdrawal of our products from the market, if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing promotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\nThe FDA closely regulates compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws. Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n\u25cf litigation involving patients taking our products;\n\u25cf restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning or untitled letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of products;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u25cf damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u25cf unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf product seizure; or\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur noncompliance, or noncompliance by any future licensee or collaborator, with regulatory requirements relating to safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, to the development of products for the pediatric population or to the protection of personal information can lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nFast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The designation offers the sponsor opportunities for interactions with the FDA review team and the possibility of a rolling review for certain portions of the marketing application. The FDA has granted fast track designation for odevixibat for pruritus associated with PFIC, but there is no assurance that odevixibat will receive marketing approval from the FDA or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may also seek fast track designation for other current or potential future product candidates of ours. Even if the FDA grants fast track designation to one or more of these product candidates, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation that may in the future be granted to any of our product candidates if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program for that product candidate. Fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures.\nPriority review designation by the FDA may not lead to a faster regulatory review or approval process and, in any event, does not assure FDA approval.\nIf the FDA determines that a product candidate intended to treat a serious disease, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment of the disease, the FDA may designate the drug application for that product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review the marketing application is six months from the date of NDA acceptance for filing, rather than the standard review period of ten months from the date of NDA acceptance for filing. A priority review designation does not\nnecessarily mean a faster regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect to approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Receiving a priority review designation from the FDA does not guarantee approval of the drug application within the six-month review cycle or any time thereafter.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate, including odevixibat, A3907 or A2342, for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell or distribute any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and pharmacy benefit managers, among others. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback laws and regulations.\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Both the government and qui tam relators have brought False Claims Act actions against pharmaceutical companies on the theory that their practices have caused false claims to be submitted to the government.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. Among other payments, the law requires payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals for clinical trials be disclosed.\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of\nhealth information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Violation of certain of these laws could also result in exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare programs. Exclusion, suspension or debarment would significantly impact our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nLegislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain for any product that receives marketing approval.\nIn the United States and in some other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of odevixibat, A3907, A2342 or any potential future product candidates of ours, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, or affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates, including odevixibat A3907, or A2342, for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, became law in the United States. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Congress has expressed an intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, there are a number of state and local legislative and regulatory efforts related to drug pricing, including a drug price transparency law in Vermont that applies to pharmaceutical manufacturers, that may have an impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are unsure whether\nadditional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or whether such changes will have any impact on our business.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or E.U. member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures, and may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, data protection laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the government of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various statutes and rules in Europe and elsewhere around the world regulate privacy and data protection, which affect our collection, use, storage, and transfer of information both abroad and in the United States. New laws and regulations are periodically being enacted in this area, which remains in a state of flux. Monitoring and complying with these laws requires substantial financial resources. In particular, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May 2018, and will require us to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data about European Union residents. The GDPR is a complex law and the regulatory guidance is still evolving. Furthermore, many of the countries within the European Union are still in the process of drafting supplementary data protection legislation in key fields where the GDPR allows for national variation, including the fields of clinical study and other health-related information. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of our worldwide revenue. While we have taken steps to comply with the GDPR, including reviewing our security procedures, updating our website, revising our clinical study informed consent forms, and entering into data processing agreements with relevant contractors, we cannot assure you that our efforts to remain in compliance will be fully successful.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any\npotential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology or loss of data, including any cyber security incidents, could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability which could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we, our contract research organizations and other third parties on which we rely collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, breaches unauthorized access, interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, or damage from natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any such event could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct research, development and commercialization activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy, any of which could adversely affect our business. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a non-accelerated filer, we are not required this year to obtain an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 or any future testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. While our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2020, there is no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify material weaknesses in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Ron Cooper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our executive officers. The unplanned loss of the services of any of these persons could materially impact the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, including in the United States and Sweden, will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe expect to expand our capabilities and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, finance and administration and sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our\nmanagement and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe incur significant costs and demands as a result of operating as a public company.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to meet our obligations as a publicly traded company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that are not currently anticipated. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nWe are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations outside of the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a significant effect on our operating results when our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars. Exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies, the euro and the dollar create risk in several ways, including the following: weakening of the dollar may increase the cost of overseas research and development expenses and the cost of sourced product components outside the United States; strengthening of the dollar may decrease the value of our revenues denominated in other currencies; the exchange rates on-nondollar transactions and cash deposits can distort our financial results; and commercial pricing and profit margins may be affected.\nOur present and potential future international operations may expose us to business, political, operational and financial risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Some of our operations are located outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u25cf failure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\u25cf rejection or qualification of foreign clinical trial data by the competent authorities of other countries;\n\u25cf additional potentially relevant third-party patent and other intellectual property rights that may be necessary to develop and commercialize our products and drug candidates;\n\u25cf complexities and difficulties in obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf limits in our ability to penetrate international markets;\n\u25cf restrictions on traveling outside the United States;\n\u25cf financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf natural disasters, pandemics, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions, implementation of tariffs;\n\u25cf certain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation and insurance; and\n\u25cf regulatory and compliance risks that relate to anti-corruption compliance and record-keeping that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its accounting provisions or its anti-bribery provisions or provisions of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in other countries.\nAny of these factors could harm our ongoing international clinical operations and supply chain, as well as any future international expansion\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could adversely impact operations, make it more difficult for us to do business in Europe and impose additional regulatory costs and challenges in securing approval of our product candidate.\nOn June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union took effect on January 31, 2020, the effective date of the withdrawal agreement, with a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom entered into a trade agreement known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which is provisionally applicable as of January 1, 2021 but has not yet been ratified by the European Parliament. The United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty and volatility, particularly in relation to United Kingdom financial and banking markets. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business, and if such conditions emerge in the United Kingdom or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on operations and sales.\nCurrency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the U.S. dollar have already been adversely affected by Brexit and that may continue to be the case. In addition, the United Kingdom and the European Union have entered into a new Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which is designed to implement a new structure for trade agreements involving United Kingdom and the European Union, which may result in increased trade barriers and could make doing business in Europe more difficult.\nWe may also face new and additional regulatory costs and challenges from the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement that could have a material adverse effect on operations. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom was, prior to Brexit, derived from European Union directives and regulations, the new post-Brexit framework could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. We are currently evaluating the potential impacts on our business of the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement, including provisions relating to the manufacturing of medicinal products. Any delays to manufacturing or delays in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve\nand sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is expected to continue to be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop.\nThe market price of our common stock could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of clinical-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf the progress, scope, cost, duration or results of our current and any future clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the timing and success of submission, acceptance and approval of regulatory filings;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, delays or failures to obtain such approvals and any restrictions, limitations or warnings in the label of any approved product candidates;\n\u25cf failure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u25cf issues in manufacturing our approved products, if any, or product candidates;\n\u25cf the entry into, or termination of, licensing, collaboration or similar agreements, or other key agreements, and the agreement terms;\n\u25cf the initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u25cf adverse publicity relating to the markets in which we compete, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u25cf the introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our product candidates or products, if any;\n\u25cf the loss of key employees;\n\u25cf changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u25cf low trading volume;\n\u25cf general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u25cf failure to maintain compliance with listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market; and\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain, if any, of our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nAmong others, these provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board of directors;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a stockholder rights plan or \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all of our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 92032, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALBO"}
