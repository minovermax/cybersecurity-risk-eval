Risk Factors.\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nWe Are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers\u2019 Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in North America. If these expenditures decline, our business may suffer. Our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage,\n\u00b7\nthe prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas,\n\u00b7\nthe supply of and demand for drilling and pressure pumping equipment,\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,\n\u00b7\nthe environmental, tax and other laws and governmental regulations regarding the exploration, development, production and delivery of oil and natural gas, and in particular, public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state, foreign, regional and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate drilling and pressure pumping activities, including hydraulic fracturing, and\n\u00b7\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.\nIn particular, our revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nmarket supply and demand,\n\u00b7\ndomestic and international military, political, economic and weather conditions,\n\u00b7\nthe desire and ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC, to set and maintain production and price targets,\n\u00b7\nlegal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas,\n\u00b7\ntechnical advances affecting energy consumption and production, and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nAll of these factors are beyond our control. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, oil prices averaged $99.96 per barrel, natural gas prices averaged $4.59 per Mcf and demand for drilling activities increased. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, drilling activity slowed as oil prices averaged $73.16 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $3.80 per Mcf. Drilling activity has significantly decreased since December 31, 2014, as oil prices averaged $47.22 per barrel and natural gas prices averaged $2.99 per Mcf during January 2015. Our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and given current oil pricing and existing market trends, we expect our average number of rigs operating to continue to decline through at least the first quarter of 2015.\nWe expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Continued low market prices for oil and natural gas will likely result in decreased demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our drilling rigs and pressure pumping services.\nGlobal Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nGlobal economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices may cause our customers to reduce or curtail their drilling and well completion programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our services. In addition, uncertainty in the capital markets, whether due to global economic conditions, low commodity prices or otherwise may result in reduced access to financing by us, our customers and our suppliers and reduced demand for our services. Furthermore, these factors may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay suppliers, including us. The global economic environment in the past has experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period, and there is no assurance that the global economic environment will not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors, including a decline in the price for oil or natural gas. A deterioration in the global economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA General Excess of Operable Land Drilling Rigs, Increasing Rig Specialization and Excess Pressure Pumping Equipment May Adversely Affect Our Utilization and Profit Margins.\nThe North American oil and natural gas services industry has experienced downturns in demand during the last decade, including a downturn that started late in 2014. During these periods, there have been substantially more drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available than necessary to meet demand. As a result, drilling and pressure pumping contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins and, at times, have incurred losses during the downturn periods.\nConstruction of new technology drilling rigs has increased in recent years. The addition of new technology drilling rigs to the market, combined with a reduction in the drilling of vertical wells, has resulted in excess capacity of conventional drilling rigs. Similarly, the substantial recent increase in unconventional resource plays has led to higher demand for pressure pumping services and there has been a significant increase in the construction of new pressure pumping equipment across the industry. As a result of low oil and natural gas prices and the construction of new equipment, there is currently an excess of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment available. In circumstances of excess capacity, providers of contract drilling and pressure pumping services have difficulty sustaining profit margins and may sustain losses during downturn periods. We cannot predict the future level of demand for our contract drilling or pressure pumping services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling or pressure pumping businesses.\nIn addition, unconventional resource plays have substantially increased and some drilling rigs are not capable of drilling these wells efficiently. Accordingly, the utilization of some older technology drilling rigs may be hampered by their lack of capability to successfully compete for this work. Other ongoing factors which could continue to adversely affect utilization rates and pricing, even in an environment of high oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity, include:\n\u00b7\nmovement of drilling rigs from region to region,\n\u00b7\nreactivation of land-based drilling rigs, and\n\u00b7\nconstruction of new technology drilling rigs.\nShortages, Delays in Delivery and Interruptions in Supply of Drill Pipe, Replacement Parts, Other Equipment, Supplies and Materials Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nDuring periods of increased demand for drilling and pressure pumping services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, proppants, acid, gel and water. These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use. In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations. Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:\n\u00b7\nweather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane, or long-term such as a drought,\n\u00b7\ntransportation and other logistical challenges, and\n\u00b7\na shortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties.\nThese price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims. We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages.\nWe have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our drilling and pressure pumping contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage. Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to\nnegligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our rigs and certain other assets, employer\u2019s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and insurance for other specific risks. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, our drilling rigs and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of the rigs or other assets. We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies. For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers\u2019 compensation and equipment insurance coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention on our general liability coverage and a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our automobile liability insurance coverage. We self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption, and do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.\nOur insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage. There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive or that our coverage will cover a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nNew Technologies May Cause Our Operating Methods and Equipment to Become Less Competitive, and Higher Levels of Capital Expenditures May Be Necessary to Remain Competitive in our Industry.\nThe market for our services is characterized by continual technological and process developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs. Accordingly, a higher level of capital expenditures may be required to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment and purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. In addition, technological changes, process improvements and other factors that increase operational efficiencies could result in oil and natural gas wells being drilled and completed more quickly, which could reduce the number of revenue earning days. Technological and process developments in the pressure pumping business could have similar effects.\nIn recent years, we have added drilling rigs to our fleet through new construction, and we have purchased new pressure pumping equipment. Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements in competitors\u2019 equipment could make our equipment less competitive.\nIf we are not successful in building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment or upgrading our existing rigs and pressure pumping equipment in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose market share. One or more technologies that we implement in the future may not work as we expect, and we may be adversely affected. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or pressure pumping equipment obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.\nOur Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Not Ultimately Be Realized as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $1.5 billion. Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an early termination payment to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of\ntime, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. Additionally, during depressed market conditions or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations. In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to cancel or negotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above. As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog. In addition, the renegotiation or termination of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Oil Service Business Sectors in Which We Operate Are Highly Competitive with Excess Capacity, which Adversely Affects Our Operating Results.\nThe land drilling and pressure pumping businesses are highly competitive. At times, particularly in low commodity price environments, available land drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment exceed the demand for such equipment. This excess capacity has resulted in substantial competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts. The ability to move drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry.\nWe believe that price competition for drilling and pressure pumping contracts will continue to be intense due to the existence of available rigs and pressure pumping equipment. As a result of competition, our utilization may decrease and/or we may be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nReliance on Management and Competition for Experienced Personnel May Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe greatly depend on the efforts of our key employees to manage our operations. The loss of members of management could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses. In times of increasing demand for our services, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. During periods of high demand for our services, wage rates for operations personnel are also likely to increase, resulting in higher operating costs. The loss of key employees, the failure to obtain or attract and retain qualified personnel and increased wage rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Loss of Large Customers Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWith respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2014, we received approximately 41% from our ten largest customers, 28% from our five largest customers and 16% from our two largest customers. The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGrowth Through the Building of New Rigs and Pressure Pumping Equipment and Rig and Other Acquisitions Are Not Assured.\nWe have increased our drilling rig fleet and pressure pumping horsepower in the past through mergers, acquisitions and new construction. There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available in the future or that we will be able to execute timely or efficiently any plans for building new rigs and pressure pumping equipment. We are also likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities. In addition, because improved technology has enhanced the ability to recover oil and natural gas, contract drillers may continue to build new, high technology rigs and providers of pressure pumping services may continue to build new, high horsepower equipment.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u00b7\nhave sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions or build new rigs or pressure pumping equipment,\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully integrate additional drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets or businesses,\n\u00b7\neffectively manage the growth and increased size of our organization, drilling fleet and pressure pumping equipment,\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully deploy idle, stacked or additional rigs and pressure pumping equipment,\n\u00b7\nmaintain the crews necessary to operate additional drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, or\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of any completed acquisition or the building of new drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions, build new drilling rigs or build new pressure pumping equipment and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such acquisitions or building program. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.\nEnvironmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks, and the use of underground injection wells. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be substantial. A failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to:\n\u00b7\nsubstantial civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties,\n\u00b7\nmodification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations,\n\u00b7\nimposition of limitations on our operations, and\n\u00b7\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nIn addition, environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate impose a variety of requirements on \u201cresponsible parties\u201d related to the prevention of spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of land-based drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and such laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs for us and our customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cNESHAPS\u201d) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or \u201cgreen completions\u201d on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. In addition, gas wells are now required to use completion combustion device equipment (i.e., flaring) if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. Further, the final rules under NESHAPS include Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for \u201csmall\u201d glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. These rules may require the implementation of new operating standards which may impact our business. In 2012, seven states sued the EPA to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether setting standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources is appropriate and, if so, to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and natural gas sources. In April 2014, the EPA released a set of five white papers analyzing methane emissions from the industry. In January 2015, EPA announced plans to issue a proposed rule in summer 2015 governing methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. If these or other initiatives result in an increase in regulation, it could increase costs to us and our customers or reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nPotential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress and the EPA are reviewing proposals for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology employed by our pressure pumping business, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. For example, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. As part of this study, the EPA sent requests to a number of companies, including our company, for information on their hydraulic fracturing practices. We have responded to the inquiry. The EPA released a progress report on December 21, 2012 outlining work currently underway and is expected to release a draft final report in early 2015. This and other ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course, and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) or other regulatory mechanism. In addition, legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to amend the SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process\nare impairing ground water or causing other damage. These bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal or state level that could limit or delay operational activities or increase operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform or limit hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nRegulatory efforts at the federal level and in many states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain \u201cdiesel fuel\u201d under the SWDA Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain states where we operate have adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations. For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Louisiana, and Wyoming have adopted a variety of well construction, set back and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. Additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business and could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.\nFinally, some jurisdictions have taken steps to enact hydraulic fracturing bans or moratoria. New York announced in December 2014 that it will ban high volume fracturing activities combined with horizontal drilling. Certain communities in Colorado have also enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing. Voters in the city of Denton, Texas also recently approved a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing. These actions have been the subject of legal challenges.\nThe adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and could increase our costs of compliance and doing business and reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nLegislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nWe are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources on an annual basis. Further, following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA finalized a rule to address permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act\u2019s New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V programs. This final rule \u201ctailors\u201d the PSD and Title V programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting. Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations. The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nLegal Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on our Business.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nPolitical, Economic and Social Instability Risk and Laws Associated with Conducting International Operations Could Adversely Affect our Opportunities and Future Business.\nWe currently conduct operations in Canada, and we have incurred selling, general and administrative expenses related to the evaluation of and preparation for other international opportunities. International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties generally not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social and political unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contractual rights, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, changes in taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we may operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the cost of entry into international markets, the profitability of international operations or the ability to continue those operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, any future international operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u00b7\nidentify attractive opportunities in international markets,\n\u00b7\nhave sufficient capital resources to pursue and consummate international opportunities,\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully integrate international drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets or businesses,\n\u00b7\neffectively manage the start-up, development and growth of an international organization and assets,\n\u00b7\nhire, attract and retain the personnel necessary to successfully conduct international operations, or\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of the entry into one or more international markets.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some of the parts of the world where contract drilling and pressure pumping activities are conducted have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practice and could impact business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject to us to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment or other assets.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance an international transaction or operations and also may issue equity, convertible or debt securities in connection with any such transactions or operations. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition, and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, international expansion could strain our management, operations, employees and other resources.\nThe occurrence of one or more events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur Business Is Subject to Cybersecurity Risks and Threats.\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nWe Are Dependent Upon Our Subsidiaries to Meet our Obligations Under Our Long Term Debt\nWe have borrowings outstanding under our senior notes, term loan facility and, from time to time, revolving credit facility. These obligations are guaranteed by each of our existing U.S. subsidiaries other than immaterial subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our interest and principal payment obligations depends in large part on dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flows to pay us dividends, we may be unable to meet our interest and principal payment obligations.\nVariable Rate Indebtedness Subjects Us to Interest Rate Risk, Which Could Cause Our Debt Service Obligations to Increase Significantly.\nWe have in place a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility. Interest is paid on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the credit facility at a floating rate based on, at our election, LIBOR or a base rate. The margin on LIBOR loans ranges from 2.25% to 3.25% and the margin on base rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.25%, based on our debt to capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2014, the margin on LIBOR loans was 2.25% and the margin on base rate loans was 1.25%. Based on our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2014, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 2.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans will be 1.75% as of April 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we had $303 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.65% and $82.5 million outstanding under our term credit facility at an interest rate of 2.50%. A one percent increase in the interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term credit facility as of December 31, 2014 would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $3.8 million. Interest rates could rise for various reasons in the future and increase our total interest expense, depending upon the amounts borrowed.\nAnti-takeover Measures in Our Charter Documents and Under State Law Could Discourage an Acquisition and Thereby Affect the Related Purchase Price.\nWe are a Delaware corporation subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203, an anti-takeover law. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of that stock without further vote or action by the holders of the common stock. It also prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent without the holding of a meeting. In addition, our bylaws impose certain advance notification requirements as to business that can be brought by a stockholder before annual stockholder meetings and as to persons nominated as directors by a stockholder. As a result of these measures and others, potential acquirers might find it more difficult or be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us. This may deprive holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities at above-market prices pursuant to any such transactions.", "PERMNO": 79857, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "PTEN"}
