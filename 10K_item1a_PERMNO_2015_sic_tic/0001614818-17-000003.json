RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face and of which we are currently aware, and all of the other information contained in this report. If any of the events or developments described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe payment processing industry is highly competitive and such competition is likely to increase, which may adversely influence the prices we can charge to merchants for our services and the compensation we must pay to our distribution partners, and as a result, our profit margins.\nThe payment processing industry is highly competitive. We primarily compete in the small and medium business (\u201cSMB\u201d) merchant industry. Competition has increased in recent years as other providers of payment processing services have established a sizable market share in the SMB merchant industry, with the largest ten processors representing approximately 80% of the SMB market. Our primary competitors for SMB merchants in these markets include financial institutions and their affiliates and well-established payment processing companies that target SMB merchants directly and through third parties, including Bank of America Merchant Services, Chase Paymentech, Elavon, Inc. (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), First Data Corporation, Vantiv, Inc., Global Payments, Inc., Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. (an affiliate of Global Payments, Inc.), BluePay and Square, Inc. Competing with financial institutions is challenging because, unlike us, they often bundle processing services with other banking products and services. We also compete with many of these same entities for the assistance of distribution partners. For example, many of our distribution partners do not have exclusive relationships with us but also have relationships with our competitors, such that we have to continually expend resources to maintain those relationships. Our continued growth will depend on the continued growth of payments with prepaid, debit and credit cards and bitcoin, which we refer to as \u201cElectronic Payments,\u201d and our ability to increase our market share through successful competitive efforts to gain new merchants and distribution partners.\nIn addition, many financial institutions, subsidiaries of financial institutions or well-established payment processing companies with which we compete, have substantially greater capital, technological, management and marketing resources than we have. In addition, our competitors that are financial institutions or affiliated with financial institutions may not incur the sponsorship costs we incur for registration with the payment networks. These factors may allow our competitors to offer better pricing terms to merchants and more attractive compensation to distribution partners, which could result in a failure to establish relationships with potential, and loss of our existing, merchants and distribution partners. This competition may limit the prices we can charge our merchants, cause us to increase the compensation we pay to our distribution partners and require us to control costs aggressively in order to maintain acceptable profit margins. Our future competitors may also develop or offer services that have price or other advantages over the services we provide. Such competition could result in a loss of existing clients, and greater difficulty attracting new clients. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also face new competition from emerging and non-traditional payment processing companies as well as traditional companies offering alternative electronic payments services and products. Some of these competitors integrate proprietary software and service solutions with electronic payments services and have significant financial resources and robust networks that allow them to have access to merchants needing electronic payments services. If these competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions, they could impact our ability to retain and grow our relationships with merchants and distribution partners. These competitors may also compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional, point of sale, or \u201cPOS\u201d software in the electronic payments process upon which our services are based, which could also limit our ability to retain or grow those relationships. If we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on distribution partners, who may not serve us exclusively and are subject to attrition, to acquire and retain a segment of our merchants.\nWe rely heavily on the efforts of integrated service vendors and referral partners to market our services to merchants seeking to establish a merchant acquiring relationship. These distribution partners seek to introduce us, as well as our competitors, to newly established and existing SMB merchants, including retailers, restaurants and other businesses. Generally, our agreements with distribution partners (with the exception of a portion of our integrated technology partners and bank referral partners) are not exclusive and distribution partners retain the right to refer merchants to other merchant acquirers. Gaining and maintaining loyalty or exclusivity can require financial concessions to maintain current distribution partners and merchants or to attract potential distribution partners and merchants from our competitors. We have been required, and expect\nto be required in the future, to make concessions when renewing contracts with our distribution partners. Such concessions can have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance. If these distribution partners switch to another merchant acquirer, cease operations or become insolvent, we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from them, and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by them. Additionally, our distribution partners are subject to the requirements imposed by our bank sponsors, which may result in fines to them for non-compliance and may, in some cases, result in these entities ceasing to refer merchants to us. We cannot accurately predict the level of attrition of our distribution partners or merchants in the future, particularly those merchants we acquired as customers in the portfolio acquisitions we have completed in recent years, which makes it difficult for us to forecast growth. If we are unable to establish and expand relationships with distribution partners or merchants, or otherwise increase our transaction processing volume in order to counter the effect of this attrition, our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nContinued consolidation in the banking industry could adversely affect our growth.\nHistorically, the banking industry has been the subject of consolidation, regardless of overall economic conditions. As banks consolidate, our relationships with banks are brought into question. If a current financial institution referral partner of ours is acquired by another bank, the acquiring bank may seek to terminate our agreement and impose its own merchant services program on the acquired bank. If a financial institution referral partner acquires another bank, our financial institution referral partner may take the opportunity to conduct a competitive bidding process to determine whether to maintain our merchant acquiring services or switch to another provider. In either situation, we may be unable to retain the relationship post-acquisition, or may have to offer financial concessions to do so, which could adversely affect our growth.\nIf we cannot successfully complete acquisition of complementary business, services or technologies, we may not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nAcquisitions are part of our growth strategy. We evaluate, and expect in the future to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or technologies. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as stated elsewhere in this Report for a description of recent acquisitions. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete suitable acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including the identification of and competition for acquisition targets, the need for regulatory approvals, the inability of the parties to agree to the structure or purchase price of the transaction and our inability to finance the transaction on commercially acceptable terms. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies, products or technologies, which could divert management\u2019s attention, resulting in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers, and other constituents within our industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\ncoordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement or improve controls, policies and procedures at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\npotential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nAdditionally, certain acquisitions we make may also prevent us from competing for certain clients or in certain lines of business. For example, acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with existing or future merchants or distribution partners, in particular, to the extent we consummate acquisitions that increase our sales and distribution capabilities.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and otherwise harm our business. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of merchant or cardholder data, whether through breach of our computer systems, computer viruses, or otherwise, could expose us to liability, long and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nWe are responsible for data security for ourself and for third parties with whom we partner and under the rules and regulations established by the payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express, and debit card networks. These third parties include merchants, our distribution partners and other third-party service providers and agents. We and other third parties collect, process, store and/or transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, credit or debit card numbers and expiration dates, driver\u2019s license numbers and bank account numbers. We have ultimate liability to the payment networks and our bank sponsors for our failure or the failure of third parties with whom we contract to protect this data in accordance with payment network requirements. The loss, destruction or unauthorized modification of merchant or cardholder data by us or our contracted third parties could result in significant fines, sanctions and proceedings or actions against us by the payment networks, governmental bodies, consumers or others.\nThreats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. For example, certain of our employees have access to sensitive data that could be used to commit identity theft or fraud. Concerns about security increase when we transmit information electronically because such transmissions can be subject to attack, interception or loss. Also, computer viruses can be distributed and spread rapidly over the Internet and could infiltrate our systems or those of our contracted third parties. Denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including interfering with our services or to create a diversion for other malicious activities. Any such actions or attacks against us or our contracted third parties could disrupt our delivery of services or make them unavailable which could hurt our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in remediating the resulting impacts, expose us to uninsured liability, result in the loss of our bank sponsors or our ability to participate in the payment networks, subject us to lawsuits, fines or sanctions, distract our management or increase our costs of doing business.\nWe and our contracted third parties could be subject to breaches of security by hackers. Our encryption of data and other protective measures may not prevent unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data. System breaches may subject us to material losses or liability, including payment network fines, assessments and claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated credit, debit or card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. Data misuse or a cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation and deter merchants from using electronic payments generally and our services specifically, thus reducing our revenue. In addition, any such misuse or breach could cause us to incur costs to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, and result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under state and federal laws or by the payment networks. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. In addition, a significant cybersecurity breach of our systems or communications could result in payment networks prohibiting us from processing transactions on their networks or the loss of our bank sponsors that facilitate our participation in the payment networks, either of which could materially impede our ability to conduct business.\nAlthough we generally require that our agreements with distribution partners or our service providers which may have access to merchant or cardholder data include confidentiality obligations that restrict or limit these parties from using or disclosing any merchant or cardholder data, we cannot guarantee that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data or allow us to seek reimbursement from the contracted party. In addition, many of our merchants are SMBs that may have limited competency regarding data security and handling requirements and may experience data breaches. Any unauthorized use, modification, destruction or disclosure of data could result in long and costly litigation, as well as significant losses.\nIn addition, our agreements with our bank sponsors and our third-party payment processors (as well as payment network requirements) require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data. Any failure to adequately comply with these protective measures could result in fees, penalties, litigation or termination of our bank sponsor agreements.\nAny significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data entrusted to us would cause significant damage to our reputation, and impair our ability to attract new integrated technology and referral partners, and may cause parties with whom we already have such agreements to terminate them.\nPotential distribution partners and merchants may be reluctant or refuse to switch to a new merchant acquirer, which may adversely affect and limit our growth.\nMany potential distribution partners and merchants are concerned about potential disadvantages associated with switching merchant acquirers, such as a loss of accustomed functionality, increased costs and business disruption. For our distribution partners, switching to us from another merchant acquirer or integrating with us may constitute a significant undertaking involving significant time and expense associated with integration. As a result, many distribution partners and merchants often resist such change. There can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential reluctance to change vendors or initiate a relationship with us will be successful, and this resistance may adversely affect our growth and performance results.\nAs we increase our sales efforts toward larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle becomes more time-consuming and expensive, which may adversely affect our business.\nWhile the primary source of our revenue is derived from the SMB merchant segment, we also compete in, and have increased our sales efforts toward, larger businesses that primarily utilize sophisticated Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems to manage their businesses (referred to as \u201cEnterprise\u201d customers). As we increase our sales efforts to Enterprise customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing such sales. A prospective Enterprise customer\u2019s decision to use our solutions may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these sales require us to provide significant education to the prospective customer about our products\u2019 uses and benefits. Additionally, implementation of our services with Enterprise customers is typically more costly and time consuming because larger customers typically demand more customization, integration services and features. Consequently, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual sales, increasing the costs and time required to complete such sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our Enterprise customer base or effectively scale our sales and professional resources in pursuit of Enterprise sales and, if we do not do so, our sales efforts to obtain such customers may become time consuming, costly and harmful to our financial performance.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, and any new laws and regulations, industry standards or revisions made to existing laws, regulations or industry standards affecting the electronic payments industry may have an unfavorable impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations that affect electronic payments including U.S. financial services regulations, consumer protection laws, escheat regulations, and privacy and information security regulations. Regulation of our industry has increased significantly in recent years. Changes to statutes, regulations or industry standards, including interpretation and implementation of such statutes, regulations or standards, could increase our cost of doing business or affect the competitive balance. Failure to comply with regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, including the limitation, suspension or termination of services provided to, or by, third parties, and the imposition of penalties or fines.\nInterchange fees, which are typically paid by the payment processor to the issuer in connection with electronic payments, are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory, and legislative scrutiny. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or The Dodd-Frank Act, significantly changed the U.S. financial regulatory\nsystem, including by regulating and limiting debit card fees charged by certain issuers, allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and allowing merchants to offer discounts or other incentives for different payment methods.\nRules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act also contain certain prohibitions on payment network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. These restrictions could limit the number of debit transactions, and prices charged per transaction, which would negatively affect our business. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, has assumed responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has the authority to determine whether any non-bank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, because it is systemically important to the U.S. financial system. Any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business, which increase our risk profile and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and many of our merchants are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, which, along with other applicable laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, may directly impact the activities of certain of our merchants and, in some cases, may subject us, as the merchant\u2019s electronic processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we are deemed to have improperly aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the merchant through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in unfair or deceptive practices or violate other laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we are processing payments or providing services for a merchant that may be in violation of laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.\nOur business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or the FCRA, which regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. We could be subject to liability if our practices do not comply with the FCRA or regulations under it.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, requires the filing of yearly information returns by payment processing entities like us and third-party settlement organizations with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements. We could be liable for penalties if our information returns do not comply with these regulations.\nThis regulatory landscape may require us to make significant changes to our products and services and to incur additional compliance costs and change how we price our services to merchants. Implementing new compliance efforts may be difficult because of the complexity of existing and new regulatory requirements and the significant time and resources required to ensure compliance. Furthermore, regulatory actions may cause changes in business practices by us and other industry participants which could affect how we market, price and distribute our products and services, which could limit our ability to grow, reduce our revenues, or increase our costs. Even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulation, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation could damage our business or our reputation\nAs the Trump presidency and the new Congress get under way, it is too early to predict the changes in law and regulation that may result from the change in administration. However, it is possible that any such changes or developments in law and regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to or use of consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services to merchants.\nThe United States government has adopted laws and regulations restricting the use, collection, storage, and transfer of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. Our operations are subject to certain provisions of these laws. Relevant federal privacy laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. In addition, there are state laws restricting the ability to collect\nand utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver\u2019s license numbers. Certain state laws impose obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and consumer reporting agencies and businesses and governmental agencies that own data.\nIn connection with providing services to our merchants, we are required by law and our merchant and referral partner contracts to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These contracts require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines. The compliance standards relate to our infrastructure, components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract, grow and maintain business in the future. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the protection of data privacy, we could be exposed to breach of contract claims or governmental proceedings. In addition, our relationships and reputation could be harmed, which could inhibit our ability to retain existing merchants and distribution partners and obtain new merchants and distribution partners.\nIf more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future, our compliance costs may increase. Additionally, our opportunities for growth may be reduced by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm, and our potential liability for security breaches may increase.\nFailure to comply with the rules established by payment networks or standards established by third-party processors could result in those networks or processors imposing fines or the networks suspending or, terminating our registrations through our bank sponsors.\nIn order to provide our merchant acquiring services, we are registered through our bank sponsors with the Visa and MasterCard networks as service providers for member institutions. We are also registered directly with other payment networks, including Discover and American Express. As such, we and our merchants are subject to payment network rules. The payment networks routinely update and modify requirements applicable to merchant acquirers including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships (such as those with respect to bank sponsors), merchant chargeback standards and Payment Card Industry and Data Security Standards (the \u201cPCI DSS\u201d). Standards governing our third-party processing agreements may also impose requirements with respect to compliance with PCI DSS.\nIf we do not comply with the payment network requirements or standards governing our third-party processing agreements, our transaction processing capabilities could be delayed or otherwise disrupted. Recurring non-compliance could result in fines as well as the payment networks suspending or terminating our registrations to process transactions on their networks, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.\nWe have received notices of non-compliance and fines, which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant, data security failures, or non-compliance with PCI DSS on the part of a merchant. If we are unable to resolve the issues presented in such notices, recover fines from or pass-through such costs to our merchants, or recover losses under insurance policies, we would incur financial losses that could be significant. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. In addition, even if we comply with the PCI DSS, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the PCI DSS. The termination of our registration with the payment networks, or any changes in payment network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide merchant acquiring services, could adversely affect our payment processing volumes, revenues and operating costs. If audits or self-assessments under PCI DSS identify any deficiencies requiring remediation, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and be expensive and time consuming which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nChanges in payment network rules or standards could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPayment network rules are established and changed from time to time by each payment network as they determine in their sole discretion with or without advance notice to their participants. Timelines imposed by the payment networks for expected compliance with new rules have historically been, and may continue to be, highly compressed, requiring us to quickly implement changes to our systems which increases the risk of non-compliance with new standards or the costs associated with such implementation. Also, the payment networks could change interchange or other elements of the pricing structure of the merchant acquiring industry that would negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs an example, under the recent payment network standard known as Europay Mastercard and Visa (\u201cEMV\u201d) that requires POS systems to accept more secure \u201cchip\u201d cards and sets new rules for data handling and security, we are liable to our EMV networks for losses resulting from fraudulent Electronic Payments made at our merchant customers that have not complied with the mandate by implementing EMV compliant payment terminals. Our contracts seek to mitigate this risk by allowing us to recover these fraud-related losses from our merchant customers. However, our merchant customers may be insolvent or we may be unable to recover these fraud-related losses in full or at all. We have invested significant resources to ensure our systems\u2019 compliance and to assist our merchants in becoming EMV compliant. Any failure to recover fraud-related losses from our merchants that have not complied with EMV standards could result in material losses.\nThere may be a decline in the use of Electronic Payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the electronic payments industry in general which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMaintaining and increasing our profitability is dependent on consumers and businesses continuing to use credit, debit and prepaid cards at the same or greater rate than previously. If consumers do not continue to use these cards for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash and Electronic Payments that is adverse to us, our business could decline and we could incur material losses. Regulatory changes may also cause merchants to charge customers additional fees for use of Electronic Payments. Additionally, in recent years, increased incidents of security breaches have caused some consumers to lose confidence in the ability of retailers to protect their information, causing such consumers to discontinue their use of electronic payment methods. In addition, security breaches could cause financial institutions and consumers to cancel large numbers of credit and debit cards following such an incident.\nOur ability to remain competitive and increase our earnings and revenues depends on our ability to develop products and services to address the rapidly evolving market of the electronic payments industry and, if we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect that new services and technologies applicable to the electronic payments industry in which we compete will continue to emerge and evolve. Rapid and significant technological change continues to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in ecommerce, mobile commerce, and proximity payment devices. There is rapid innovation in the provision of other products and services to businesses, including in financial services and marketing services. With such rapid technological change, merchants will change their needs and non-traditional competitors may enter the market. We are subject to the risk that our existing products and services become obsolete, and that we are unable to develop new products and services in response to industry demands.\nThese new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and offer will achieve significant commercial acceptance. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payment card networks, laws and regulations, resistance to change from buyers or sellers, or third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nDeveloping new products and services carries the risks associated with any development effort, including difficulty in determining market demand and timing for delivery of new products and services, cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and market acceptance. Defects in our software and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential distribution partners and merchants, harm to our reputation, fines imposed by card networks, or exposure to liability claims. Any delay in the delivery of new products or services or the failure to differentiate our products and services could render them less desirable, or possibly even obsolete, to our merchants. Additionally, the market for alternative payment processing products and services is evolving, and it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new products and services.\nThe success of enhancements, new features, and products and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of the enhancements or new features or services. We often rely not only on our own initiatives and innovations, but also on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and\naccess to new technologies. Failure to accurately predict or to respond effectively to developments in our industry may significantly impair our business.\nIn addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, infrastructures, and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in mobile, software, communication, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our sellers or their customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments industry or expand into new markets, which would inhibit our growth and profitability.\nOur future growth and profitability depends, in part, upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate, the emergence of other markets for electronic payments and our ability to penetrate these markets and our current distribution partners\u2019 merchant base. Our future growth and profitability may depend upon our ability to penetrate new industries and markets for electronic payments.\nOur ability to expand into new industries and markets also depends upon our ability to adapt our existing technology or to develop new technologies to meet the particular needs of each new industry or market. We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services or distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new industries or markets. Penetrating these new industries or markets may also prove to be challenging and/or costly or take longer than we may anticipate. If we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments industries and markets, we may be unable to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.\nFurthermore, in response to market developments, we may expand into new geographical markets and foreign countries in which we do not currently have any operating experience. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand in such markets or internationally due to our lack of experience and the multitude of risks associated with global operations or lack of appropriate regulatory approval.\nIf we fail to manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nIn order to manage our growth effectively, we must continue to strengthen our existing infrastructure, develop and improve our internal controls, create and improve our reporting systems, and timely address issues as they arise. These efforts may require substantial financial expenditures, commitments of resources, developments of our processes, and other investments and innovations. As we grow, we may not be able to execute as quickly as a smaller, more efficient organization. If we do not successfully manage our growth, it may adversely impact our business.\nIf we cannot pass along increases in interchange and other fees from payment networks to our merchants, our operating margins decrease.\nWe pay interchange, assessment, transaction and other fees set by the payment networks to the card issuing financial institutions and the payment networks for each transaction we process. From time to time, the payment networks increase the interchange fees and other fees that they charge payment processors and the financial institution sponsors. At their sole discretion, our financial institution sponsors have the right to pass any increases in interchange and other fees on to us and they have consistently done so in the past. We are generally permitted under the contracts into which we enter, and in the past we have been able to, pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees. However, if we are unable to pass through these and other fees in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential changes in the competitive landscape, including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain, could harm our business.\nWe believe that the competitive landscape will continue to change and evolve, including in the following areas:\n\u2022\nRapid and significant changes in technology may result in technology-led marketing that is focused on business solutions rather than pricing, new and innovative payment methods and programs that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce the use of our services.\n\u2022\nCompetitors, distribution partners, and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace our value-added products and services.\n\u2022\nParticipants in the financial services payments and technology industries may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with us.\n\u2022\nNew services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industry-wide solutions and standards related to migration to EMV chip technology, tokenization or other security-related technologies\nFailure to compete effectively against any of these competitive threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology. Third parties may challenge, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of service offerings or other competitive harm. Others, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. Furthermore, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights and know-how, which is expensive and timely. In addition, such litigation could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, aspects of our business and our services rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to license or otherwise use third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe may also be subject to costly litigation if our services and technology are alleged to infringe upon or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, services or technology. Any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products, services or technology. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for patent, copyright or trademark infringement, breach of license or violation of other third-party intellectual property rights. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to such claims. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement or other violations and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. Claims of intellectual property infringement or violation also might require us to redesign affected products or services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or services. Even if we have an agreement for indemnification against such costs, the indemnifying party, if any in such circumstances, may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles of our merchants and distribution partners, and the overall level of consumer and commercial spending, each of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Electronic Payments industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, commercial, and government spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates could adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or aggregate dollar volume of transactions made using Electronic Payments. If our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using Electronic Payments, or consumers spend less money through Electronic Payments, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in less revenue. In addition, a weakening in the economy could have a negative impact on our merchants, as well as their customers who purchase products and services using our electronic payments services, which could, in turn, negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also have material fixed and\nsemi-fixed costs, including rent, debt service, contractual minimums and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy.\nA substantial portion of our merchants are small- and medium-sized businesses, which may increase the impact of economic fluctuations and merchant attrition on us.\nWe market and sell a substantial portion of our solutions to SMB merchants. SMB merchants are typically more susceptible to adverse effects of economic fluctuations than larger businesses. We experience attrition in merchants and merchant charge volume in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including business closures, transfers of merchants\u2019 accounts to our competitors, and account closures that we initiate due to heightened credit risks relating to, or contract breaches by, a merchant. Adverse changes in the economic environment or business failures of our SMB merchants may have a greater impact on us than on our competitors who do not focus on SMB merchants to the extent that we do. We cannot predict the level of SMB merchant attrition in the future. If we are unable to establish accounts with new merchants or otherwise increase our payment processing volume in order to counter the effect of this SMB attrition, our revenue will decline. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions fluctuate or deteriorate, the disproportionate impact on SMB merchants could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur systems and our third-party providers\u2019 systems may fail due to factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, resulting in our inability to process, cause us to lose business, increase our costs and expose us to liability.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of numerous systems, including our computer network systems, software, data centers and telecommunication networks, as well as the systems and services of our bank sponsors, the payment networks, third-party providers of processing services and other third parties. Our systems and operations or those of our third-party providers, such as our provider of dial-up authorization services, or the payment networks themselves, could be damaged or interrupted by, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, acts of terrorism, human error or sabotage, financial insolvency and similar events. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. Currently, our critical operational systems, such as our payment gateway, are fully redundant, while certain of our less critical systems are not. Accordingly, certain aspects of our operations may be subject to interruption. Also, while we have disaster recovery policies and arrangements in place, they have not been tested under actual disasters or similar events.\nDefects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in failure to process transactions, additional operating and development costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of revenue, merchants and distribution partners, loss of merchant and cardholder data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities and fines and other sanctions imposed by payment networks.\nOur products and services may not function as intended due to errors in our software, hardware, and systems, or due to security breaches or human error in administering these systems, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur software, hardware, and systems may contain undetected errors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly to the extent such errors are not detected and fixed quickly. In the past, we have found defects in our customer-facing software and hardware, internal systems, and technical integrations with third-party systems. New errors may be found in the future. In addition, we provide incremental releases of product and service updates and functional enhancements, which increase the possibility of errors. The electronic payments products and services we provide are designed to process complex transactions and deliver reports and other information related to those transactions, all at high volumes and processing speeds. Since customers use our services for important aspects of their businesses, any errors, defects, disruptions in services, or other performance problems with our services could damage our reputation as well as our customers\u2019 businesses. Software and system errors or human error could delay or inhibit settlement of payments, result in oversettlement of such payments, cause reporting errors, or prevent us from collecting transaction fees, all of which have occurred in the past. Security breaches or errors in our hardware or software design or manufacture could result in costly and time-consuming efforts to redesign and redistribute our products, give rise to regulatory inquiries and investigations, and result in lawsuits and other liabilities and losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on other service and technology providers. If they fail or discontinue providing their services or technology generally or to us specifically, our ability to provide services to merchants may be interrupted, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to provide or supplement Electronic Payment processing services and for infrastructure hosting services. We also rely on third parties for specific software and hardware used in providing our products and services. The termination by our service or technology providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with our merchants and, if we cannot find alternate providers quickly after such an event, it may cause those merchants to terminate their relationships with us.\nWe also rely in part on third parties for the development and access to new technologies, or updates to existing products and services for which third parties provide ongoing support. Failure by these third-party providers to devote an appropriate level of attention to our products and services could result in delays in introducing new products or services, or delays in resolving any issues with existing products or services for which third-party providers provide ongoing support.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income.\nWe have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenue as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically, due to seasonal retail sales, our revenues have been strongest in our third and fourth quarters, and weakest in our first quarter.\nFactors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include our ability to attract and retain new customers; the timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure, as well as the success of those expansions and upgrades; the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims; our ability to maintain or increase revenue, gross margins, and operating margins; our ability to continue introducing new services and products and to continue convincing customers to adopt additional offerings; increases in and timing of expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive; period to period volatility related to fraud and risk losses; system failures resulting in the inaccessibility of our products and services; changes in the regulatory environment, including with respect to security, privacy, or enforcement of laws and regulations by regulators, including fines, orders or consent decrees; changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions; unusual weather conditions; general retail buying patterns; and the other risks described in this Report.\nFraud by merchants or others could cause us to incur losses.\nWe face potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions initiated by merchants or others. Merchant fraud occurs when a merchant opens a fraudulent merchant account and conducts fraudulent transactions or when a merchant, rather than a customer (though sometimes working together with a customer engaged in fraudulent activities), knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit card or card number to record a false sales transaction, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Any time a merchant is unable to fund a chargeback, we are responsible for that chargeback.\nMerchant fraud also occurs when employees of merchants change the merchant demand deposit accounts to their personal bank account numbers, so that payments are improperly credited to the employee\u2019s personal account. We have established systems and procedures to detect and reduce the impact of merchant fraud, but we cannot be certain that such measures are or will be effective. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback and other liability.\nIn addition, we face potential liability for losses caused by fraudulent card-based payment transactions. Card fraud occurs when a merchant\u2019s customer uses a stolen card (or a stolen card number in a card-not-present transaction) to purchase merchandise or services. In a card-present transaction, if the merchant swipes the card, receives authorization for the transaction from the issuer and verifies the signature on the back of the card against the paper receipt signed by the customer, the issuer remains liable for any loss. In a card-not-present transaction, even if the merchant receives authorization for the transaction, the merchant is liable for any loss arising from the transaction. Many of the merchants that we serve transact a substantial percentage of their sales in card-not-present transactions over the Internet or in response to telephone or mail orders, which makes these merchants more vulnerable to fraud than merchants whose transactions are conducted largely in card-present transactions.\nWe rely on bank sponsors, which have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices, in order to process electronic payment transactions. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct our business.\nBecause we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in the Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks, and are, therefore, unable to directly access these payment networks, which are required to process transactions. These\nnetworks\u2019 operating regulations require us to be sponsored by a member bank in order to process Electronic Payment transactions. We are currently registered with Visa and MasterCard through Wells Fargo and Synovus Bank.\nThe current term of our agreement with Wells Fargo lasts through December 2021 and will thereafter automatically renew for two-year periods unless either party provides the other at least three months\u2019 notice of its intent to terminate. The current term of our agreement with Synovus Bank lasts through October 2020 and will thereafter automatically renew for two-year periods unless either party provides the other at least six months\u2019 notice of its intent to terminate.\nOur bank sponsors may terminate their agreements with us if we materially breach the agreements and do not cure the breach within an established cure period, if our membership with Visa and/or MasterCard terminates, if we enter bankruptcy or file for bankruptcy, or if applicable laws or regulations, including Visa and/or MasterCard regulations, change to prevent either the applicable bank or us from performing services under the agreement. If such sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure a replacement bank sponsor within the applicable wind down period, we will not be able to process electronic payment transactions.\nFurthermore, our agreements with our bank sponsors provide the bank sponsors with substantial discretion in approving certain elements of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and underwriting procedures for merchants. We cannot guarantee that our bank sponsors\u2019 actions under these agreements will not be detrimental to us, nor can we provide assurance that any of our bank sponsors will not terminate their sponsorship of us in the future. Our bank sponsors have broad discretion to impose new business or operational requirements on us, which may materially adversely affect our business. If our sponsorship agreements are terminated and we are unable to secure another bank sponsor, we will not be able to offer Visa or MasterCard transactions or settle transactions which would likely cause us to terminate our operations.\nOur bank sponsors also provide or supplement authorization, funding and settlement services in connection with our bankcard processing services. If our sponsorship agreements are terminated and we are unable to secure another bank sponsor, we will not be able to process Visa and MasterCard transactions which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers.\nWe have potential liability for chargebacks associated with the transactions we process. If a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant, the disputed transaction is \u201ccharged back\u201d to the merchant\u2019s bank and credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment. If we or our bank sponsors are unable to collect the chargeback from the merchant\u2019s account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable (due to bankruptcy or other reasons) to reimburse the merchant\u2019s bank for the chargeback, we may bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants would increase our costs and could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risks.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor, manage and remediate our risks. Some of our risk evaluation methods depend upon information provided by others and public information regarding markets, merchants or other matters that are otherwise inaccessible by us. In some cases, that information may not be accurate, complete or up-to-date. Additionally, our risk detection system is subject to a high degree of \u201cfalse positive\u201d risks being detected, which makes it difficult for us to identify real risks in a timely manner. If our policies and procedures are not effective, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that materially increase our costs and subject us to reputational damage that could limit our ability to grow and cause us to lose existing merchant clients.\nLegal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to commercial disputes and employee claims. From time to time, we may be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, could damage our reputation and have an adverse impact on our relationship with our merchants, distribution partners and other third parties. Such asserted claims could lead to additional related claims. Certain claims may seek injunctive relief, which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our cost of doing business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. In addition, regardless of merit\nor eventual outcome, such claims may still harm our reputation and cause us to expend significant resources in our defense. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in future litigation. If any judgments or settlements in any pending or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel or of our ability to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon the continued services of our senior management and other key employees who have substantial experience in the electronic payments industry and the markets in which we offer our services. In addition, our success depends in large part upon the reputation within the industry of our senior managers who have, developed relationships with our distribution partners, payment networks and other payment processing and service providers. Further, in order for us to continue to successfully compete and grow, we must attract, recruit, develop and retain personnel who will provide us with expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs.\nOur success also depends on the skill and experience of our sales force, which we must continuously work to maintain. While we have a number of key employees who have substantial experience with our operations, we must also develop our personnel to provide succession planning capable of maintaining the continuity of our operations. The market for qualified personnel is competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional employees. Accordingly, we may fail to effectively replace current employees who depart with qualified or effective successors.\nFailure to retain or attract key personnel could impede our ability to grow and could result in our inability to operate our business profitably. In addition, contractual obligations related to confidentiality, assignment of intellectual property rights, and non-solicitation may be ineffective or unenforceable and departing employees may share our proprietary information with competitors in ways that could adversely impact us, or seek to solicit our distribution partners or merchants or recruit our key personnel to competing businesses.\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional international, U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchants, could reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we do business. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the amount of revenue we receive, the value of any tax loss carry forwards, tax credits recorded on our balance sheet, and the amount of our cash flow. In addition, such tax changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Companies in the electronic payments industry, including us, may become subject to incremental taxation in various tax jurisdictions. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay additional taxes and are unable to pass the tax expense through to our merchants, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced.\nOur reported financial results may be materially and adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could materially and adversely affect the transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $138.0 million, consisting of amounts outstanding under the first lien facility (the \u201cFirst Lien Facility\u201d) and the second lien facility (the \u201cSecond Lien Facility\u201d) entered into in connection with the Merger.\nOur indebtedness may have important consequences to our investors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowings.\nPursuant to the credit agreements for the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility (together, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d), interest rates payable with respect to the First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility vary at stated margins above either LIBOR or BMO\u2019s base rate, which exposes us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, which may prevent us from growing our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, including developing new services and technologies, and to fund ongoing operating expenses. Also, we may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate if we are required to pay significant fines or settlements.\nTo the extent we raise additional funds using debt financing, such debt financing would increase our indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity and restrict our operations. We may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to remaining competitive in our industry could be significantly limited. This may prevent us from increasing our market share, capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The Credit Facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. Therefore, we may not be able to consummate dispositions or obtain the proceeds from them and, in any event, such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any relevant debt service obligations then due. Any alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our required debt service obligations.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default relating to our Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to accelerate payments due and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Consequently, we may not have sufficient assets to repay the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, as well as other secured and unsecured indebtedness.\nThe credit agreements for the Credit Facilities provide that upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders will be able to elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to lend additional funds. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders for the Credit Facilities could proceed to foreclose against the collateral we granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We pledged substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets as collateral for the Credit Facilities. If the lenders for the Credit Facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities, as well as any other secured and unsecured indebtedness, and if the lenders foreclose on our assets, it could render our common stock worthless.\nThe credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and the terms of our outstanding Preferred Stock contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to conduct business.\nThe credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and the terms of our Preferred Stock contain operating covenants and financial covenants that may in each case limit management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, change the nature of our business, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, make acquisitions, and merge or consolidate with other entities. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or other financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. In addition, credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and the terms of our Preferred Stock require that we maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet those tests. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Credit Facilities. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our Credit Facilities and our other liabilities, which may result in foreclosure on our assets and our common stock becoming worthless.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 57.3% of our total assets at December 31, 2016. These assets consist primarily of goodwill and customer relationship intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. Additional acquisitions would also result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets. Under current accounting standards, we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset, while goodwill is not amortized. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\nIf our business is not profitably operated, we may be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nWe will depend on profits generated by our business for distributions, debt repayment and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company, and to pay any dividends with respect to our capital stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in the credit agreements for the Credit Facilities and any future indebtedness, as well as our financial condition and operating requirements, may limit our ability to make distributions.\nProvisions in our charter and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new\nseries of preferred stock, which may increase the difficultly in removing management and discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company that is in the best interest of our stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to nominate directors for election to our board of directors and take other corporate actions.\nAn active trading market for our securities may not develop or continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the company and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never fully develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained.\nWe may be unable to continue to satisfy NASDAQ listing requirements in the future, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nWe may be unable to continue to meet the NASDAQ listing requirements for our common stock in the future. If we fail to meet such NASDAQ listing requirements and our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ, there could be significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the company; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to obtain capital or pursue acquisitions by issuing additional equity or convertible securities.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a publicly traded company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the NASDAQ, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Complying with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and costly, and we expect this to continue in the future. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, compliance with these requirements requires that our management and other personnel divert attention from operational and other business matters. Accordingly, these requirements require us to divert a significant amount of time and money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase our costs.\nThese expenses will increase further once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years from our initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d) or until such earlier time that we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. To the extent we choose not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, or if we no longer can be classified as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect that we will incur additional compliance costs, which will reduce our ability to operate profitably.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including not being required to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which we have elected to do.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for our common stock, our share price may be more volatile, and the price at which our securities trade could be less than if we did not use these exemptions.\nIf we do not develop and implement all required accounting practices and policies, we may be unable to provide the financial information required of a U.S. publicly traded company in a timely and reliable manner.\nWe expect that the implementation of all required accounting practices and policies and the hiring of additional financial staff will increase our operating costs and could require our management to devote significant time and resources to such implementation. If we fail to develop and maintain effective internal controls and procedures and disclosure controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide financial information and required SEC reports that are timely and reliable. Any such delays or deficiencies could harm us, including by limiting our ability to obtain financing, either in the public capital markets or from private sources and damaging our reputation, which in either cause could impede our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, any such delays or deficiencies could result in our failure to meet the requirements for continued listing of our common stock on NASDAQ.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities without stockholder approval, which would dilute our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interests in us and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness without shareholder approval in a number of circumstances.\nOur issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities could have one or more of the following effects:\n\u2022\nour existing shareholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of common stock may be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to repay indebtedness and to support our general corporate purposes. We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from CardConnect, LLC. The amounts available to us to pay cash dividends are also restricted by our Credit Facilities and the terms of our Preferred Stock, and, to the extent that we require additional financing, the sources of such additional financing may prohibit the payment of a dividend. As a result, appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, may be the only source of gain on an investment in our common stock.\nIf our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our securities may decline.\nIf our performance fails to meet market expectations, the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of our stockholders\u2019 investment. Even if an active market for our common stock exists, the market price of our common stock could be volatile and subject to wide\nfluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFactors affecting the market price of our common stock may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies\nperceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet market expectations in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the payments processing industry and market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany significant change in our board or management; any default on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency\nfluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may depress the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and NASDAQ have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for financial technology stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWarrants to purchase our common stock are currently exercisable, which could increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,300,000 shares of our common stock. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $12.00 per share. To the extent warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our 2016 Incentive Plan will dilute your stockholdings.\nThere are 4,796,296 of common stock reserved and authorized for issuance under our 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of 422 shares of common stock available for grant under\nthe 2016 Incentive Plan. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. Any common stock issued in connection with such incentive plan, the exercise of outstanding stock options, or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by all other stockholders.\nWe may be unable to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs permitted by Section 215.02 of the SEC\u2019s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, management is excluding its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is the year the Merger was completed, and we do not expect to have to include such assessment until the year ended December 31, 2017. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of a privately-held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we are unable to implement the additional requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report, a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 12, 2020, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Accordingly, until we cease being an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d stockholders will not have the benefit of an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our interest comfort environment.\nOur ability to meet expectations and projections in any research or reports published by securities or industry analysts, or a lack of coverage by securities or industry analysts, could result in a depressed market price and limited liquidity for our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover us, our stock price would likely be less than if we had more such coverage and the liquidity, or trading volume of our common stock may be limited, making it more difficult for a stockholder to sell shares at an acceptable price or amount. The projections of any analysts that do cover us may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of research analysts covering us. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our shareholders may reduce the market price of our common stock that shareholders might otherwise obtain\nAs of December 31, 2016, the FTS stockholders held an aggregate of 15,259,637 shares of our common stock with registration rights that were granted in connection with a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the FTS stockholders party thereto have certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued to them as partial consideration in the Merger, shares of common stock purchased in a private placement to partially finance the Merger, and\ncertain shares of unregistered common stock transferred to them in connection with the Merger. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable best efforts to consummate a secondary offering which will be a registered underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock held by any FTS stockholder that elects to participate in such offering (the \u201cFollow On Offering\u201d). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we have also agreed to file a registration statement to register any shares of our common stock held by the FTV Entities for resale (the \u201cFTV Shelf Registration Statement\u201d). If the FTV Shelf Registration Statement becomes unavailable at any time, the FTV Entities will have certain demand and piggyback registration rights.\nWe are also party to a registration rights agreement with certain of our stockholders entered into in February 2015 in connection with our initial public offering (the \u201cFounder Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). The stockholders party to the Founder Registration Rights Agreement have customary demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the 3,533,333 shares of unregistered common stock held by them.\nThe initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until certain threshold closing prices of our common stock have been exceeded. As of February 28, 2017, 2,240,000 shares of our common stock out of 3,533,333 total shares of our common stock held by the initial stockholders are no longer subject to such transfer restrictions. Additionally, 4,428,298 of the 15,259,637 shares of our common stock held by FTS stockholders that have registration rights can be sold at any time without needing the use of a registration statement\nUpon consummation of the Follow On Offering, effectiveness of the FTV Shelf, or exercise of registration rights under the Founder Registration Rights Agreement, these stockholders may sell large amounts of our stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The registration and availability of such a significant number of shares of common stock for trading in the public market may increase the volatility in our stock price or put significant downward pressure on the price of our stock.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may be forced to write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Although these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, reporting charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.", "PERMNO": 15292, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "CCN"}
