RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks actually occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Dialog Semiconductor plc could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn February 20, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Dialog and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will, pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the conditions specified in, the Merger Agreement, merge with and into us, and we will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and become a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Dialog. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock (subject to certain exceptions) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive $12.55 in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding.\nUncertainty about the effect of the proposed Merger on our employees, customers, partners and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business and operations that may be material to our company. Our employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. There can be no assurance we will be able to attract and retain key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract and retain employees. Any loss or distraction of such employees could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management attention and resources towards the completion of the Merger, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations. It is also possible that lawsuits related to the Merger may be filed against us and our Board of Directors, which could result in material and adverse effects on us, our business and the Merger. These or other related lawsuits could require management to devote significant time and resources in defense thereof.\nOur customers may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to concerns about possible changes to our products. Similarly, our partners and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Uncertainty may cause customers to refrain from purchasing our products, and partners and suppliers may seek to change existing business relationships, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and prospects in a way that may be material to our company.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, until the Merger becomes effective or the Merger Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and may result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may otherwise harm our business and operations.\nThe failure to complete the merger with Dialog could adversely affect our business.\nCompletion of the Merger with Dialog is subject to conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay, or otherwise adversely affect its completion in a material way. Such conditions include the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock, the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the completion of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, without the imposition of a \u201cburdensome condition\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d). If the Merger is not completed, the share price of our common stock may drop to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that a transaction will be completed. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that we will be required to pay Dialog a termination fee of $15.76 million in certain circumstances. Further, a failure to complete the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Any disruption to our business resulting from the announcement or pendency of the Merger or from intensifying competition from our competitors, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners, and suppliers, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failure to complete the Merger. There can be no assurance that our business, these relationships, or our financial condition will not be adversely affected, as compared to the condition prior to the announcement of the Merger, if the Merger is not consummated.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions, which could deter a third-party from proposing an alternative transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to the exceptions set forth in the next paragraph, limit our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish information in response to inquiries with respect to, an alternative transaction. It is possible that these or other provisions in the Merger Agreement might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our outstanding common stock from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire our common stock than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, however, Adesto has the right to engage in negotiations with, and provide information, to a third party that makes an unsolicited proposal that is received prior to the approval of the Merger by Adesto stockholders, if our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with our financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (a) such proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a superior offer and (b) failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its directors\u2019 fiduciary obligations under applicable Delaware law.\nWe will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe have and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger. A material portion of these expenses are payable by us whether or not the Merger is completed. Further, while we have assumed that a certain amount of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have a history of losses which may continue in the future, and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception. We incurred net losses of $26.9 million, $21.4 million, and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $147.9 million. We expect to incur significant expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including in connection with our efforts to pursue opportunities in emerging IoT markets, develop and improve upon our products and technology, maintain and enhance our research and development and sales and marketing activities and hire additional personnel. Further, revenue may not grow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, many of which are outside our control, including a decline in demand for our products, increased competition, business conditions that adversely affect the semiconductor industry, including reduced demand for products in the end markets that we serve, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture, package, assemble and test the semiconductor components comprising our products, which exposes us to a number of risks, including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery timing and potential exposure to price fluctuations, which could result in a loss of revenue or reduced profitability.\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we outsource the manufacturing, packaging, assembly and testing of our semiconductor components to, and rely on a limited number of, third-party foundries and assembly and testing service providers. For example, we use three foundries, United Microelectronics Corporation in Taiwan, and XMC and SMIC in China, for the production of our flash memory products and a single foundry, Altis Semiconductor S.N.C. in France (acquired by X-FAB Silicon Foundries in 2016), for our Mafraq and Moneta products. Our primary assembly and testing contractors are Amkor Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and Malaysia and Greatek Electronics in Taiwan. Our wafer probing is performed by King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. in Taiwan.\nRelying on third-party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ncapacity and materials shortages during periods of high demand;\n\u00b7\nreduced control over delivery schedules, inventories and quality;\n\u00b7\nthe unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to achieve required production or test capacity and acceptable yields on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nthe third parties\u2019 ability to perform their obligations due to bankruptcy or other financial constraints;\n\u00b7\nlimited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us;\n\u00b7\npotential increases in prices; and\n\u00b7\npotential manufacturing disruptions (including natural disasters or international health emergencies such as the recent coronavirus (or COVID-19)).\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with our third-party contract manufacturers for the products we sell to generate the bulk of our revenue, our NVM products, including United Microelectronics Corporation and Amkor Technology, Inc. Therefore, they are not obligated to perform services or supply components to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities, or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. During periods of high demand and tight inventories, our third-party foundries and assembly and testing contractors may allocate capacity to the production of other companies\u2019 components while reducing deliveries to us, or significantly raise their prices. In particular, they may allocate capacity to other customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long-term agreements, decreasing the capacity available to us. Shortages of capacity\navailable to us may be caused by the actions of their other, large customers that may be difficult to predict, such as major product launches. If we need other foundries or assembly and test contractors because of increased demand, or if we are unable to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers, we might not be able to cost-effectively and quickly retain other vendors to satisfy our requirements. Because the lead-time needed to establish a relationship with a new third-party supplier could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific component. In addition, the time and expense to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense, diversion of resources or lost sales, any of which would negatively impact our financial results.\nIn the event that we expand production of a component to include a new contract manufacturer, it may take approximately 18 to 24 months to allow a transition from our current foundry or assembly services provider to the new provider. We may experience difficulty migrating production to a new contract manufacturer and, consequently, may experience reduced yields, delays in component deliveries and increased research and development expense. The inability by us or our third-party manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition our technology to their infrastructure may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find suitable replacements for our third-party contract manufacturers.\nIf any of our current or future foundry partners or assembly and test subcontractors significantly increases the costs of wafers or other materials, interrupts or reduces our supply, including for reasons outside of their control, or if any of our relationships with our suppliers is terminated, our operating results could be adversely affected. During 2017, one of our foundry partners increased the costs of wafers to us. Although such increase did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact in the near term, there can be no assurances that any additional increases will not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results. Any increases could also damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue, cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation.\nOutbreak of health epidemics such as the COVID-19 may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries or regions where we, our customers or our suppliers operate or are considering operations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, manufacturing restrictions, declarations of national emergency and states of emergency, business shutdowns, cancellation of conference and industry trade shows and restrictions on the movement of employees in many regions of China and certain other countries, including the United States. The Mobile World Congress 2020, an industry trade show that is an important event for our customers and suppliers, was cancelled due to health concerns arising from COVID-19. Participation by our customers and suppliers in other industry trade show events such as Embedded World 2020 was significantly reduced due to health concerns arising from COVID-19, and other events have been postponed such as Light + Building 2020 due to similar health concerns. COVID-19, or similar or related diseases, may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our suppliers\u2019 supply to us and demand for our customers\u2019 products. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe may be unable to match production with customer demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to accurately forecast customer demand or the capacity constraints of contract manufacturers, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe make planning and spending decisions, including determining production levels, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of\nproduct demand and customer requirements. Our products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The short-term nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, necessitate more onerous procurement commitments and reduce our gross margin. If we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase products that we may not be able to sell, which could result in decreases in our prices or write-downs of unsold inventory. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity was unavailable, we would lose sales opportunities and could lose market share or damage our customer relationships. The rapid pace of innovation in our industry could also render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or write-downs of inventory values that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur quarterly operating results or other operating metrics may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We expect that this trend will continue as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\u00b7\nthe impact of our announced Merger with Dialog;\n\u00b7\nthe receipt, reduction, delay or cancellation of orders by large customers, a limited number of which we rely upon for a significant portion of our revenue;\n\u00b7\nthe gain or loss of significant customers and distributors;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and success of our launch of new or enhanced products and those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance of our products and our customers\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nthe level of growth or decline in the IoT market;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and extent of research and development and sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our product mix;\n\u00b7\nour ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in sales by and inventory levels of OEMs and ODMs who incorporate our products in their products;\n\u00b7\ncyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our markets;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third-party contract manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nevents that impact the availability of production capacity at our third-party subcontractors and other interruptions in the supply chain including due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, international health emergencies such as COVID-19, materials shortages, bankruptcy or other causes;\n\u00b7\nsupply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of expenses related to the acquisition and integration of technologies or businesses;\n\u00b7\nproduct rates of return or price concessions in excess of those expected or forecasted;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;\n\u00b7\nunexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with litigation over intellectual property rights and other litigation;\n\u00b7\nthe length and unpredictability of the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u00b7\nloss of key personnel or the inability to attract qualified engineers; and\n\u00b7\ngeopolitical events, such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions, the occurrence of natural disasters , or international health emergencies such as COVID-19.\nAny one of the factors above or other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or the cumulative effect of some of such factors may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our markets may experience significant cyclical fluctuations in demand as a result of changing economic conditions, budgeting and buying patterns of customers and other factors. As a result of these and other factors affecting demand for our products and our results of operations in any given period, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indicative of our future revenue or operating performance. Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results could also cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may experience difficulties in realizing the expected benefits of the acquisitions of S3 and Echelon and may continue to incur significant acquisition-related costs and transition costs in connection with these completed acquisitions.\nWe completed the acquisition of S3 on May 9, 2018, and the acquisition of Echelon on September 14, 2018. The integration of these businesses with ours has resulted in and continues to result in substantial financial costs and the investment of personnel time and attention and other resources. The success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies, and growth prospects from combining the respective companies with Adesto in an efficient and effective manner. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects and, we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. Our management cannot ensure that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term or at all.\nMoreover, risks specific to the acquired businesses and the sectors of the semiconductor market in which they compete could also delay or prevent our achievement of the expected benefits from the respective acquisition.\nThe market for semiconductor products is characterized by declines in average selling prices, which we expect to continue, and which could negatively affect our revenue and margins.\nOur customers expect the average selling price of our products to decrease year-over-year and we expect this trend to continue. When such pricing declines occur, we may not be able to mitigate the effects by selling more or higher margin units, or by reducing our manufacturing costs. In such circumstances, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our flash memory products have experienced declining average selling prices over their life cycle. The rate of decline may be affected by a number of factors, including relative supply and demand, the level of competition, production costs and technological changes. As a result of the decreasing average selling prices of our products following their launch, our ability to increase or maintain our margins depends on our ability to introduce new or enhanced products with higher average selling prices and to reduce our per-unit cost of sales and our operating costs. We may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities, and our costs may even increase because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, which could also reduce our gross margins. In addition, our new or enhanced products may not be as successful or enjoy as high margins as we expect. If we are unable to offset any reductions in average selling prices by introducing new products with higher average selling prices or reducing our costs, our revenue and margins will be negatively affected and may decrease.\nThe semiconductor market is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns in the past, generally as a result of wide fluctuations in supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, continuous new product introductions and price erosion. During downturns, periods of intense competition, or the presence of oversupply in the\nindustry, the selling prices for our products may decline at a high rate over relatively short time periods as compared to historical rates of decline. We are unable to predict selling prices for any future periods and may experience unanticipated, sharp declines in selling prices for our products.\nOur prospects for growth depend on the growth and development of the emerging IoT industry, and if the market does not develop as we expect, our business prospects may be harmed.\nOur products are increasingly being utilized in IoT edge devices. The IoT industry is nascent and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, devices and connectivity requirements, evolving industry standards and changing customer demands. The continued development of IoT depends in part on significant growth in the number of connected devices. Such growth is affected by various factors, including the continued growth in the use of mobile operator networks and the Internet to connect an increasing number and variety of devices, price reductions for key hardware and software components, innovation of other components of the IoT nodes toward low-power formats, and the continued development of IoT standards and protocols. Without these continued developments, IoT might not gain widespread market acceptance and our business could suffer. Security and privacy concerns, evolving business practices and consumer preferences may also slow the growth and development of IoT. Because our revenue growth ultimately depends upon the success of IoT, our business may suffer as a result of slowing or declining growth in IoT adoption. Even if the IoT industry does develop, we may not be well positioned or able to penetrate and capitalize on this new market. As a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain.\nThe markets for our products are evolving, and changing market conditions, such as the introduction of new technologies or changes in customer preferences, may negatively affect demand for our products. If we fail to properly anticipate or respond to changing market conditions, our business prospects and results of operations will suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to constant and rapid changes in technology, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, rapid product obsolescence and evolving technical standards. New technologies may be introduced that make the current technologies on which our products are based less competitive or obsolete or require us to make changes to our technology that could be expensive and time consuming to implement. Due to the evolving nature of our markets, our future success depends on our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to changes in industry standards, technological requirements, customer and consumer preferences and other market conditions. Our technologies could become obsolete sooner than we expect because of faster than anticipated, or unanticipated, changes in one or more of the industry standards and technological requirements. We may be unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced technologies that satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner or at all, succeed in commercializing the technologies on which we have focused our research and development expenditures to develop or otherwise made significant investments to acquire, and anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we may be unable to retain customers or attract new customers. Any decrease in demand for our products, or the need for low-power products in general, due to the emergence of competing technologies, changes in customer preferences and requirements or other factors, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe must continuously develop new and enhanced products, and if we are unable to successfully market our new and enhanced products for which we incur significant expenses to develop, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to compete effectively in our markets, we must continually design, develop and introduce new and improved products with improved features in a cost-effective manner in response to changing technologies and market demand. This requires us to devote substantial financial and other resources to research and development. We have developed and are continuing to develop next-generation products, such as our Moneta and EcoXiP products, which we expect to be one of the drivers of our future revenue growth. However, we may not succeed in developing and marketing these new and enhanced products. We also face the risk that customers may not value or be willing to bear the cost of\nincorporating our new and enhanced products into their products, particularly if they believe their customers are satisfied with current solutions. Regardless of the improved features or superior performance of our new and enhanced products, customers may be unwilling to adopt our solutions due to design or pricing constraints, or because they do not want to rely on a single or limited supply source. Because of the extensive time and resources that we invest in developing new and enhanced products, if we are unable to sell customers new generations of our products, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively affected. For example, we have generated limited revenue from sales of our Mavriq products to date. While we expect revenue from our Mavriq products to grow, we may not be able to materially increase our revenue from this product family. Similarly, any of our more recently-introduced products or product families, such as Moneta and EcoXiP, may not achieve market acceptance and contribute significantly to our revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop and market our new and enhanced products that we have incurred significant expenses developing, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success and future revenue depend on our ability to secure design wins and on our customers\u2019 ability to successfully sell the products that incorporate our solutions. Securing design wins is a lengthy, expensive and competitive process, and may not result in actual orders and sales, which could cause our revenue to decline.\nWe sell to customers that incorporate our products into their products. A design win occurs after a customer has tested our product, verified that it meets the customer\u2019s requirements, qualified our solutions for their products and placed an order for the purchase of our products. Our customers may need several months to years to test, evaluate and adopt our product and additional time to begin volume production of the product that incorporates our solution. Due to this generally lengthy design cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in our products to the time that we generate revenue from sales of these products. Moreover, even if a customer selects our solution, we cannot guarantee that this will result in any sales of our products, as the customer may ultimately change or cancel its product plans, or efforts by our customer to market and sell its product may not be successful. We may not generate any revenue from design wins after incurring the associated costs, which would cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nIf a current or prospective customer designs a competitor\u2019s solution into its product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our solutions to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant time, cost, effort and risk for the customer even if our solutions remain compatible with their product design. If current or prospective customers do not include our solutions in their products and we fail to achieve a sufficient number of design wins, our results of operations and business may be harmed.\nWe rely on our relationships with a limited number of OEMs and ODMs to enhance our solutions and market position, and our failure to continue to develop or maintain such relationships in the future would harm our ability to remain competitive.\nWe develop our products for a limited number of leading OEMs and ODMs that serve a variety of end markets and are developing devices for wearables, sensors, Bluetooth 4.0 and other IoT applications. For each application, manufacturers create products that incorporate specialized semiconductor technology, which makers of semiconductor products use as the basis for their products. These manufacturers set the specifications for many of the key components to be used on each generation of their products and, in the case of memory components, generally qualify only a few vendors to provide memory components for their products. As each new generation of their products is released, vendors are validated in a similar fashion. We must work closely with semiconductor manufacturers to ensure our products become qualified for use in their products. As a result, maintaining close relationships with leading product manufacturers that are developing devices for wearables, Bluetooth 4.0 and other IoT applications is crucial to the long-term success of our business. We could lose these relationships for a variety of reasons, including our failure to qualify as a vendor, our failure to demonstrate the value of our new solutions, declines in product quality, or if OEMs or ODMs seek to work with vendors with broader product suites, greater production capacity or greater financial resources. If our\nrelationships with key industry participants were to deteriorate or if our solutions were not qualified by our customers, our market position and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on selling through distributors.\nSales through distributors accounted for approximately 62% and 65% of our revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice.\nAny future adverse conditions in the U.S. or global economies or in the U.S. or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors. Any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation. In addition, during an industry or economic downturn, it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in demand for our products from our distributors, which could reduce our revenues in a given period. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar regulations, or similar laws, by our distributors could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanges to industry standards and technical requirements relevant to our products and markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur products are only a part of larger electronic systems. All products incorporated into these systems must comply with various industry standards and technical requirements created by regulatory bodies or industry participants in order to operate efficiently together. Industry standards and technical requirements in our markets are evolving and may change significantly over time. For our products, the industry standards are developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, an industry trade organization. In addition, large industry-leading semiconductor and electronics companies play a significant role in developing standards and technical requirements for the product ecosystems within which our products can be used. Our customers also may design certain specifications and other technical requirements specific to their products and solutions. These technical requirements may change as the customer introduces new or enhanced products and solutions.\nOur ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and comply with evolving industry standards and technical requirements. The emergence of new industry standards and technical requirements could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers or make it difficult for our products to meet the requirements of certain of our customers in consumer, industrial, IoT and other markets. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards and requirements. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards and technical requirements for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins, our revenue may decline and we may incur significant expenses to redesign our products to meet the relevant standards, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf sales of our customers\u2019 products decline or if their products do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur revenue depends on our customers\u2019 ability to commercialize their products successfully. The markets for our customers\u2019 products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. Competition in our customers\u2019 markets is based on a variety of factors including price, performance, product quality, marketing and distribution capability, customer support, name recognition and financial strength. As a result of rapid technological change, the markets for our customers\u2019 products are characterized by frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, fluctuating demand and increasing product capabilities. As a result, our customers\u2019 products may not achieve market success or may become obsolete. We cannot assure you that our customers will dedicate the resources necessary to promote and commercialize their products, successfully execute their business strategies for such products, or be able\nto manufacture such products in quantities sufficient to meet demand or cost-effectively manufacture products at a high volume. Our customers do not have contracts with us that require them to manufacture, distribute or sell any products. Moreover, our customers may develop internally, or in collaboration with our competitors, technology that they may utilize instead of the technology available to them through us. Our customers\u2019 failure to achieve market success for their products, including as a result of general declines in our customers\u2019 markets or industries, could negatively affect their willingness to utilize our products, which may result in a decrease in our revenue and negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur revenue also depends on the timely introduction, quality and market acceptance of our customers\u2019 products that incorporate our solutions. Our customers\u2019 products are often very complex and subject to design complexities that may result in design flaws, as well as potential defects, errors and bugs. We have in the past been subject to delays and project cancellations as a result of design flaws in the products developed by our customers. For example, in 2014, flaws in one of our customer\u2019s products that were unrelated to our solutions generated negative publicity for our customer and delayed the product\u2019s release until it could be redesigned. In the past, we have also been subject to delays and project cancellations as a result of changing market requirements, such as the customer adding a new feature, or because a customer\u2019s product fails their end customer\u2019s evaluation or field trial. Customer products may also be delayed due to issues with other vendors of theirs. We incur significant design and development costs in connection with designing our solutions for customers\u2019 products. If our customers discover design flaws, defects, errors or bugs in their products, or if they experience changing market requirements, failed evaluations or field trials, or issues with other vendors, they may delay, change or cancel a project. If we have already incurred significant development costs, we may not be able to recoup those costs, which in turn would adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe face competition and expect competition to increase in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our revenue growth and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe global semiconductor market in general, and the IoT semiconductor market in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as other semiconductor companies enter our markets, many of which have greater financial and other resources with which to pursue technology development, product design, manufacturing, marketing and sales and distribution of their products. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. Currently, our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products or systems to companies specializing in other alternative, specialized emerging memory technologies. Our primary competitors include GigaDevice Semiconductor, Macronix International Co. Ltd., Microchip Technology Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Winbond Electronics Corp ., Cree Inc., Digi International, General Electric, Maxim Integrated Products, Philips, Siemens, Silver Spring Networks, STMicroelectronics, Telensa, Texas Instruments, Tridium, On Semiconductor, Socionext, Ansem, IC Sense and Verisilicon. Key industry standard and trade group competitors include BACnet, DALI, DeviceNet, HART, Konnex, Profibus, ZigBee, and the ZWave Alliance in the IoT market. Each of these standards and/or alliances is backed by one or more competitors. In addition, as the IoT market opportunity grows, we expect new entrants will enter these markets and existing competitors, including leading semiconductor companies, may make significant investments to compete more effectively against our products. These competitors could develop technologies or architectures that make our products or technologies obsolete.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe functionality and performance of our products and those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour relationships with our customers and other industry participants;\n\u00b7\nprices of our products and prices of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop innovative products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain high-level talent, including our management team and engineers; and\n\u00b7\nthe actions of our competitors, including merger and acquisition activity, launches of new products and other actions that could change the competitive landscape.\nCompetition could result in pricing pressure, reduced revenue and profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. In the event of a market downturn, competition in the markets in which we operate may intensify as our customers reduce their purchase orders. Our competitors that are significantly larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources or more established market recognition than us may be better positioned to accept lower prices and withstand adverse economic or market conditions.\nOur customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, our business and operating results would suffer.\nPrior to selecting and purchasing our products, our customers typically require that our products undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our products in the customers\u2019 systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process may continue for several months or years. However, obtaining the requisite qualifications for a product does not assure any sales of the product. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision in our third-party contractors\u2019 manufacturing process or our selection of a new contract manufacturer may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified and selected, it can and often does take several months or more before the customer commences volume production of systems that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of those products may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and harm our business.\nOur costs may increase substantially if our third-party manufacturing contractors do not achieve satisfactory product yields or quality.\nThe fabrication process is extremely complicated and small changes in design, specifications or materials can result in material decreases in product yields or even the suspension of production. From time to time, the third-party foundries that we contract to manufacture our products may experience manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields related to errors or problems in their manufacturing processes or the interrelationship of their processes with our designs. In some cases, our third-party foundries may not be able to detect these defects early in the fabrication process or determine the cause of such defects in a timely manner.\nGenerally, in pricing our products, we assume that manufacturing yields will continue to improve, even as the complexity of our products increases. Once our products are initially qualified with our third-party foundries, minimum acceptable yields are established. We are responsible for the costs of the units if the actual yield is above the minimum. If actual yields are below the minimum we are not required to purchase the units. Typically, minimum acceptable yields for our new products are generally lower at first and gradually improve as we achieve full production. Unacceptably low product yields or other product manufacturing problems could substantially increase overall production time and costs and adversely impact our operating results. Product yield losses will increase our costs and reduce our gross margin. In addition to significantly harming our results of operations and cash flow, poor yields may delay shipment of our products and harm our relationships with existing and potential customers.\nThe complexity of our products may lead to errors, defects and bugs, which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability.\nProducts as complex as ours may contain errors, defects and bugs when first introduced to customers or as new versions are released. Our products have in the past experienced such errors, defects and bugs. Delivery of products with\nproduction defects or reliability, quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. Errors, defects or bugs could cause problems with the functionality of our products, resulting in interruptions, delays or cessation of sales of these products to our customers. We may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems. We cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products, both before and after commencement of commercial production, despite testing by us, our suppliers or our customers. Any such problems could result in:\n\u00b7\ndelays in development, manufacture and roll-out of new products;\n\u00b7\nadditional development costs;\n\u00b7\nloss of, or delays in, market acceptance;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts;\n\u00b7\nclaims for damages by our customers or others against us; and\n\u00b7\nloss of credibility with our current and prospective customers.\nAny such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our IoT solutions become subject to cyber-attacks, or if public perception is that they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, our reputation and business would suffer.\nWe have designed our IoT products, including our outdoor lighting solutions products acquired from Echelon, to interoperate with other third-party products and systems. Although we attempt to safeguard our products and solutions from cybersecurity threats, the potential for cyber security attacks and other incidents continues to evolve in scope and frequency.\nAdvances in and expanding availability of technical tools to enable cybersecurity attacks, and increasing sophistication of the threats, deepen the risk of potential security incidents. This risk expands as new protocols and devices are implemented into our products and systems, and as customer requirements evolve. Should our products, or the combination of our products into third party systems, fail to prevent or be unable to withstand any such threats or cyber-attacks, or if our partners or customers fail to safeguard applicable technologies, products or the systems with adequate security policies and measures or otherwise, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nWe have attempted to design certain of our products to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification or other activities related to those products and the systems into which the products are intended to be placed. Despite our security measures, our products or systems may be subject to unauthorized break ins, viruses, disruptions, high-jacking, cyber terrorism, misuse, tampering, other unauthorized access or modification, or unauthorized access to, or acquisition, loss, or alteration of, data. Should our products fail to perform, be unable to withstand a cyber-attack, or otherwise suffer a security incident, or be perceived to have suffered any kind of security vulnerability or cyber incidents, we could face legal liability, and encounter material adverse financial and reputational harm.\nIn addition, we believe that there could be incidents of security breaches in the future which could receive significant publicity and visibility. Any such publicity or visibility, regardless of whether the problem is due or related to the performance or security measures of our products or systems, could have a negative effect on public confidence, or cause a perception that our solutions are or could be subject to similar attacks or breaches, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, independent of the direct effects on our business.\nFurthermore, because some of the information collected by some of our solutions is or may be considered personal data or otherwise may be alleged to be confidential or proprietary to our customers or third parties, a cyber-attack or other data security incident, including any unauthorized access to, loss of, or acquisition of data collected or maintained by our solutions, could violate, or be alleged to violate, applicable privacy, consumer or information security laws, regulations or other obligations. Any of the foregoing could cause us to face regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, private litigation, and other financial or legal liability, as well as harm to our reputation and business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPersonal privacy, data protection and information security are significant issues in the United States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products and services. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies and various state, local and foreign bodies and agencies.\nThe United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including end-customers and employees. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including in Australia, the European Union (\"EU\"), India, Japan and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use personal information for certain purposes.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact of such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For example, in June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies effective in 2020. Additionally, we expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted differently in the future. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the regulatory framework for the future of personal data transfers from the EU to the United States with regulations such as the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which imposes more stringent EU data protection requirements, provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, including the adoption of the GDPR, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our products. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or\nsuspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may experience difficulties in transitioning to new wafer fabrication process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.\nWe aim to use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our solutions that is available from our third-party foundries. As a result, we periodically evaluate the benefits of migrating our solutions to other technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. These ongoing efforts require us from time to time to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products, which in turn may result in delays in product deliveries. We may face difficulties, delays and increased expense as we transition our products to new processes, and potentially to new foundries. We will depend on our third-party foundries as we transition to new processes. We cannot assure you that our third-party foundries will be able to effectively manage such transitions or that we will be able to maintain our relationship with our third-party foundries or develop relationships with new third-party foundries. If we or any of our third-party foundries experience significant delays in transitioning to new processes or fail to efficiently implement transitions, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, any of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our operating results.\nAs smaller line width geometry manufacturing processes become more prevalent, we intend to move our future products to increasingly smaller geometries in order to reduce costs while integrating greater levels of functionality into our products. This transition will require us and our third-party foundries to migrate to new designs and manufacturing processes for smaller geometry products. We may not be able to achieve smaller geometries with higher levels of design integration or to deliver new integrated products on a timely basis. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance. We are dependent on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our third-party foundries will be able to effectively manage any such transition. If we or our third-party foundries experience significant delays in any such transition or fail to implement a transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nIf we fail to retain qualified finance personnel and strengthen our financial reporting systems and infrastructure, we may not be able to timely and accurately report our financial results or comply with the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC reporting requirements.\nIf we remain an independent public company, our ability to timely and accurately report our financial results and comply with the requirements of being a public company depends on our maintaining adequate numbers of accounting and finance staff with technical accounting, Securities and Exchange Commission reporting and Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance expertise. Any inability to recruit or retain qualified accounting and finance staff would have an adverse impact on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements. We may be unable to hire qualified professionals with requisite technical and public company experience when and as needed, including following any significant acquisitions such as our acquisitions of S3 and Echelon in 2018, which increased the size of our operations and the requirements on our finance and accounting organization. In addition, new employees will require time and training to learn our business and operating processes and procedures. If our finance and accounting organization is unable for any reason to meet the demands of being a public company or increased requirements following any significant acquisitions, the quality and timeliness of our financial reporting may suffer, which could result in the identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls. Any consequences resulting from inaccuracies\nor delays in our reported financial statements could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to strengthen our financial reporting systems, infrastructure and internal control over financial reporting to meet the demands placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results timely and accurately and prevent fraud. We expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, particularly with respect to the requirement for an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm, which we expect to be required to comply with beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, if we remain an independent public company.\nA breach of our security systems may damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur security systems are designed to protect our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and employees\u2019 confidential information, as well as maintain the physical security of our facilities. We also rely on a number of third-party \u201ccloud-based\u201d service providers of corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and some finance functions, and we are, of necessity, dependent on the security systems of these third-party providers. Any security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to the systems of our cloud-based service providers or the existence of computer viruses in their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of confidential information. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our information systems or facilities, or the existence of computer viruses in our data or software, could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to us, our customers or our suppliers. Any theft or misuse of this information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of this information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, our reputation, and our relationships with our customers and partners. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, mask work protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how, in the United States and other jurisdictions. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate, particularly in foreign jurisdictions such as China. Any patents we hold may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights or our products against competitors and third parties may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our issued patents. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents or patent applications that we hold. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application, as we do not believe patent protection of these products and technologies is critical to our business strategy at this time. A failure to timely seek patent protection on products or technologies generally precludes us from seeking future patent protection on these products or technologies.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures designed to protect our trade secrets and know-how. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property or damages arising out of such contracts.\nWe may initiate claims against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. It could also result in the restructuring or loss of portions of our intellectual property, as an adverse decision could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially harm our business.\nWe may face claims of intellectual property infringement, which could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle, result in the loss of significant rights, harm our relationships with our customers and distributors, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by companies that hold patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. These companies include patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. From time to time, third parties may assert against us and our customers\u2019 patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.\nClaims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation, which could result in increased costs. Infringement claims also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\u00b7\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u00b7\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology, which may not be successful;\n\u00b7\nlicense technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7\ncross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages to our customers to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology, if available.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our exposure to the foregoing risks may also be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies or technologies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to the acquisition.\nWe rely upon third-party licensed technology to develop our products. If licenses of third-party technology are inadequate, our ability to develop and commercialize our products or product enhancements could be negatively impacted.\nOur products incorporate technology licensed from third parties. In connection with our acquisition of certain flash memory assets from Atmel Corporation (\"Atmel\") in 2012, we obtained a perpetual license to Atmel\u2019s flash memory technology. In addition, a component of our CBRAM technology is licensed from Axon Technologies\nCorporation. While we believe these licenses enable us to develop our products and pursue our current product strategies, these licenses may not provide us with the benefits we expect from them. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop our products or product enhancements. However, these third-party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology at a greater cost or of lower quality or performance standards or delay product development. Any of these results may limit our ability to develop new products, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have expanded in the past and expect to continue to expand in the future through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to stockholders or use resources that are necessary to operate our business,.\nWe have grown our business through acquisitions and, subject to Dialog\u2019s approval in accordance with the Merger Agreement, we may continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding potential strategic transactions. We completed the acquisition of S3 in May 2018 and the acquisition of Echelon in September 2018. These transactions are and any new acquisitions or investments could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating businesses and technology can create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures as could the integration of any future acquisitions. Such transactions could create risks for us, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired personnel, operations and technologies or realizing synergies expected in connection with an acquisition, particularly with acquisitions of companies with large and widespread operations, complex products or that operate in markets in which we historically have had limited experience;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs or liabilities, including possible litigation associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize expected revenue growth and higher than expected operating, transaction and integration costs;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u00b7\ninability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with end customers of newly acquired businesses and otherwise expand our sales channels;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u00b7\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate an acquisition.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in the use of substantial amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. We do not have an extensive history of acquiring other companies and managing integrations, and the risk of failing to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of our acquisitions of S3 and Echelon may be increased by the risks inherent to managing concurrent integrations. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize, may be less beneficial, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not receive the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions and investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected and our stock price could decline.\nIn our embedded systems business, we are increasingly dependent on third-party developers.\nWe are increasingly reliant on various third parties for the development of software used in our embedded systems products. There is a risk that the software provided by these third parties could contain errors or defects that could adversely impact the quality of our products. In addition, these third parties may use open source or other code that contains security flaws, which may cause our products to be more prone to hacking or other security incidents. We may\nalso be negatively impacted by employee turnover or other challenges that these third-party developers face in their own businesses. Third parties may also choose not to develop software for our products if we do not have adequate market share or sufficient perception of future success. The materialization of any of these risks would impact our ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis, which could adversely impact our reputation and brand and harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, many of these third-party developers are located in markets that are subject to political risk, intellectual property misappropriation, corruption, infrastructure problems, natural disasters and international health emergencies such as COVID-19, in addition to country specific privacy and data security risks, given current legal and regulatory environments. The failure of these third parties to meet their obligations and adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis and/or the development of significant disagreements, natural or man-made disasters or other factors that materially disrupt our ongoing relationship with these developers could negatively affect our operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategies.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain our key employees, including our management team and experienced engineers. Competition for personnel in the semiconductor technology field is intense, and the availability of suitable and qualified candidates is limited. We compete to attract and retain qualified research and development personnel with other semiconductor companies, universities and research institutions, particularly those in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located. The members of our management and key employees are at-will employees. In addition, our management and employees, including those recently added from S3 and Echelon, may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us as we integrate the acquired businesses into our existing organizational structure. We must continue to attract and motivate all our employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals following the acquisitions. If we lose the services of any key senior management member or employee, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, which could severely impact our business and prospects. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our key engineers, or our inability to attract and retain qualified engineers, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and we may need to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements of our growth, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe expect to increase headcount and the overall size of our operations to support our growth. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to expand our operational, engineering and financial systems, procedures and controls and to improve our accounting and other internal management systems if we remain an independent public company. This may require substantial managerial and financial resources, and our efforts in this regard may not be successful. Our current systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we fail to adequately manage our growth, or to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, or fail to effectively motivate or manage our new and future employees, the quality of our products and the management of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have operations outside of the United States and intend to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks.\nWith the acquisitions of S3 and Echelon, we expanded our global footprint beyond the limited operations we once had in Europe and Asia. We intend to further expand our operations in Asia. The success of our business depends, in large part, on our ability to operate successfully from geographically disparate locations and to further expand our international operations and sales. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those we face in the United\nStates. We cannot be sure that further international expansion will be successful. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could expose us to reduced demand for our products, lower prices for our products or other adverse effects on our operating results. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties, inefficiencies and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nlonger and more difficult customer qualification and credit checks;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u00b7\nthe need for various local approvals to operate in some countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in entering some foreign markets without larger-scale local operations;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with local laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including the elimination of tax holidays;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7\nadverse tax consequences as a result of repatriating cash generated from foreign operations to the United States;\n\u00b7\nadverse tax consequences, including potential additional tax exposure if we are deemed to have established a permanent establishment outside of the United States;\n\u00b7\nadverse tax consequences, including potential additional tax costs, resulting from the new tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, that imposes a minimum domestic tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar regulations;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers on the importation of our products;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the prices of our products to customers outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations by reducing the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk if, in the future, we denominate our international sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\nnew and different sources of competition; and\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, and terrorism.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our operations and reduce our revenue.\nBecause our business is highly dependent on growth in the electronics manufacturing supply chain in China, any slowdown in this growth could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the economy and the business environment in China, which has recently been adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, our growth strategy is based upon the assumption that demand in China for devices that use semiconductors will continue to grow. Therefore, any slowdown in the growth of consumer demand in China, including as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, for products that use semiconductors, such as computers, mobile phones or other consumer electronics, could have a serious adverse effect on our business. In addition, our business plan assumes that an increasing number of non-Chinese integrated device manufacturers, fabless semiconductor companies and systems companies will establish operations in China. That assumption may not prove to be correct as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, or other reasons. Any decline in the rate of migration to China of semiconductor design companies or companies that require semiconductors as components for their products could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSignificant tariffs or other restrictions on Chinese imports, and any related counter-measures taken by China, may materially harm our revenue and results of operations. In March 2018, the United States imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports and announced additional tariffs on goods imported from China specifically, as well as certain other countries. The materials subject to these tariffs to date do not constitute a significant percentage of our raw material costs. However, if retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in\nresponse to the tariffs cause the cost of our products to increase, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm to our operating performance and reputation.\nIn order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we may need to modify our activities or incur substantial costs, and if we fail to comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or be required to have our suppliers alter their processes.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local governmental regulations directed at preventing or mitigating environmental harm, as well as to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage or personal injury claims. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our business or require us to modify processes or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business. In response to environmental concerns, some customers and government agencies impose requirements for the elimination of hazardous substances, such as lead (which is widely used in soldering connections in the process of semiconductor packaging and assembly), from electronic equipment. For example, the EU adopted its Restriction on Hazardous Substance Directive which prohibits, with specified exceptions, the sale in the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead or other hazardous materials and China has enacted similar regulations. Environmental laws and regulations such as these could become more stringent over time, causing a need to redesign technologies, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could seriously harm our business.\nThe issuance of new accounting standards or future interpretations of existing accounting standards could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). A change in those principles could have a significant effect on our reported results and might affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. GAAP is issued and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. The issuance of new accounting standards or future interpretations of existing accounting standards, or changes in our business practices or estimates, could result in future changes in our revenue recognition or other accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which will require significant interest payments. We have approximately $80.5 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2019, representing the 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (\u201cNotes\u201d) we issued in September 2019. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the Notes, which will reduce funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u00b7\nwe will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nour leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions;\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to the economic downturns and adverse developments in our business;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation; and\n\u00b7\nin the event of the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our business, if there are not sufficient assets remaining to pay all creditors, then all or a portion of the amounts due on the Notes then outstanding would remain unpaid.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our existing credit facility and the terms of any of our other indebtedness. For example, we may incur additional debt to fund our business and strategic initiatives. If we incur additional debt and other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase.\nOur ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt arrangements and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt arrangements depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Accordingly, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nWe have funded our operations since inception through equity financings, our borrowing arrangements, our public offerings of common stock in October 2015, June 2017, and July 2018, and issuance of the Notes. We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception, and we expect we will continue to incur operating and net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital to fund our ongoing operations, respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities, but we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing or raise additional capital in the public market on favorable terms or at all.\nOur current credit facility limits our ability to incur indebtedness, and these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions subject to the consent of our lender. Any additional debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nIf we raise additional funds through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cthe Code\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and certain other tax credit carryforwards (including research credit carryforwards) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes. The Company does not expect to undergo an ownership change (other than the ownership change that will result from the closing of the Merger). The potential change in our stock ownership that would result from the closing of the merger could constitute an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code and could cause our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credits to be further limited. Our NOLs and tax credits could also be impaired under state laws. As a result of the foregoing limitations, we might not be able to utilize a material portion of our federal and/or state NOLs and tax credits.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, should we remain an independent public company, we expect that we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an attestation report regarding management\u2019s report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2019, we had a net total of $67.7 million of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIn connection with our ongoing operations, additional insight could be gained that may impact: (1) identified intangible assets; (2) the estimated total value assigned to intangible assets; and (3) the estimated useful life of each category of intangible assets. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or intangible assets. Any such material charges may have a material negative impact on our operating results.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely\naffect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our products, and affect our costs and relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers as we must obtain additional information from them to ensure our compliance with the disclosure requirement. In addition, we incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and these customers may discontinue, or materially reduce, purchases of our products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSome of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities, which could cause us to curtail our operations.\nOur principal offices, and our contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 facilities in Asia, are located near known earthquake fault zones and, therefore, are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods and similar events. If any such disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in October 2015 at a price of $5.00 per share, our stock price has fluctuated significantly. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe impact of our announced Merger with Dialog;\n\u00b7\noverall performance of the equity markets in general, in our industry or in the markets we address;\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the estimates of our results of operations that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projected results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or enhancements to products, acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new business partners, on the termination of existing business partner arrangements or changes to our relationships with such business partners;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of litigation or claims against us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in legal requirements relating to our business;\n\u00b7\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers and end customers\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters or international health emergencies such as COVID-19;\n\u00b7\ntrading activity by our principal stockholders;\n\u00b7\nany further issuances of securities, including by conversion of the Notes in certain circumstances;\n\u00b7\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements; and\n\u00b7\nsales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the market price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If few analysts cover our company, the price and trading volume of our stock could suffer. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, from February 20, 2020 until the effective time of the Merger, we may not declare any dividend or make any other distribution in respect of any shares of capital stock without Dialog\u2019s prior written consent. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is likely to be restricted by any future debt financing arrangement. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to increases in the price of our common stock, if any.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management.\nDelaware corporate law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our board of directors that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u00b7\nprovide that directors may be removed only \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of stockholders representing sixty-six percent (66%) of our outstanding common stock;\n\u00b7\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means that all stockholder actions will be required to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to the Notes\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nShould we remain an independent public company, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the maturity date, such as the Merger, at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, should we remain an independent public company, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the Notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or any agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash upon conversions of Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, including as a result of the Merger, holders of notes will be entitled to convert their notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more\nholders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results should we remain an independent public company.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at issuance, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report larger net losses or lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted net income per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nIn July 2019, the FASB issued an exposure draft that proposes to change the accounting for the convertible debt instruments described above. Under the exposure draft, an entity may no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This could have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income or decreasing net loss. Additionally, as currently proposed, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Rather, the if-converted method may be required, which would increase the total number of potential dilutive common shares and could decrease our diluted weighted-average earnings per share. We cannot be sure that this exposure draft will be issued, or will be issued in its current format. We also cannot be sure whether other changes may be made to the current accounting standards related to the Notes, or otherwise, that could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the Notes.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, from February 20, 2020 until the effective time of the Merger, we generally may not sell, issue, grant or authorize the sale, issuance or grant of any shares of our common stock or other security, or any option, performance stock unit, restricted stock award or other equity-based compensation award, or right to acquire any capital stock or other security; or any instrument convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other security, other than the issuance of shares upon the valid exercise of outstanding options, or the vesting or scheduled settlement of other outstanding equity awards or outstanding warrants, or the conversion of the Notes, in each case in accordance with their terms.\nWe may sell additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities to raise capital, however, should we remain an independent public company. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon conversion of the Notes, which, as noted in the paragraph above, are issuable pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.\nProvisions in the indenture for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to holders of the Notes or our stockholders.\nIf a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, such as the Merger, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior the maturity date, such as the Merger, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes will prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes, which we expect to occur in connection with the closing of the Merger. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the Notes or our stockholders.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with Credit Suisse Capital LLC and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, or the option counterparties. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that was initially underlie the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock as a result of any conversion of the Notes.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased/will purchase shares of our common stock and/or entered/will enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time.\nIn addition, should we remain an independent public company, we expect the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity date (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call\ntransactions, which are expected to occur during each 30 trading day period beginning on the 31st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the Notes, or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or conversion of the Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the holder of the Notes\u2019 ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that the holder of the Notes will receive upon conversion of the Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock, should we remain an independent public company, or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Notes (and as a result, the amount and value of the consideration that the holder of the Notes would receive upon the conversion of any notes) and, under certain circumstances, the holder of the Notes\u2019 ability to convert the notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe option counterparties to the capped call transactions we have entered into are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If an option counterparty to one or more capped call transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases, should we remain an independent public company. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock, should we remain an independent public company. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.", "PERMNO": 15786, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "IOTS"}
