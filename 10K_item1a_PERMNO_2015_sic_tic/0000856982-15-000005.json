Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results will vary, and may vary materially, from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on our business, operations or financial condition are the factors identified below:\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology or our technology may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nWe have obtained U.S. and foreign patents and filed applications for additional U.S. and foreign patents; however, there can be no assurance that any patents we hold, or for which we have applied, will provide us with any significant competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge our patents, or that patents owned by others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. We could incur substantial costs in preventing patent infringement, in curbing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by others, or in defending against similar claims of others. Since we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to maintain our competitive position, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar or superior technologies.\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive medical technology marketplace. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry and we have been involved in litigation proceedings related to our intellectual property rights. Our activities have required, and may in the future, require us to defend against claims and actions alleging infringement of the intellectual rights of others. If a court rules against us in any patent litigation, any of several negative outcomes could occur: we could be subject to significant liabilities, we could be forced to seek licenses from third parties, or we could be prevented from marketing certain products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in litigation, regulatory proceedings or other disputes. The outcomes of litigation are difficult to predict or quantify; however, an adverse outcome could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our operating margin on the sale of our products. The expense of defending litigation may be costly and the demands of litigation would divert our management's attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows. Intellectual property infringement or other claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not presently known to our management. Because we are self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims, a significant claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur ability to remain competitive is dependent, in part, upon our ability to prevent other companies from using our proprietary technology incorporated into our products. We seek to protect our technology through a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as licenses, proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements. We may be unable, however, to prevent others from using our proprietary information, or may be unable to continue to use such information for our own purposes, for numerous reasons, including the following, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial condition:\n\u2022\nOur issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from copying our proprietary technology.\n\u2022\nOur issued patents may be challenged by third parties and deemed to be overbroad or unenforceable.\n\u2022\nOur products may infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of other parties, requiring us to alter or discontinue our manufacture or sale of such products.\n\u2022\nCosts associated with seeking enforcement of our patents against infringement or defending our activities against allegations of infringement, may be significant.\n\u2022\nOur pending patent applications may not be granted for various reasons, including over breadth or conflict with an existing patent.\n\u2022\nOther persons or entities may independently develop, or have developed, similar or superior technologies.\n\u2022\nAll of our patents will eventually expire and some of our patents, including patents protecting significant elements of our technology, will expire within the next several years.\nOur products may be subject to product liability claims.\nOur products are used in connection with invasive procedures and in other medical contexts that entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. If medical personnel or their patients suffer injury in connection with the use of our products, whether as a result of a failure of our products to function as designed, an inappropriate design, inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information, improper use, or for any other reason, we could be subject to lawsuits seeking significant compensatory and punitive damages. We have previously faced claims by patients claiming injuries from our products. To date, these claims have not resulted in a material negative impact on our operations or financial condition; however, patients or customers may bring claims in a number of circumstances, including if our products were misused, if our products' manufacture or design was flawed, if our products produced unsatisfactory results, or if the instructions for use and other disclosure of product-related risks for our products were found to be inadequate. The outcome of this type of personal injury litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. We maintain product liability insurance; however, there is no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us. Moreover, any product liability claim brought against us could result in significant costs, could increase our product liability insurance rates, or could prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. As a result, any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, the occurrence of such an event or claim could result in a recall of products from the market or a safety alert relating to such products. Such a recall could result in significant costs and could divert management's attention from our business.\nWe generally offer a limited warranty for product returns which are due to defects in quality and workmanship. We attempt to estimate our potential liability for future product returns and establish reserves on our financial statements in amounts that we believe will be sufficient to address our warranty obligations; however, our actual liability for product returns may significantly exceed the amount of our reserves. If we underestimate our potential liability for future product returns, or if unanticipated events result in returns that exceed our historical experience, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.\nWe entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated December 19, 2012, with the lenders who are or may become party thereto (collectively, the \u201cLenders\u201d) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent for the Lenders, which was amended on October 4, 2013 by a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement contains a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity or our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens or pledges on our assets, mergers or similar combinations or liquidations, asset dispositions, repurchases or redemptions of equity interests or debt, issuances of equity, payment of dividends and certain distributions, and entry into related party transactions.\nOur breach of any covenant in the Credit Agreement, not otherwise cured, waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations. Any default under the Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nA significant adverse change in, or failure to comply with, governing regulations could adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition.\nSubstantially all of our products are \u201cdevices,\u201d as defined in the FDCA, and the manufacture, distribution, record keeping, labeling and advertisement of substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in various foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed, labeled, offered or sold. Further, we are subject to regular review and periodic inspections at our facilities with respect to compliance with the FDCA, QSR and similar requirements of foreign countries. Some physicians may be using our products in procedures that are not included in the clearance or approval of the products. If the FDA or any other foreign, federal or state enforcement agency were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or have improperly promoted our products for uncleared or unapproved indications, the FDA or such other agency could require a recall of products or allege that our promotional activities misbrand or adulterate our products or violate other legal requirements, which could result in investigations, prosecutions, or other civil or criminal actions.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain export control restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and may be subject to regulations administered by other regulatory agencies in various foreign countries to which our products are exported. Although we believe we are currently in material compliance with these requirements, any failure on our part to comply with all applicable current and future regulations could adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition.\nInternational and national economic and industry conditions constantly change, and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business and our results of operation are affected by many changing economic, industry and other conditions beyond our control. Actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession and inflation and trade protection measures, may negatively affect consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends, any of which could adversely affect our business or results of operations. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase or pay for our products. Disruptions in the credit markets have previously resulted, and could again result, in volatility, decreased liquidity, widening of credit spreads, and reduced availability of financing. There can be no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain necessary additional financing on acceptable terms may have an adverse impact on us and on our ability to implement our business plan.\nThe medical device industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities.\nOur medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and international governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny over the medical device industry. In recent years, the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense have issued subpoenas and other requests for information to medical device manufacturers, primarily related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices. We anticipate that government authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by government authorities may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.\nTermination or interruption of relationships with our suppliers, or failure of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt our business.\nWe rely on raw materials, component parts, finished products and third-party services in connection with our business. For example, substantially all of our products are sterilized by only a few different entities. In addition, some of our products are manufactured or assembled by third parties. If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts, finished goods or services were to terminate its relationship with us, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, finished goods or services consistent with past practice, our ability to meet our obligations to our customers may be disrupted. A disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe will be required to expend significant resources for research, development, testing and regulatory approval or clearance of our products under development and these products may not be developed successfully or approved for commercial use.\nMost of our products under development will require significant additional research, development, engineering and preclinical and/or clinical testing, as well as regulatory approval or clearance and a commitment of significant additional resources prior to their commercialization. It is possible that they may not: be developed successfully; be proven safe or effective in clinical trials; offer therapeutic or other improvements over current treatments and products; meet applicable regulatory standards or receive regulatory approvals or clearances; be capable of production in commercial quantities at acceptable costs and in compliance with regulatory requirements; be successfully marketed; or be covered by private or public insurers.\nWe are currently conducting three clinical trials in an effort to obtain approval from the FDA that would enable us to expand our efforts to commercialize the QuadraSphere Microspheres, Embosphere Microspheres and EndoMAXX EVT Valved Esophageal Stent. European Union regulations do not currently require such applications for these classes of medical device. In order for us to obtain FDA approval or clearance to promote the use of QuadraSphere Microspheres, Embosphere Microspheres and EndoMAXX EVT Valved Esophageal Stent for the purposes indicated in our clinical trials, we will need to complete those trials and submit positive clinical data to the FDA. If we cannot enroll study subjects in sufficient numbers to complete the necessary studies, if there is a disruption in the supply of materials for the trials or if any other factors preclude us from completing the trials in a timely manner we will likely not be able to complete those trials. Even if we complete the three clinical trials, the FDA may require us to undertake additional testing, or the trial results may not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval or clearance for other reasons. If we do not obtain FDA approval or clearance of the product use claimed in a clinical trial, we will not be able to promote the subject product for the indicated treatment of the specific disease or condition in the United States.\nWe are subject to laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, the violation of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nOur operations are subject to various state and federal laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other anti-kickback laws, which prohibit any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for an item or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of these fraud and abuse-related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect our business or financial results. Jurisdictions outside the United States may also have laws, including anti-bribery statutes, prohibiting similar conduct and providing for significant penalties.\nIf our employees or agents violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, we may incur fines or penalties, or experience other adverse consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from illegally offering things of value to any individual for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. As we continue to expand our business activities internationally, compliance with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws presents greater challenges to our operations. If our employees or agents violate the provisions of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws, we may incur fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nHealthcare reform legislation has negatively affected our financial results and may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nThe PPACA was enacted into law in March 2010, and most of the core pieces of the PPACA are now in effect. Certain other provisions of the legislation are not scheduled to become effective for a number of years. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact of the legislation will be. The law imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we incurred $3.5 million related to this tax, which reduced our gross profit by 0.7%. In addition, the costs of compliance with the PPACA\u2019s new reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare providers may have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As we cannot ultimately predict the long-term effect of the PPACA provisions as they are implemented, any changes to healthcare reform that lower reimbursement amounts for our products could adversely affect our revenues, results of operation or financial condition.\nLimits on reimbursement imposed by governmental and other programs may adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nThe cost of a significant portion of medical care is funded by governmental, and other third-party insurance programs. Limits on reimbursement imposed by such programs may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and others to purchase our products. In addition, limitations on reimbursement for procedures which utilize our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results.\nAs our operations have grown outside the United States, we have also become subject to market risk relating to foreign currency. Those fluctuations could have a negative impact on our margins and financial results. For example, during 2014, the exchange rate between all applicable foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar resulted in an increase in our gross revenues of approximately $501,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $98.6 million, or 19%, of our sales, were denominated in foreign currencies. If the rate of exchange between foreign currencies decline against the U.S. Dollar, we may not be able to increase the prices we charge our customers for products whose prices are denominated in those respective foreign currencies. Furthermore, we may be unable or elect not to enter into hedging transactions which could mitigate the effect of declining exchange rates. As\na result, if the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. Dollar, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nIncreases in the price of commodity components, particularly petroleum-based products, or loss of supply could have an adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our products have components that are manufactured using resins, plastics and other petroleum-based materials. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in large part, on the availability and pricing of these materials. The availability of these products is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including political uncertainty in the Middle East, and there is no assurance that crude oil supplies will not be interrupted in the future. Any such interruption could have an adverse effect on our ability to produce, or on the cost to produce, our products. Also, crude oil prices generally fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel-related transportation costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and political uncertainty in the Middle East. Our suppliers may pass some of their cost increases on to us, and if such increased costs are sustained or increase further, our suppliers may pass further cost increases on to us. In addition to the effect on resin prices, transportation costs generally increase based on the effect of higher crude oil prices, and these increased transportation costs may be passed on to us. Our ability to recover such increased costs may depend upon our ability to raise prices on our products. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost-containment efforts of our customers and third-party payors, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully manage growth, particularly if accomplished through acquisitions.\nSuccessful implementation of our business strategy will require that we effectively manage any associated growth. To manage growth effectively, our management will need to continue to implement changes in certain aspects of our business, to improve our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand, to attract and retain qualified personnel, and to develop, train, and manage an increasing number of management-level and other employees. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management, financial, product design, marketing, distribution and other resources, and we could experience operating difficulties. Any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nOver the past several years, we completed a series of significant acquisitions, including our acquisition of BioSphere and Thomas Medical. As we grow through acquisitions, we face the additional challenges of integrating the operations, culture, information management systems and other characteristics of the acquired entity with our own. We have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, significant expenses in connection with negotiating and consummating various acquisition transactions, and we may inherit significant liabilities in connection with prospective acquisitions. In addition, we may not realize competitive advantages, synergies or other benefits anticipated in connection with any such acquisition. If we do not adequately identify targets for, or manage issues related to, our future acquisitions, such acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.\nWe are dependent on our cash on hand and free cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. Our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service or repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from a few products, procedures and/or customers.\nA significant portion of our revenues is attributable to sales of our inflation devices. During the year ended December 31, 2014, sales of our inflation devices (including inflation devices sold in custom kits and through OEM channels) accounted for approximately 14% of our total revenues. Any material decline in market demand, or change in OEM supplier preference, for our inflation devices could have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, the products that have accounted for a majority of our historical revenues are designed for use in connection with a few related medical procedures, including angioplasty, stent placement procedures, and spinal procedures. If subsequent developments in medical technology or drug therapy make such procedures obsolete, or alter the methodology of such procedures\nso as to eliminate the usefulness of our products, we may experience a material decrease in demand for our products and experience deteriorating financial performance.\nWe may be unable to compete in our markets, particularly if there is a significant change in relevant practices or technology.\nThe markets in which our products compete are highly competitive. We face competition from many companies which are larger, better established, have greater financial, technical and other resources and possess a greater market presence than we do. Such resources and market presence may enable our competition to more effectively market competing products or to market competing products at reduced prices in order to gain market share.\nIn addition, our ability to compete successfully is dependent, in part, upon our response to changes in technology and upon our efforts to develop and market new products which achieve significant market acceptance. Competing companies with substantially greater resources than us are actively engaged in research and development of new methods, treatments, drugs, and procedures to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease that could limit the market for our products and eventually make some of our products obsolete. A reduction in the demand for a significant number of our products, or a few key products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has at times been, and may in the future be, volatile for various reasons, including those discussed in these risks factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. Other events that could cause volatility in our stock, include without limitation, quarter-to-quarter variances in our financial results; analysts\u2019 and other projections or recommendations regarding our Common Stock specifically or medical technology stocks generally; any restatement of our financial statements or any investigation of us by the SEC, the FDA or another regulatory authority; or a decline, or rise, of stock prices in the capital markets generally.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. If we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could, among other things, lose customers, have difficulty preventing fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, other health care professionals and other employees, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel.\nOur success is dependent on key management personnel, including Fred P. Lampropoulos, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lampropoulos is not subject to any agreement prohibiting his departure, and we do not maintain key man life insurance on his life. The loss of Mr. Lampropoulos, or of certain other key management personnel, could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations. Our success also depends on, among other factors, the successful recruitment and retention of key operating, manufacturing, sales and other personnel.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly\ndifferent from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nWe are subject to work stoppage, transportation and related risks.\nWe manufacture products at various locations in the United States and foreign countries and sell our products worldwide. We depend on third-party transportation companies to deliver supplies necessary to manufacture our products from vendors to our various facilities and to move our products to customers, operating divisions, and other subsidiaries located worldwide. Our manufacturing operations, and the operations of the transportation companies on which we depend, may be adversely affected by natural disasters or significant human events, such as a war, terrorist attack, riot, strike, slowdown or similar event. Any disruption in our manufacturing or transportation could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands or our operations.\nOur failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could affect our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe manufacture and assemble certain products that require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to various national, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety. While the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically, compliance with future regulations may require additional capital investments. Additionally, because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes, we are subject to certain risks of future liabilities, lawsuits and claims resulting from any substances we manufacture, dispose of or release. Any accidental release may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations, capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition, and could require substantial expenditures.\nOperations at our manufacturing facilities may be negatively impacted by certain factors, including severe weather conditions and natural disasters.\nOur operations could be affected by many factors beyond our control, including severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes and tornadoes. These conditions could cause substantial damage to our facilities, interrupt our production and disrupt our ability to deliver products to our customers.", "PERMNO": 76392, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "MMSI"}
