Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Related to our NobelClad Segment\nNobelClad\u2019s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals.\nNobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad\u2019s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years due in part to a low-metals price environment. If demand or metals prices do not increase or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.\nWe use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $37.5 million, $31.6 million, and $41.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We define \u201cbacklog\u201d at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon.\nThere is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.\nOur cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines. We plan to discontinue our Tautavel shooting site late in 2018, and move all shooting operations in Europe to Dillenburg. This will increase the demands on the Dillenburg mine. If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site in a timely manner to continue our operations. In addition, our primary U.S. shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.\nOur explosion-welded clad products compete with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business located throughout the world and with clad products manufactured using other technologies. Our combined North American and European operations typically supply explosion-welded clad to the worldwide market. There is one other well-known explosion-welded clad supplier worldwide - a division of Asahi-Kasei Corporation of Japan. There are also a number of smaller companies worldwide with explosion-welded clad manufacturing capability, including several companies in China that appear to be growing significantly in their domestic markets. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with those manufactured by rollbond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.\nThe use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations involve the detonation of large amounts of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. As a result, we are required to use specific safety precautions under U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and guidelines of similar entities in Germany and France. These include precautions which must be tak\nen to protect employees from exposure to sound and ground vibration or falling debris associated with the detonation of explosives. There is a risk that an accident or death could occur in one of our facilities.\nExplosions, even if occurring as intended, can lead to damage to the shooting site or manufacturing facility or to equipment used at the facility or injury or death to persons at the facility. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses. To date, we have not incurred any significant delays, disruptions or claims resulting from accidents at our facilities. If an accident occurred, we might be required to suspend our operations for a period of time while an investigation is undertaken or repairs are made. Such a delay might impact our ability to meet the demand for our products.\nCustomers have the right to change orders until products are completed.\nCustomers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed.\nRisk Factors Related to DynaEnergetics\nDemand for DynaEnergetics\u2019 products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreased oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. From 2014 through mid-2017, oil and gas prices declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry during this period. As a result, many of our customers reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our products and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charged and the revenues and profits we earned during this period. This resulted in DynaEnergetics\u2019 revenues in 2016 being 36.2% less than in 2014 and in 2015 being 27.0% less than in 2014. Although we have seen increased oil and gas prices and increased exploration and production spending in 2017, resulting in increased revenues for DynaEnergetics, there is no assurance that such conditions will continue.\nThere can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will continue at current levels or follow historic patterns. A decline in oil and gas prices could cause reductions in cash flows for our customers, which could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022 the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022 oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022 the level of excess production capacity;\n\u2022 political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;\n\u2022 the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022 access to potential resources;\n\u2022 governmental policies and subsidies;\n\u2022 the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022 weather conditions.\nConstraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nRaw materials essential to our business, such as explosives, steel, metal powder, and electronics are normally readily available. Shortages of raw materials or long-lead times in receiving such materials as a result of high levels of demand or loss\nof suppliers during market challenges can trigger constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials, particularly where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource. An increase in military activity in certain parts of the world could impact the availability of explosives as capacity could potentially be diverted to supply military requirements. These delays and constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials used in our business and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nFailure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers\u2019 commitments, our customers\u2019 ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers\u2019 forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries.\nTo ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we typically start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers\u2019 forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\nFailure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.\nOur industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction to adjust to customers\u2019 needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.\nExpansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities, such as the planned new manufacturing and assembly facility and the addition of a second automated DynaSelect detonator line in Blum, Texas (together, the \"Blum expansion\"), include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansions or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Risks of the Blum expansion project and future expansions include:\n\u2022\nincreased costs associated with opening new facilities, including the ability to meet budget constraints on construction projects;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value;\n\u2022\nchallenges faced as a result of transitioning programs;\n\u2022\nadditional fixed or other costs, or selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by the new business;\n\u2022\na reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions;\n\u2022\nstrain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources, and\n\u2022\ninability to locate sufficient employees or management talent to support the expansion.\nPeriods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels\nof customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.\nDemand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation or regulations.\nEnvironmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as government initiatives to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, may significantly curtail demand for and production of fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus adversely affect future demand for our products. This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could limit or ban hydraulic fracturing, or lead to operational delays and increased costs, and therefore reduce demand for our products. If such additional international, national, state or local legislation or regulations are enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe manufacturing of explosives subjects DynaEnergetics to various environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe use of explosives is inherently dangerous. DynaEnergetics is subject to a number of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations covering all aspects of the business including general operating licenses, transportation domestically and internationally, storage requirements, waste disposal, manufacturing regulations, employee training and certification requirements, and labor regulations. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or in interruption of our business activities. DynaEnergetics\u2019 success depends on continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be passed that could create costly compliance issues. While DynaEnergetics endeavors to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, compliance with future laws and regulations may not be economically feasible or even possible. Even with compliance with applicable health and safety laws, it is possible that accidents may occur, potentially resulting in injury to our employees, equipment and facilities. Any accident could result in significant manufacturing delays, disruption of operations or claims for damages resulting from death or injuries, which could result in decreased sales and increased expenses.\nWe may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other perforating companies.\nDynaEnergetics competes principally with perforating companies based in North America, South America, and Russia, which produce and market perforating services and products. DynaEnergetics also competes with oil and gas service companies that are able to satisfy a portion of their perforating needs through in-house production. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for safety, quality, on-time delivery, and value. There can be no assurances that we will continue to compete successfully against these companies.\nRisk Factors Related to our Businesses Generally\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nWe are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries.\nMany of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in Euros or other foreign currencies such as the Russian Ruble. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 28%, 28%, and 23% of total sales for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics KG\u2019s functional currency is Euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries\u2019 assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the Euro due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the Euro is the functional currency and the Russian Ruble due to our operations in Tyumen, Siberia. During the third quarter of 2017, we began using foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the Euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, the Euro to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro to the Russian Ruble. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $18.3 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.\nA significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by\ncontinually improving commercial execution, product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry.\nSteel plate and steel pipe are key materials used our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics\u2019 businesses. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports, tariffs and quotas. Additional tariffs, such as those recently announced as planned on steel and aluminum, will increase our raw materials costs and ultimately increase the cost of our products to our customers. For our NobelClad business, this would impact our ability to compete on international projects and will negatively impact U.S. fabricators, which are strong consumers of NobelClad products. The downturn in the U.S. economy in fiscal 2010 had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel industry and on our NobelClad business. The prolonged duration of these conditions and any future downturns in the industry, or the imposition of additional tariffs and quotas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe depend on a limited number of significant customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer represented approximately 10% of consolidated revenue, and the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.\nIn most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all; and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply could subject us to future liabilities and could adversely affect our ability to conduct or to expand our business.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States, Germany, France, Canada and Russia, including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz). In France, the manufacture and transportation of explosives is subcontracted to a third party, who is responsible for compliance with regulations established by various state and local governmental agencies concerning the handling and transportation of explosives. Our French operations could be adversely affected if the third party does not comply with these regulations. We must comply with licensing requirements and regulations for the purchase, transport, storage, manufacture, handling and use of explosives. In addition, while our shooting sites in Tautavel, France are located outdoors, our shooting sites located in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines, which subject us to certain regulations and oversight of governmental agencies that oversee mines.\nWe are also subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation, as described below under \u201cLiabilities under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability\u201d and above under \u201cThe use of explosives subjects us to additional regulation, and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.\u201d\nIn addition, the shipment of goods, services, and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control, and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nAny failure to comply with current and future regulations in the countries where we operate could subject us to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, construct new facilities, or compete in certain markets or could require us to incur significant expenses in order to maintain compliance. Accordingly, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by our non-compliance with applicable regulations, by any significant limitations on our business as a result of our inability to comply with applicable regulations, or by any requirement that we spend substantial amounts of capital to comply with such regulations.\nOur operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including:\n\u25e6\ncivil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;\n\u25e6\ninflation; and\n\u25e6\ncurrency fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion restrictions; and\n\u2022governmental actions that may:\n\u25e6\nresult in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;\n\u25e6\nresult in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u25e6\nlimit or disrupt markets or our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;\n\u25e6\nresult in the deprivation of contract rights; and\n\u25e6\nresult in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.\nLiabilities under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the countries where our manufacturing facilities are located. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. In particular, any failure to control the discharge of hazardous materials and wastes could subject us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe and all our activities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. In France, we and all our activities are subject to state environmental and safety regulations established by various departments of the French Government, including the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Ecology and the Ministry of Industry, and to local environmental and safety regulations and administrative procedures established by DRIRE (Direction R\u00e9gionale de l\u2019Industrie, de la Recherche et de l\u2019Environnement) and the Pr\u00e9fecture des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Orientales. In addition, our shooting operations in France may be particularly vulnerable to noise abatement regulations because these operations are primarily co\nnducted outdoors. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is operated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years.\nChanges in or compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. Some laws and regulations impose strict liability and/or joint and several liability. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.\nOur failure to comply with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nWe are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anticorruption laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and U.S. laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.\nWe have worldwide operations. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved and the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in or interpretation of tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nCorporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, the 2017 Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate, and imposed base-erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. entities. The 2017 Tax Reform Act will affect the tax position reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and our obligations for cash taxes of our U.S. entities and will have a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018.\nIn addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.\nDue to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters, particularly in Germany and France, where some of our employees are unionized. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we experienced a total of 11 days work stoppage at our facility in Rivesaltes, France related to the consolidation program of NobelClad's European explosion welding operations. We could experience additional strikes or work stoppages in the future as a result of our planned closure of manufacturing operations in Rivesaltes, France during 2018. The employees at our U.S. manufacturing facilities are not unionized. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If decided adversely to DMC, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We have an active freedom to operate review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims, such as those raised in the ongoing GEODynamics litigation, generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs.\nA failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and causes losses.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and\ninclude, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which is scheduled to go into effect in May 2018 and contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U. based data subjects. We will be subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. states reframe their national legislation to prepare for and harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced.\nThe introduction of the GDPR, and any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR there are significant new punishments for noncompliance which could result in a penalty of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTo the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nidentifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nobtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC\u2019s shareholders;\n\u2022\nmaintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;\n\u2022\nimplementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nto the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:\n\u2022\nchanges in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets;\n\u2022\noperating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our business or in our business sectors generally;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; and\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be impaired. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.", "PERMNO": 33823, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "BOOM"}
