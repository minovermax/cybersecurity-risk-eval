{"cik": "766421", "company": "ALASKA AIR GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. The trading price of our common stock could also decline. We operate in a continually changing business environment. In this environment, new risks may emerge, and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence. Management cannot predict such developments, nor can it assess the impact, if any, on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forward-looking statements.\nWe have adopted an enterprise-wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization, assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight. These enterprise-wide risks align to the risk factors discussed below.\nCOVID-19\nThe global pandemic caused by COVID-19, and related measures implemented to combat its spread has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations, financial position and liquidity.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus and its resulting disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China. Since that time, COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the globe, including within the United States, where millions of cases have been positively diagnosed to date. Although travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders have largely been lifted following the rollout of vaccination programs, the rise of new variants has led to volatility in bookings and overall demand for air travel. This volatility, coupled with low recovery of business travel, had and continues to have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, our operations have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected if our employees or vendor partners are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to COVID-19.\nIn response to the pandemic, we implemented, and continue to refine and adjust, a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impacts on our business. This strategy may itself have negative impacts on our business and operations. Our strategies for encouraging air travel may continue to evolve in response to emerging variants. These new strategies may require further investment, and if not successful, may not generate related revenues to offset these costs. One such action is the elimination of change fees for first and main cabin fares and the ability to rebook travel for an extended period beyond standard rebooking terms. The loss of change fee revenue, combined with ongoing significant ticket cancellation activity, has adversely impacted our revenues and liquidity.\nAt this time, we are unable to predict what impact the pandemic will have on future customer behavior. New variants, particularly those which are vaccine-resistant, may result in further variability in advance booking and refund activity. The recovery of business travel may be impacted by widespread use of video conferencing or the reduction of business travel budgets. In addition, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur COVID-19 related costs in response to the need for higher staffing levels as well as for enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among employees and guests. These contingencies, individually and in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe have accepted certain conditions by accepting funding under the Payroll Support Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\nThe CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020, providing U.S. airlines and related businesses the ability to access liquidity in the form of grants, loans, loan guarantees and other investments by the U.S. government.\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Company, Alaska, Horizon, and McGee entered agreements with the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to secure approximately $2.3 billion of funding under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program (PSP) and two related extensions. Of total funding, $600 million is in the form of an unsecured senior term loan payable over ten years. PSP proceeds were used exclusively for employee payroll and benefits expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PSP agreements and the applicable provisions of the CARES Act.\nIn addition to repayment commitments, we remain subject to the following conditions under our CARES Act agreements:\n\u2022The Company may not repurchase its common stock or pay dividends on its common stock until October 1, 2022;\n\u2022Compensation and severance payments for officers and employees who earned more than $425,000 in total compensation in 2019 will be subject to maximum limitations through April 1, 2023; and\n\u2022The Company must maintain certain internal controls and records, and provide any additional reporting required by the U.S. government.\nThese conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with loyalty partners, our attractiveness to investors, and our ability to compensate at market-competitive levels and retain key personnel.\nMandatory vaccination programs could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial results.\nThe President's executive order dated September 9, 2021 requires employees of government contractors to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air are government contractors by virtue of their agreements with the U.S. government for the carriage of passengers and mail, among other activities. McGee Air Services is subject to the executive order as a subcontractor of Alaska Airlines. As of the date of this filing, the executive order is subject to unsettled legal challenges, and its legality must be upheld in the judicial system prior to its enforcement by the government. Should the executive order be upheld in its current form, employers may excuse employees from the vaccination requirement only with a valid medical or religious exemption. Alaska, Horizon and McGee operate in highly competitive job markets in which the pool of available employees is limited. Our companies, contractors, and vendor partners whose services we rely on to run our operation may lose current or prospective employees because individuals decline to be vaccinated. If our companies, contractors, and vendor partners cannot fill job vacancies with other qualified workers, operational disruption and associated negative impact to guests and our financial results could result. If we cannot comply with the scope and/or timing of the executive order or similar state mandates, we could lose business and revenues associated with our government contracts.\nSAFETY, COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident.\nAn accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our Company by the flying public and/or aviation authorities. We could experience significant claims from injured passengers, bystanders and surviving relatives, as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service. We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers. However, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft, could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives. This would harm our business.\nOur operations are often affected by factors beyond our control, including delays, cancellations and other conditions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs is the case for all airlines, our operations often are affected by delays, cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control.\nFactors that might impact our operations include:\n\u2022contagious illness and fear of contagion;\n\u2022congestion, construction, space constraints at airports, and/or air traffic control problems, all of which many restrict flow;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022lack of operational approval (e.g. new routes, aircraft deliveries, etc.);\n\u2022increased security measures or breaches in security;\n\u2022changes in international treaties concerning air rights;\n\u2022international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity;\n\u2022interference by modernized telecommunications equipment with aircraft navigation technology; and\n\u2022other changes in business conditions.\nDue to the concentration of our flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers. A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the above-mentioned factors could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on vendors for certain critical activities and sourcing, which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases.\nWe rely on vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business, including airframe and engine maintenance, regional flying, ground handling, fueling, computer reservation system hosting, telecommunication systems, information technology infrastructure and services, and deicing, among others.\nEven though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels, our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks. In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy, ceases operation or fails to perform as promised, for reasons such as supply chain delays, or workforce shortages, replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates, or at all. If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately, we may experience increased costs, delays, maintenance issues, safety issues or negative public perception of our airline. Vendor bankruptcies, unionization, regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms. These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure.\nImpacts of climate change, including legal, regulatory or market responses, may have a material adverse result on our operations and/or financial position.\nConcerns regarding climate change, including the impacts of a gradual increase in global temperatures leading to more severe weather conditions, continue to rise. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could cause significant and prolonged impacts to our operation or disrupt our supply chain. These disruptions may result in increased operating costs and lost revenue should we be unable to operate our published schedules.\nMany aspects of our operation are subject to increasing regulations governing environmental change. Increased governmental regulation involving aircraft emissions and environmental investigation and remediation costs coupled with public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may require us to make significant investments in emerging and yet unproven technologies. Should these technologies not gain approval for use in our operation, our results of operations may be adversely impacted, and we may be required to direct new investments to different technologies. Failure to comply with increasing regulation, or in addressing the concerns of our guests and our shareholders, may adversely impact financial position, our results of operations, or our stock price.\nChanges in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements, both domestically and internationally, that require substantial compliance costs. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the U.S. DOT, the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft, operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections.\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal, state and local levels. These initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment, minimum wage requirements, mandatory paid sick or family leave, and health care mandates. These laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs. New initiatives with employer-funded costs, specifically those impacting Washington State, could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared to our competitors. In recent years, the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws, particularly in California. Application of these laws may result in operational disruption, increased litigation risk, and impact on negotiated labor agreements.\nAlmost all commercial service airports are owned and/or operated by units of local or state governments. Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost. Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security, updates to infrastructure, and other expenses. Additional laws, regulations, taxes, airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer\npurchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which would harm our business. Additionally, changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance. Any instances of non-compliance could result in additional fines and fees.\nThe airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs.\nTerrorist attacks, the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the U.S. could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry, including us, and could:\n\u2022significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel;\n\u2022significantly increase security and insurance costs;\n\u2022make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive;\n\u2022increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices;\n\u2022increase costs from airport shutdowns, flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats; and\n\u2022result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA.\nThe occurrence of any of these events would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSTRATEGY\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.S. airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition. Airlines compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity, route systems, and the number of markets served. Several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve, particularly in our key West Coast markets. This dynamic may be exacerbated by competition among airlines to attract passengers during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit cost-reduction goals. This is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital. If we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the long-term and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital, we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns. Therefore, our financial results may suffer.\nThe airline industry may undergo further restructuring, consolidation, or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring, consolidation, and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures. Since deregulation, both the U.S. and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions. Carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances, slot swaps/acquisitions and/or joint ventures. Certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes, pool revenues and costs, and enjoy other mutual benefits, achieving many of the benefits of consolidation.\nOur concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations.\nOur strategy involves a high concentration of our business in key West Coast markets. A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle, Portland, and Bay Area hubs. In 2021, passengers to and from Seattle, Portland, and the Bay Area accounted for 82% of our total guests.\nWe believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft and ground facilities, as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions. As a result, we remain highly dependent on our key markets. Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets. An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that, if sustained, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts.\nAlaska is dependent on Boeing and Airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts. Horizon is similarly dependent on Embraer and De Havilland. Additionally, each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type. As a result, we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA. Should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers, it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods. Additionally, if effects of the ongoing economic recovery and/or supply chain backlog causes our limited vendors to have performance problems, reduced or ceased operations, bankruptcies, workforce shortages, or other events causing them to be unable to fulfill their commitments to us, our operations and business could be materially adversely affected.\nShould these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft, we may not be able to grow our fleet at intended rates, which could impact our financial position. Boeing has significant production constraints for the 737-9 aircraft, which may impact the timing of deliveries. If we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner, our growth plans could be negatively impacted. Additionally, further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers. This could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured.\nWe rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements.\nOur airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers, or \u201cpartners,\" including an expanded relationship with American. These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner \u201ccodeshare\u201d flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights. Refer to Item 1 above for details regarding these codeshare agreements. In addition, the agreements generally provide that members of Alaska\u2019s Mileage Plan program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa. We receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements. In addition, we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our loyalty program. The loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy, consolidation, or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan program, which we believe is a source of competitive advantage.\nOur entry into the oneworld global alliance is expected to provide us with many benefits, including the ability to seamlessly connect our guests to more points around the globe, as well as better serve corporate partners. Entry into the alliance may cause us to lose existing codeshare agreements with partners who are not oneworld members, and could limit options to bring non-oneworld carrier partners into our Mileage Plan program. Further, maintaining an alliance with another U.S. airline may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny. Failure to appropriately manage these partnerships and alliances could negatively impact future growth plans and our financial position.\nWe routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position, including alliances, codeshare arrangements, interline arrangements, and frequent flyer program enhancements, and will continue to pursue these commercial activities. If other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization, those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships.\nEconomic uncertainty, or another recession, would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe airline industry, which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand, is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. We are particularly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and the health of the U.S. economy. Unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel. For some consumers, leisure travel is a discretionary expense, and shorter distance travelers, in particular, have the option to replace air travel with surface travel. Businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as video conferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs, which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat. Unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel, labor and other costs. Unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTECHNOLOGY\nWe rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business, including expanded reliance on systems managed or hosted by third parties. Failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business.\nWe heavily depend on automated systems to operate our business. This includes our airline reservation system, check-in kiosks, website, telecommunication systems, maintenance systems, airline operations control systems, flight deck/route optimization systems, planning and scheduling, mobile applications and devices, and many other systems. These systems require significant investment of employee time and cost for maintenance and upgrades. Failure to appropriately execute these procedures may result in service disruptions or system failures. Additionally, as part of our commitment to innovation and providing an attractive guest travel experience, we invest in new technology to ensure our critical systems are reliable, scalable, and secure.\nWe also continue to expand our reliance on third party providers for management or hosting of operational and financial systems. Should these providers fail to meet established service requirements or provide inadequate technical support, we could experience disruptions in our operation, ticketing or financial systems. Additionally, all of our automated systems cannot be completely protected against events beyond our control, including natural disasters, computer viruses, cyberattacks, other security breaches, or telecommunications failures.\nSubstantial or repeated failures or disruptions to any of these critical systems could reduce the attractiveness of our services or cause our guests to do business with another airline. Disruptions, failed implementations, untimely or incomplete recovery, or a breach of these systems or the data centers/cloud infrastructure they run on could result in the loss of important data, an increase in our expenses, loss of revenue, impacts to our operational performance, or a possible temporary cessation of our operations.\nWe continue to monitor emerging technologies, including technologies which may have disruptive impacts which are out of our control, such as the rollout of 5G wireless service. We will continue to work with regulatory agencies and other air carriers to mitigate potential impacts of these technologies on the safety and security of air travel.\nFailure to appropriately comply with evolving and expanding information security rules and regulations or to safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost.\nAs part of our core business, we are required to collect, process, store and share personal and financial information from our guests and employees. Under current or future privacy legislation, we are subject to significant legal risk should we not appropriately protect that data. Our entrance into the oneworld alliance exposes us to incremental global regulation and therefore risk. In addition, we continue to expand our reliance on third-party software providers and data processors, including cloud providers. Unauthorized access of personal and financial data via fraud or other means of deception could result in data loss, theft, modification, or unauthorized disclosure. To the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information experience a data breach, fail to appropriately safeguard personal data, or are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws, and regulations, we could be subject to additional litigation, regulatory risks and reputational harm. Further, as regulation of the collection and storage of personal and financial information continues to evolve and increase, we may incur significant costs to bring our systems and processes into compliance.\nCyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business. Failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations, onboard safety, reputation and financial condition.\nOur sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks. Our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks. Unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information, including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception. Methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify. Because of these ever-evolving risks and regular attacks, we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices. However, the nature of these attacks means that proper policies, technical controls, and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access. Emerging cybercrime threats include the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service, or other attacks. A compromise of our systems, the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could result in substantial costs for response and remediation, adversely affect our operations and our reputation, and expose us to litigation, regulatory enforcement, or other legal action. A cybersecurity attack impacting our onboard or other operational systems may result in an accident or incident onboard or significant operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, operation and financial position. Further, a significant portion of our office employees have transitioned to remote work, which increases our exposure to cyberattacks, and could compromise our financial or operational systems.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business.\nFuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses. Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and fixed obligations, and have incurred substantial incremental debt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These obligations could lead to liquidity restraints and have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nWe carry, and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future, a substantial amount of debt and aircraft operating lease commitments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we obtained new financing to fund operations through periods of unprecedented low demand, and for the unknown duration of any economic recovery period. Although we aim to keep our leverage low, due to our high fixed costs, including aircraft lease commitments and debt service, a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings.\nOur outstanding long-term debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures, working capital or other purposes; require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Further, should we incur incremental obligations, issuers may require future debt agreements to contain more restrictive covenants or require additional collateral beyond historical market terms which may further restrict our ability to successfully access capital.\nAlthough we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due, we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future. If we fail to do so, our business could be harmed.\nOur maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages, and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the average age of our Next Gen passenger aircraft (B737-700, -800, -900, -900ERs) was approximately 10.9 years, the average age of our B737-9 was approximately 0.4 years, the average age of our operating A320 and A321neo aircraft was approximately 9.3 years, the average age of our owned E175 aircraft was approximately 3.6 years, and the average age of our Q400 aircraft was approximately 13.7 years. Typically, our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future. Any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in incremental maintenance expense as we are required to return leased planes in a contractually specified condition.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording goodwill, which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn accordance with acquisition accounting rules, we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the Virgin America acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of Virgin America\u2019s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually. We could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of, among other items, extreme fuel price volatility, a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets, unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows, uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties. We can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods. Any such charges may materially affect our financial results.\nBRAND AND REPUTATION\nAs we evolve our brand we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests.`\nWe continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers. These efforts could include significant enhancements to our in-airport and on-board environments, increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals (digital and mobile) and optimization of our customer loyalty programs. In pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base.\nThe Company's brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media.\nWe operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media. Negative publicity, including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees, or failure to adhere to COVID-19 related health and safety protocols, can spread rapidly through social media. Should the Company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity, the Company's brand and reputation may be significantly harmed. Such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nLABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGY\nA significant increase in labor costs, unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLabor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses. In addition to costs associated with represented employee groups, labor costs could also increase for non-unionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major U.S. airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market.\nOngoing and periodic negotiations with labor unions could result in job actions, such as slow-downs, sick-outs, or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during negotiations, although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts, the operation could be significantly impacted. Although we have a long track record of fostering good communications, negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our long-term vision, unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert management\u2019s attention from other projects and issues, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract, retain and train qualified personnel, or maintain our culture, could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe compete against other major U.S. airlines for pilots, aircraft technicians and other labor. As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age, the U.S. airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage. Attrition beyond normal levels, or the inability to attract new pilots, could negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, the industry, including related vendor partners, has experienced and may continue to experience challenges in hiring and retaining other labor positions, such as aircraft technicians, ground handling and customer service agents and flight attendants. The Company's or our vendor partners' inability to attract and retain personnel for these positions could negatively impact our operating results, which may harm our growth plans. Additionally, we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages, or pay increased rates to our vendors, to retain these positions. This would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our guest experience and financial position.\nOur success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a unified culture with cohesive values and goals. Much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty. Failure to maintain and grow the Alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests, suppliers, employees and other constituencies. As part of this process, we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs.\nREGULATION\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to our company than to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 28804, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "ALK"}
