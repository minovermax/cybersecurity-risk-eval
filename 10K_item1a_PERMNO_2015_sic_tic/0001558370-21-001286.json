{"cik": "1374310", "company": "Cboe Global Markets, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us. Any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties described below that we believe are material to us at this time:\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to trading behavior broadly in the market;\n\u25cf the loss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures products;\n\u25cf economic, political and market conditions; compliance with legal and regulatory obligations;\n\u25cf price competition and consolidation in our industry;\n\u25cf decreases in trading or clearing volumes, market data fees or a shift in the mix of products traded on our exchanges;\n\u25cf legislative or regulatory changes;\n\u25cf our ability to protect our systems and communication networks from security risks, cybersecurity risks, insider threats and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information;\n\u25cf increasing competition by foreign and domestic entities;\n\u25cf our dependence on and exposure to risk from third parties;\n\u25cf fluctuations to currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf our index providers\u2019 ability to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices and to perform under our agreements;\n\u25cf our ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others and the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel;\n\u25cf our ability to minimize the risks, including our credit and default risks, associated with operating a European clearinghouse;\n\u25cf our ability to accommodate trading and clearing volume and transaction traffic, including significant increases, without failure or degradation of performance of our systems;\n\u25cf misconduct by those who use our markets or our products or for whom we clear transactions;\n\u25cf challenges to our use of open source software code;\n\u25cf our ability to meet our compliance obligations, including managing potential conflicts between our regulatory responsibilities and our for-profit status;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain BIDS Trading as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with our registered national securities exchanges;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf the ability of our compliance and risk management methods to effectively monitor and manage our risks;\n\u25cf our ability to manage our growth and strategic acquisitions or alliances effectively;\n\u25cf restrictions imposed by our debt obligations and our ability to make payments on or refinance our debt obligations;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain an investment grade credit rating; and\n\u25cf impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments or intangible assets.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19, however, the extent to which our results could be affected by COVID-19 largely depends on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. Governments, public institutions, and other organizations around the world have taken, and may take additional, emergency measures to combat its spread, including rollouts of vaccinations, implementation of travel\nbans and closures of offices, factories, schools, public buildings and businesses. These measures may interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors, technology equipment suppliers, data and disaster recovery centers, and other service providers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. In particular, between March 13, 2020 and June 14, 2020, we temporarily suspended open outcry trading in response to COVID-19. In addition to uncertain expenses we may incur due to COVID-19 as part of us providing a safe and healthy work and trading environment, employees working remotely from different locations and in connection with our eventual return to our offices, we may also be subject to claims from employees or customers alleging failure to maintain safe premises and restrictions with respect to protocols relating to COVID-19. Further, changes in trading behavior, impacts to trading behavior due to the temporary suspension of open outcry trading, market disruptions, additional temporary suspensions of open outcry trading, temporary regulatory measures and other future developments caused by the effects of COVID-19, including a re-occurrence of cases, could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products, market data and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and could heighten many of the other risks described below.\nLoss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, as well as others, granted to us by the owners of such indices, and additionally hold exclusive rights to our proprietary VIX methodology that provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. In 2020, approximately 58.0% of our net transaction and clearing fees (defined below) were generated by futures and index options, the overwhelming majority of which were generated by our exclusively-licensed products (e.g., SPX options) and products based on our proprietary VIX methodology (e.g., VIX options and futures). The bulk of this revenue is attributable to our SPX options and VIX options and futures. As a result, our revenues less cost of revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX methodology and related products and indices.\nThere is a risk, with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses, that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all. In the first event, we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis, which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability. In the second event, we could lose the right to list the index product entirely. The loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses, especially for the S&P 500 Index, for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nIn addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses, if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX methodology and related products and indices, our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe EU has adopted legislation affecting providers and users of benchmark indices in the EU MiFIR requires benchmarks used to value a financial instrument in the EU to be made available on a non-discriminatory basis to all EU trading venues and central counterparty clearing houses for the purposes of trading and clearing. As a result, owners of such benchmarks must provide licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. While similar legislation to MiFIR has not been proposed in the U.S., if it were passed, it could cause us to lose our exclusive rights to list and trade internally developed and licensed index products. Further, in 2018, the EU implemented the EU Benchmark Regulation, which regulates users, data providers and calculators of benchmarks (\u201cadministrators\u201d) in the EU, and among other things, prohibits use of benchmarks in connection with a financial instrument unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an equivalent regulatory regime and the benchmark is registered in an EU member state. These regulations and other emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers\u2019 interest in or ability to trade index-based products listed on our U.S. exchanges, as well as impact our expansion activities to establish foreign trading of our index-based products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the U.S.\nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, offering and providing a market for the trading of index-based or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products. It is also possible that a third party may offer trading in index-based products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses, but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license.\nThe value of our licenses to exclusively list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices. Although we and the\nindex owners have prevailed in legal actions challenging our rights to exclusively license indices, we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures.\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business.\nThe volume of trading and clearing transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf economic, political and geopolitical market conditions;\n\u25cf broad trends in business and finance;\n\u25cf concerns over inflation and wavering institutional or retail confidence levels;\n\u25cf government or central bank actions, such as changes in government fiscal and monetary policy and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf other legislative and regulatory changes;\n\u25cf the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;\n\u25cf the perceived attractiveness of the U.S. or European capital markets;\n\u25cf the availability of alternative investment opportunities;\n\u25cf changes in the level of trading activity in underlying instruments;\n\u25cf changes and volatility in the prices of securities;\n\u25cf changes in the volume of foreign currency transactions;\n\u25cf changes in supply and demand for currencies;\n\u25cf movements in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf the level and volatility of interest rates;\n\u25cf changes in the financial strength of market participants;\n\u25cf consolidation among market participants and market data subscribers;\n\u25cf unforeseen market closures, suspensions of open outcry trading or other disruptions in trading and clearing; and\n\u25cf disruptions due to terrorism, war, extreme weather events, pandemics or other catastrophes.\nAny of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading and clearing volumes and demand for market data.\nOur business may be adversely affected by price competition.\nThe securities industry is characterized by intense price competition, especially with respect to transaction fees. We may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and value-added market data, such as historical market data.\nIn our options segment, the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions, and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly, including by opening new exchanges, which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants. These changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us, especially on transaction fees and incentives for multi-listed products. As a result of these pricing pressures, our average rate per multi-listed options contract may decrease. It is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets.\nIn addition, one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume. Some order-providing firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them.\nWith respect to our proprietary products, we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, including SPY, which offer some of the features of our proprietary products.\nTo attract market share, we may offer \u201cinverted\u201d pricing specials or no-transaction fee trading from time to time. BZX also offers a \u201ccross-asset add volume tier\u201d that gives a bigger rebate for additional volume on both the BZX equities and options platforms. Similarly, EDGX offers a \u201ccross-asset tier\u201d that gives a reduced fee for volume on both the EDGX equities and options platforms. These forms of promotions may adversely affect our profitability.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner. Also, our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees.\nA significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction and clearing-based business. If the amount of trading volume on our markets or clearing volume decreases, or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products, our revenues from transaction and clearing fees will most likely decrease.\nIn 2020, approximately 63.2% of our revenues less cost of revenues were generated by our transaction and clearing-based business. This business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. If the amount of trading volume on our Exchanges, CFE, and MATCHNow, notional value traded on Cboe FX, Cboe SEF and Cboe Europe Equities exchanges or clearing volumes at EuroCCP decreases, we are likely to see a decrease in fees.\nOur total trading or clearing volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading or clearing activity for any reason, such as:\n\u25cf heightened capital requirements;\n\u25cf transaction tax;\n\u25cf regulatory or legislative actions;\n\u25cf reduced need to trade due to changes in volatility and/or passive investment trends;\n\u25cf reduced access to capital required to fund trading activities;\n\u25cf consolidation among market participants;\n\u25cf suspensions of open outcry trading; or\n\u25cf significant market disruptions.\nOver the past few years, a number of legislative actions have been taken, both domestically and internationally, that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens. These actions, including the Collins Amendment to Dodd-Frank, MiFID II and MiFIR, may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our Exchanges.\nIn addition, the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors, including the type of customer and certain volume discounts. If the amount of our trading volume decreases, the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products, our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease. We can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease.\nRevenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share, trading volumes or regulatory changes.\nThe occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive, whether as a result of fee reductions, fewer members subscribing to the U.S. tape plans, declines in market share or trading volumes (or notional volume in the case of Cboe Europe Equities) or regulatory changes will have a direct negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. For example, if our market share of U.S. listed equities and options, or Cboe\u2019s European equities trading, were to decline, our share of market data fees could also decline. Moreover, market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users, for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise.\nRegulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity, or our cost in providing such services. In the U.S., we are generally required to file with the SEC any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees. In recent years, certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products. In addition, the SEC and some media have scrutinized market data and market access. As discussed above, the implementation of the new Market Data Infrastructure rules could cause Cboe\u2019s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nIn addition, as discussed above, the SEC issued a final Consolidated Data Plan Order that would require U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA to develop and file a new consolidated data plan. If the Consolidated Data Plan Order were to be implemented, it may have a negative impact on the market data fees we charge and there could be a negative impact on our revenues. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nWe believe Cboe Europe Equities currently offers market data to customers on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. As European regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data, it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our European market data revenues. While MiFID II and MiFIR aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in Europe, should this fail to materialize, policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering.\nThe technology upon which we rely, including those of our service providers, may be vulnerable to security risks, cybersecurity risks, insider threats, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, operational disruptions, and other risks and events that could harm our business.\nThe secure and reliable operation of our technology, including our computer systems and communications networks, and those of our service providers and market participants, is a critical element of our operations. These systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents, improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential, commercially sensitive, or personally identifiable information, data theft, corruption or destruction, cyber-attack, malware and other security problems, as well as acts of terrorism, natural disasters, human error, criminal insider activity, power loss and other events that are beyond our control. As previously disclosed, in 2018, we discovered and initiated an investigation of an internal theft of idled and deactivated computer servers and networking devices. We subsequently resolved the incident by, including, among other actions, terminating the employment of the responsible individual, reporting the matter to regulators and law enforcement, and improving our policies, procedures and controls over the physical security and protection of our computer systems and communications networks to help minimize the risk of reoccurrence.\nWe currently maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems, networks and information more broadly, and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access. These policies, procedures and controls are subject to periodic monitoring, auditing, and evaluation practices, pursuant to our enterprise risk management program. Further, we developed and maintain cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our third-party consultants who have access to our systems, which includes simulations, tabletop exercises, and response readiness tests. Independent third-party cybersecurity penetration assessments are also routinely performed. Collectively, these safeguards and measures may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents, subjecting us to contractual restrictions, liability and damages, loss of business, penalties, unfavorable publicity, and increased scrutiny by our regulators, and materially impacting our financial condition and operating results. We may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures, including to protect against threatened breaches, to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach, and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability. Such harms also could cause us to lose market participants, experience lower trading volume, and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, and as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIntense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance.\nThe market for trade execution services, clearing and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate. Increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction and clearing fees and market data fees, thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results. We compete with a number of entities on several different fronts, including the cost, quality and speed of our trade execution, functionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms, range of our products and services, our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation. See \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d for more information.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products, to offer lower transaction and clearing fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can. In addition, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce and/or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products.\nFurthermore, new or existing competitors may:\n\u25cf respond more quickly to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf develop products that compete with our products or are preferred by our customers;\n\u25cf offer products and services at prices below ours to gain market share and to promote other businesses;\n\u25cf develop and expand their technology and service offerings more efficiently;\n\u25cf provide better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology;\n\u25cf take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities;\n\u25cf market, promote, bundle and sell their products and services more effectively;\n\u25cf leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners more effectively or exploit brand names to market and sell their services; and\n\u25cf exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets, including over-the-counter markets, that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model.\nIf our products, markets, services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology, customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe depend on third-party service providers for certain services that are important to our business. An interruption, significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on a number of service providers, including clearing organizations such as OCC, NSCC, DTC, CDS, LCH, EuroCCP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and SIX x-clear; securities information processors such as the CTA, UTP Securities Information Processor and OPRA; regulatory and other service providers such as FINRA and OCC; the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers; and various vendors of communications and networking products and services. In addition, we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing transactions on our behalf. More specifically:\n\u25cf If OCC, NSCC, DTC, CDS, LCH, EuroCCP and SIX x-clear were unable to perform clearing services for existing or new products, or their clearing members were unable or unwilling to clear through them, transactions could likely not occur on our markets or there may be delays, including until clearing is moved to another clearing agency. In 2020, approximately 58.0% of our net transaction and clearing fees were generated by options and futures that were cleared through OCC.\n\u25cf OPRA, UTP Securities Information Processor and the CTA consolidate options and equities market information such as last sale reports and quotations. If any of them were unable to provide this information for a sustained period of time, we may be unable to offer trading on our options and equities markets.\n\u25cf We are heavily dependent on technology for our markets, including our data and disaster recovery centers, some of which are housed by third parties, and certain communications and networking products and services. If this technology is unavailable, and cannot be replaced in a sufficiently short time period, we may be unable to operate our markets.\n\u25cf We utilize Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) to maintain secondary offsite backups of our and our customers\u2019 data and may utilize AWS in the future for additional services. We do not control the operations of AWS or their facilities and may be vulnerable to disruptions in our access to the platform as a result of a number of potential causes, including technical failure, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Additionally, any vulnerability of AWS could expose our or our customers\u2019 confidential data, which could result in harm to our business reputation.\n\u25cf FINRA and OCC provide certain regulatory services and functions for our options, equities and futures exchanges, while we retain regulatory responsibilities for such services. If FINRA or OCC stopped providing services, or provided inadequate services, we may be subject to action by the SEC or CFTC, or may have limitations placed upon our markets.\n\u25cf We rely on FINRA CAT LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA, to provide services for the implementation of the CAT. If FINRA CAT LLC stops providing services or provides inadequate services, we and the other execution venues may incur regulatory liability including enforcement action by the SEC or limitations placed upon our markets. In addition, until the SEC approves a funding model that shares the cost of the CAT between the SROs and industry members, the SROs may continue to incur additional significant costs, including as a result of replacing the plan processor, or result in not being able to collect on the promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT.\n\u25cf We rely on third party routing and clearing firms to clear trades in U.S. listed equity securities routed by us to other markets, and to execute trades in options that we route to other markets.\nWith respect to options, all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of OCC. At December 31, 2020, there were 97 TPHs that are clearing members of OCC. Two clearing members accounted for approximately 62.9% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC in 2020. The next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 18.0% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC. Additionally, the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX and at all of the options exchanges. Should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges, impose additional market-maker financial requirements or if market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity, this could create a significant disruption to the options markets, including ours.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party\u2019s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services, make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business, cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to experience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our inability to make alternative arrangements, such as moving clearing to another clearing agency, in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. expose us to currency risk.\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in the UK, continental Europe, Canada, Ecuador, Hong Kong and Singapore. We, therefore, have exposure to exchange rate movements between the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, and the Singapore dollar against the U.S. dollar. Significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, Brexit or changes in local interest rates. These exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations and financial condition into U.S. dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary products, index methodologies and other proprietary rights. In addition, we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusively-licensed index options and futures products. We and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying, or otherwise obtaining and using, our intellectual property without authorization, listing our proprietary or exclusively-licensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights. We and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of\nothers or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We and our licensors may not be successful in this regard. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us, diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel. As a result, to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees. However, we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us. The roles and responsibilities of departing executive officers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees, which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space, which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers. If we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. In particular, failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures. Consequently, our reputation may be harmed, we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we have historically done.\nAdditionally, effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nOur clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties.\nWe are subject to risks related to operating our clearinghouse, EuroCCP, including the risks of failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight, risks of default by clearing participants and counterparties, due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons, and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants\u2019 margin and default funds. These risks could subject our business to substantial losses, reputational harm, regulatory consequences, including litigation, fines and enforcement actions, and the inability to operate our business, including the continued development of the European derivatives buildout.\nTo mitigate the credit risks related to defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties, including the market risk that we would only be able to close out a defaulting participant\u2019s positions at a loss, there are minimum participation criteria to become a clearing participant and clearing participants are required to provide collateral to cover the margin requirement and default fund contributions. No guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient or provide absolute assurance against us experiencing financial losses from defaults by the participants or counterparties on their obligations. In addition, although such collateral is preferably held in European central banks and central securities depositories, there are occasions where commercial banks are used, which can expose us to risk of default by those banks. In addition, EuroCCP entered into a \u20ac1.5 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility that is available to be drawn by EuroCCP towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP\u2019s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system, however we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all such obligations or sufficiently mitigate EuroCCP\u2019s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Substantial amounts of the collateral, and any amounts drawn under this facility, may be at risk if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin and default fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. This facility is expected to terminate on July 1, 2021 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that the mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures will be sufficient to detect problems or to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.\nComputer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in trading outages, lower trading and clearing volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Although we have a back-up plan of significant trading and key corporate systems, the back-up systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cyber-security breach. Despite having disaster recovery facilities, there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient, transparent and liquid marketplace, if we can open at all, following a systems failure. Moreover, with extended trading hours, we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer non-trading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely.\nOur markets and clearinghouse have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail, in whole or in part, or may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following:\n\u25cf unanticipated disruption in service to our participants;\n\u25cf failures or delays during peak trading times or times of unusual market volatility;\n\u25cf slower response times and delays in trade execution, clearing and processing;\n\u25cf incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording, clearing or processing of trades; and\n\u25cf distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data to participants who rely on this data in their trading activity.\nAny of these events may cause:\n\u25cf a loss in transaction, clearing or other fees due to the inability to provide services for a time;\n\u25cf requests by market participants or others that we reimburse them for financial loss, either within the constraints of the limited liability provisions of our exchanges\u2019 rules or in excess of those amounts;\n\u25cf trading and clearing volumes to diminish on our markets and clearinghouse due to dissatisfaction with the platforms; and\n\u25cf one or more of our regulators to investigate or take enforcement action against us.\nAs a consequence of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.\nIn addition to other measures, we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading and clearing activity or times of unusual market volatility. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading or clearing volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading or clearing volume without failure or degradation of performance.\nWe anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading or clearing activity and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be materially adversely affected.\nOur use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re-engineer our software, which could harm our business.\nOur technology platform uses open source software code. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. In addition, some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated. We believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code. However, if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source\ncode, re-engineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in, or impose significant costs on, our business.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to:\n\u25cf the representation of our business in the media;\n\u25cf the quality and benefits of using our proprietary products, including the reliability and functionality of our transaction-based business and the accuracy of our market data;\n\u25cf the ability to execute our business plan, key initiatives or new business ventures and the ability to keep up with changing customer demands and regulatory initiatives;\n\u25cf our regulatory compliance and our enforcement of compliance on our customers;\n\u25cf the accuracy of our financial statements and other financial and statistical information;\n\u25cf the quality of our corporate governance structure;\n\u25cf the quality of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, including any failures in supervision;\n\u25cf the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems;\n\u25cf security breaches, including any unauthorized delivery of proprietary data to third parties;\n\u25cf management of our outsourcing relationships, including our relationship with FINRA and NFA;\n\u25cf any misconduct or fraudulent activity by our employees, especially senior management, or other persons formerly or currently associated with us;\n\u25cf our listings business and our enforcement of our listing rules; and\n\u25cf any negative publicity surrounding the ETPs that we serve as the listing destination.\nDamage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our markets or cause us to lose customers. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFinancial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, clearing agents and counterparties. For example, we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears. Our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. For additional credit risks related to our clearinghouse operations, see the Risk Factor \u201cOur clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties.\u201d\nIn addition, with respect to orders Cboe Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Cboe Trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf, as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. Thus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that Wedbush or Morgan Stanley fails to perform. With respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver reports of matched trades of our customers to the CDS, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades.\nWith respect to routed U.S. equity transactions, Cboe Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to Wedbush and Morgan Stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date. Cboe Trading uses Wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools. Morgan Stanley clears trades routed through the Morgan Stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools. Cboe Trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing\nbrokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution. Additionally, BIDS Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to BOA related to clearing until the day following the trade date.\nWith respect to U.S. listed equity and exchange traded product options, Cboe Trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers\u2019 next invoice cycle has completed for an execution.\nOur exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers, counterparties and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. Moreover, we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures, reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards. Any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile neither Cboe FX nor Cboe SEF has direct counterparty risk, Cboe FX or Cboe SEF may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Cboe FX and Cboe SEF may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot FX on the Cboe FX platform, or NDFs on Cboe SEF.\nWe may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service, which could subject us to trading losses when our broker-dealer disposes of that position.\nWe offer a smart-order routing service through our broker-dealer subsidiary, Cboe Trading, which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution. In connection with this service, we may assume ownership of a position in securities. This may occur, for example, when a market center to which we have routed a customer\u2019s order experiences systemic issues and is unable to determine the status of that order. When this happens, we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer, relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order. We may be informed later, however, that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it, in which case Cboe Trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position. Our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of Cboe Trading into which such positions settle, and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible, which could result in our incurring trading losses.\nWe may not effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect that our business will continue to grow, which may place a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. We must continually improve our operational, financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures, and may need to continue to expand, train and manage our workforce. We must also maintain close coordination among our technology, legal, accounting, finance, marketing, sales, regulatory and compliance functions. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. Furthermore, failure to successfully expand into new asset classes or new geographies may materially adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability.\nOur continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology, facilities, personnel, and financial and management systems and controls. It also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations, and we will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. The expansion of our existing businesses, any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes, which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required. We may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary. Further, unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. We may not be successful in integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. Any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities. If we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders, whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock.\nFor example, in 2020, we purchased Hanweck and the assets of FT Options, which are providers of risk analytics market data, the assets of Trade Alert, a real-time alerts and order flow analysis service provider, EuroCCP, an operator of a European clearinghouse, and MATCHNow, an operator of an equities ATS in Canada. At the end of 2020, we also purchased BIDS Trading, a registered broker-dealer and operator of the BIDS ATS in the U.S., which is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof.\nThe process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory issues and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation. We may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. However, the ATS operated by BIDS Trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof, as such, Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges.\nWe may be required to inject further capital into OCC or return dividends received back to OCC.\nOCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our options and futures exchanges. In January 2020, upon receipt of SEC approval, OCC established a capital management policy providing that, if OCC\u2019s equity capital falls below certain defined thresholds, OCC can access additional capital through an operational loss fee charged to clearing members. Although Cboe Options does not have a legal or contractual obligation to contribute capital to OCC under OCC\u2019s capital management policy or otherwise, given OCC\u2019s importance to Cboe\u2019s businesses, if OCC were to experience financial difficulties, Cboe Options might nevertheless effectively (but not legally) be required to inject further capital into it in order for OCC to maintain sufficient working or regulatory capital. In a worst-case scenario, OCC might have its regulatory license suspended or withdrawn, or might have to wind down. This may result in a loss to Cboe Options of its investment in OCC and withdrawal of OCC as a clearing house, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, while OCC\u2019s new capital management policy is now effective, there remains some degree of uncertainty as to the terms and conditions of the wind-down of OCC\u2019s prior capital plan, under which OCC\u2019s shareholders (including Cboe Options) provided equity capital to OCC and received annual dividends in respect thereof, and which was disapproved by the SEC on February 13, 2019. Depending on the terms on which the prior OCC capital plan is ultimately required to be unwound, Cboe Options could potentially be required to return dividend payments received from OCC during the time the capital plan was in effect.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA are registered national securities exchanges and SROs, and, as such, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the SEC. CFE is a DCM and Cboe SEF is a SEF, each registered with the CFTC and subject to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC. In addition to its other SRO responsibilities, BZX, as a listing market, also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on BZX and monitoring each issuer\u2019s compliance with BZX\u2019s continued listing standards. Failure to comply with these SRO responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on Cboe\u2019s reputation and/or branding.\nOur European businesses are subject to regulatory oversight in the UK by the FCA and in the Netherlands by the DNB and the AFM, which, through the \u201cpassporting\u201d regime, provides authorization to carry on business in other Member\nStates of the EU and the EEA in accordance with the applicable EU legislation and regulation to which our European business is subject. MATCHNow is subject to regulatory oversight in Canada by the IIROC and the OSC. BIDS Trading is a registered broker-dealer subject to regulatory oversight in the U.S. by the SEC and FINRA and is expected to be maintained as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the SROs. BIDS Trading Chief Executive Officer, Tim Mahoney, is expected to remain in his current role and lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the Board of Directors of Cboe Global Markets. If a regulatory authority makes a finding of non-compliance, conditional fines could be imposed, and our licenses could be revoked. Any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to the requirements related to operating our U.S. markets imposed by the SEC and the CFTC, we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the TPHs and members that trade on our Exchanges. While we have entered into agreements under which FINRA, with respect to our options and equities exchanges provides certain regulatory services, we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our TPHs and members. We have begun to perform internally more of the regulatory services that FINRA used to handle and now perform internally the regulatory functions that NFA previously handled on behalf of CFE.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the ability of FINRA and OCC to perform under their respective RSAs, the ability of FINRA and OCC to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under their respective RSAs, our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our TPHs and members and our oversight of the work done by FINRA and OCC. The SEC and CFTC have broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by, as applicable, SROs, DCMs and SEFs pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nIf a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient, our SROs, DCM, or SEF could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange, DCM, or SEF. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our SROs, DCM, or SEF may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.\nIn addition, SROs are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions. In light of these responsibilities, some courts have held that SROs are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions. There is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims. There is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine. Limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation, and increase liability and/or other legal expenses. Further under the Commodity Exchange Act, CFE and Cboe SEF may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith. We also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim.\nLegislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FCA, DNB, AFM, IIROC, OSC, foreign regulators or other government action, including SEC approval of rule filings by other SROs or entities, including OCC, could materially affect our markets and clearinghouse. In recent years, the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries. We have also experienced, and we may also experience due to the recent elections and changes in administrations in the U.S., an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business.\nStarting in 2015, large U.S. banks were required to use a calculation methodology known as the current exposure method (\u201cCEM\u201d) to compute regulatory capital requirements associated with the clearing guarantee provided by bank-affiliated OCC clearing members. U.S. banks, as well as European banks that also apply CEM, are required to maintain regulatory capital that is disproportionate to the risk of clearing options contracts and has led to further increases in capital requirements for bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries involved in the trading and clearing of derivatives. In\nNovember 2019, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved replacing CEM with a more risk-sensitive calculation method known as the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk (\u201cSA-CCR\u201d), which is expected to reduce capital requirements associated with the clearing of listed options. Banks subject to the November 2019 Final Rule are required to adopt SA-CCR by January 1, 2022 but have been able to do so since April 1, 2020. If the implementation of SA-CCR does not occur earlier than 2022, during that time we may experience a reduction in trading in options and futures due to bank-affiliated clearing members charging their customers more to trade, reducing the type or number of customers or withdrawing from the business of market-maker clearing.\nFurther, Congress, regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading and the structure of equity markets in recent years. The SEC continues to consider various potential market structure changes, which could result in reduced trading volumes, or which could negatively affect our business. To the extent the SEC adopts regulatory changes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and we are party to one such matter. See Note 24 (\u201cCommitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees-Legal Proceedings\u201d) for more information. To the extent the SEC adopts additional regulatory changes related to market data and access and capacity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, as discussed above, in December 2018, the SEC approved the transaction fee pilot. The transaction fee pilot or a successor may cause Cboe\u2019s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or challenge the transaction fee pilot or a successor and it may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, shifts in order flow away from exchanges were to occur. On June 16, 2020, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the transaction fee pilot and remanded it back to the SEC for reconsideration. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nUnder EU regulations, European banks and other European financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a non-qualifying clearinghouse. OCC, our clearinghouse for options and futures, is not currently recognized as a qualified clearinghouse by the EU; however, the OCC is working with the EU to qualify as a foreign clearinghouse equivalent. As a prerequisite to becoming qualified, OCC could be required by the EU to contribute significant capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing member default. This capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of non-defaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member\u2019s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted. OCC\u2019s stockholders, including Cboe Options, could effectively be required to fund this capital. If the EU does not recognize OCC as a qualified clearinghouse by June 15, 2021 (or by a subsequent date in the event that the current deadline is extended), then European market participants that clear through OCC would become subject to punitive capital charges. As a result, we could experience the loss of a significant number of European market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in Europe. MiFID II and MiFIR have introduced a number of new rules, including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements, which apply directly to European trading venues such as our MTF and RM. The impact of MiFID II and MiFIR is significant, and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading volumes and trading fees, while increasing our costs of operating in Europe. Additionally, European authorities are planning to continue to review MiFID in 2021 as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot FX market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past, and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot FX industry. The FX Global Code was published in 2017 and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale FX market, and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations, or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements, may also adversely affect our spot FX business. Further, our FX NDF business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities.\nIt is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate our businesses. Actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the U.S. or Europe and other proposals could have a material impact on our business.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign legislatures and regulators and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could materially adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all. Any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants\u2019 trading activity on our Exchanges and markets.\nIf one or more of the index providers from which we have licenses or service providers with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them or if customer preferences change, or if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices, revenues we generate from trading in these proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements pursuant to which we may list for trading securities options on various indices including license agreements that we have with S&P, for the S&P 500, S&P 100 and S&P Select Sectors Indices, DJIA, LSEG and MSCI. These license agreements provide that we are authorized to list products based on their indices, and some of the resulting index options and futures are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges. We also enter into licensing agreements pursuant to which we calculate and disseminate values of proprietary indices. The quality and integrity of each of these indices are dependent on the ability of the index providers, including us, to maintain the index, including by means of the calculation and rebalancing of the index, and are dependent on the index providers for a number of things, including the provision of index data. We also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses. Furthermore, some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products provide for the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us. If any of our index providers, including us, are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices, or if any of the index providers or service providers fail to perform their obligations under the agreements, trading in these products, and therefore transaction fees we receive, may be materially adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated.\nAny infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur competitors, as well as others, have obtained, or may obtain, patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products, services or technologies. In addition, some potential patent applications in the U.S. are confidential until a patent is issued, and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products, services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications. Thus, we cannot be sure that our products, services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us. Claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry, and even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention. If one or more of our products, services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party, we may be required to pay damages, stop using, developing or marketing those products, services or technologies, obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders, or redesign those products, services or technologies to avoid infringement. If we were required to stop using, developing or marketing certain products, services or technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. Moreover, if we were unable to obtain required licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMisconduct by our TPHs, members, participants or others could harm us.\nWe run the risk that our TPHs, members, participants, other persons who use our markets or our products, other persons for whom we clear transactions, our employees or those with which we have business relationships may engage in fraud, market or product manipulation, or other misconduct, which could result in regulatory and legal sanctions and penalties and serious harm to our reputation, especially because we are the parent company of SROs. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, or market or product manipulation, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. In addition, misconduct, or market or product manipulation by, or failures of, participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our Exchanges or of our products, which could reduce revenues.\nPotential conflicts of interest between our for-profit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business.\nAs a for-profit business with regulatory responsibilities, we are responsible for disciplining TPHs and members for violating our rules, including by imposing fines and sanctions. This may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities. Any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the SEC or CFTC to take action against us, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBIDS Trading\u2019s ability to operate under its current regulatory framework is dependent upon the sufficiency of a novel operational and governance framework we have developed to govern our relationship with BIDS Trading and our ability to comply with such framework and if we fail to adhere to such framework or the BIDS Trading ATS is otherwise deemed a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. equities ATS operated by BIDS Trading is regulated as a broker-dealer sponsored alternative trading system and not a registered national securities exchange. Because we acquired BIDS Trading, it is now under common ownership with our registered national securities exchanges that, in some cases, offer trading in the same securities as those traded on the BIDS Trading ATS. Absent sufficient separation, this common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities presents the potential for the BIDS Trading ATS to be deemed a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges. If the BIDS Trading ATS were to be deemed to be a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges, certain exchange regulations could be extended to the BIDS Trading ATS, which could have a material adverse impact on BIDS Trading\u2019s business model. This could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS\u2019 competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us. This could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a \u201cfacility,\u201d which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTo mitigate the risk that the BIDS Trading ATS is deemed a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges, we have developed and implemented an operational and governance framework for our ownership of BIDS Trading that is intended to preserve the strategic, technological, business, and operational independence of the BIDS Trading ATS from our registered national securities exchange businesses, such that the BIDS Trading ATS and our registered national securities exchanges would not be deemed to be integrated or otherwise linked for \u201cfacility\u201d purposes. This framework is supported by highly detailed policies, procedures and controls. However, because of the lack of precedent for common ownership of an ATS and registered national security exchanges offering trading in the same securities, there is risk that our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls could be deemed to be insufficient to prevent the BIDS Trading ATS from being deemed to be a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges. In addition, because of the comprehensive and highly detailed nature of our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls, there is risk that we could inadvertently fail to fully adhere to our operational and governance framework and related policies, procedures and controls. There is also risk that new legislation or regulation, or changes in existing regulation or other government action, relating to \u201cfacilities\u201d of registered national securities exchanges and/or the common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities could materially affect our ability to own and operate the BIDS Trading ATS under the current operational and governance framework, including without the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges. Occurrence of any of the risks described in this paragraph could result in the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed to be a \u201cfacility\u201d of our registered national securities exchanges, which could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS\u2019 competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us, and could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a \u201cfacility,\u201d which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBrexit could have a negative impact on the UK and EU economies and lead to considerable uncertainty while new treaties are negotiated.\nIn addition to the economic uncertainty the Brexit Vote, Brexit and expiration of the Transition Period bring, there are a number of potential risks that investors should consider:\n\u25cf Political uncertainty. Following the Brexit Vote, the UK entered into a period of acute political uncertainty both as to the nature and timing of the negotiations with the EU. Such uncertainty led to a high degree of economic and market disruption and legal uncertainty. While some certainty has been established following the EU and UK\ntrade deal, which is limited in scope, it is not possible to predict the outcome of future trade negotiations and the impact they will have on the UK in general and markets more broadly.\n\u25cf Legal uncertainty. A significant proportion of English law currently derives from or is designed to operate in concert with EU law. This is especially true of English law relating to financial markets, financial services, prudential and conduct regulation of financial institutions, bank recovery and resolution, payment services and systems, settlement finality, and market infrastructure. This body of European law was formally incorporated into English law prior to the end of the Transition period. However, as the long-term relationship between the UK and EU with respect to financial services is negotiated, significant changes to English law may be required, and we cannot predict what these changes will be and how they may affect our business.\n\u25cf Regulatory uncertainty. Because the EU and UK trade deal does not cover the entire financial sector, there is continued significant uncertainty about how the remaining EU countries (\u201cEU27\u201d) financial institutions with assets (including branches) in the UK and UK financial institutions with assets in the EU27 will be regulated in the future. Prior to Brexit, EU single market regulation allowed regulated financial institutions (including credit institutions, investment firms, alternative investment fund managers, insurance and reinsurance undertakings) to benefit from a passporting system for regulatory authorizations required to conduct their businesses, as well as facilitating mutual rights of access to important elements of market infrastructure such as payment and settlement systems. EU law is also the framework for mutual recognition of bank recovery and resolution regimes.\nOnce the UK ceased to be a member state of the EU, new restrictions on share trading came into force when trading began on January 4, 2021, preventing EU firms from accessing UK venues in EEA-listed securities. Passporting arrangements ceased to be effective, as did the mutual rights of access to market infrastructure and arrangements for mutual recognition of bank recovery and resolution regimes.\nNow that the UK has ceased to be a member state of the EU, the ability of regulated financial institutions to do business between the UK and the EU27 (and the wider EEA) is now subject to the potential development of future separate arrangements between the UK and the EEA. There can be no assurance that there will be any such arrangements concluded and, if they are concluded, on what terms.\n\u25cf Market uncertainty. Since the Brexit Vote and Brexit, there has been volatility and disruption of the capital, currency, exchange rates and credit markets. If this disruption and uncertainty continues, it may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn 2020, we derived 9.1% of our total revenues less cost of revenues from our UK operations. Depending on the outcome of the future separate arrangements between the UK and the EEA, companies with operations in the UK may face unfavorable business conditions to access the single market. In preparation for the current situation, Cboe Europe Equities established a regulated entity in the EU in addition to its existing entity in the UK so that it can continue offering its services to customers in both jurisdictions. Since the start of trading on January 4, 2021, the services of this new entity have been used more extensively, because Cboe Europe has seen a shift of almost all trading in EEA instruments from its UK to its EU venue. Similarly, EuroCCP participates in the UK Temporary Recognition Regime for CCP\u2019s allowing it to continue to operate in the UK as a CCP for up to three years after the UK ceases to be a member state of the EU pending permanent recognition under UK domestic law. Nevertheless, if the EU or the UK introduce new legislation that could restrict free competition or access to capital markets, the impact of such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our risk management and compliance methods are not effective, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, risk, audit, and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, risk and audit management personnel. These systems and procedures may not be fully effective. We face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties, settlements or civil lawsuits, including by customers, or third parties, for damages, which may be substantial. For example, the SEC has previously brought actions against exchange operators, including us, for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and operating\nresults and, in extreme cases, our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof. As the parent company for SROs, other markets, and a clearinghouse, we are responsible for maintaining markets that comply with securities and futures laws, SEC, FCA, AFM, DNB, IIROC, OSC, ESMA, and CFTC regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges, markets and clearinghouse.\nWe have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks. Management of legal, compliance, and regulatory risk, among other risks, requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk. If our policies, procedures, and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective, or that our management, compliance department, risk department and related enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness. If these departments or the enterprise risk program, and related policies and procedures are not effective, we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators, and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\nOur ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation, which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes.\nOur Exchanges registered with the SEC must submit proposed rule changes to the SEC for its review and, in many cases, its approval. Even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the SEC, the SEC retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change. Also, the CFTC may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for CFE or Cboe SEF. The rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets. If the SEC or CFTC delays, including because of a government shutdown, or does not allow one of our Exchanges to implement a rule change, this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities.\nSimilarly, the SEC must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries\u2019 certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Cboe Global Markets. The SEC may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change, which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products.\nChanges in the tax laws and regulations affecting us, our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLegislation may be proposed, both domestically and internationally, that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets. More recently, a number of federal, state and local jurisdictions in the U.S. and EU Member States have considered a financial transaction tax, but many details remain to be discussed and agreed, including how to assess the tax. If such proposals were to become law, they could have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants, which may reduce trading or clearing and could make our markets less competitive, and they could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our operations.\nIn addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants, like other corporations, we are subject to taxes at federal, state and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes, which would in turn reduce our net income. If this occurs, we may experience a higher effective tax rate.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness\nWe have outstanding indebtedness, which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $68.7 million outstanding under our term loan facility, $645.9 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027, $489.3 million of senior unsecured notes due 2030, no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no funds outstanding under the EuroCCP credit facility. The financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, we may\ndefault on our obligations or violate the covenants, in which case, we may be required to seek a waiver of such default or the debt obligations may be accelerated. A default under any of our indebtedness with cross default provisions could result in a default on our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness will also increase future borrowing costs, and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. We are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Further, a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to affect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDeterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have investment grade credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings (A-) and Moody\u2019s Investor Service (A3). Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings, since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs could increase.\nIf our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired, the resulting charge to earnings may be significant.\nWe are required to assess investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. In the future, we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill, long-lived assets, intangible assets or investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount. The board\u2019s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC and other factors that the board deems relevant. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Cboe Global Markets depends entirely on distributions, if any, it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. If these subsidiaries are not profitable, or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable, including discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us. These include provisions:\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u25cf requiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders; and\n\u25cf limiting the persons who may call special stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nIn addition, our organizational documents include provisions that:\n\u25cf restrict any person from voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 20% of our outstanding voting capital stock; and\n\u25cf restrict any person from beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.\nFurthermore, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. Any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus materially adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nDelaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board\u2019s wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation\u2019s board of directors.\nFurthermore, the European countries where we operate regulated entities, such as the UK and Netherlands, may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93429, "SIC": 6200, "TIC": "CBOE"}
