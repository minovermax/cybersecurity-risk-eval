{"cik": "1544227", "company": "OvaScience, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur short operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe commenced active operations in April 2011. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, identifying potential fertility treatments, researching and developing the OvaTure, OvaPrime and AUGMENT treatments, introducing the AUGMENT treatment in\nselect international IVF clinics, and determining the development and regulatory paths for our fertility treatments. Any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by young businesses in new and rapidly evolving fields. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including pursuing clinical trials of the OvaPrime treatment and introducing that treatment into international IVF clinics, completing development and optimization of the OvaTure treatment, continuing to make the AUGMENT treatment available in select international markets, obtaining any required approvals, manufacturing, marketing and selling those potential fertility treatments that we successfully develop, and addressing the challenges of foreign operations.\nIn addition, as a young business with a short operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown challenges. We recently announced a change in our corporate strategy, including a shift to focus on the development of OvaPrime and OvaTure. We cannot assure you that this shift will be successful.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $82.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $250.2 million. We have recorded limited revenues to date and have financed our operations primarily through equity financings. We have devoted significant efforts to research and development, acquiring our technology, researching and developing the OvaPrime, OvaTure and AUGMENT treatments and building out our international infrastructure.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We anticipate that our expenses will increase if and as we:\n\u2022\nadvance the clinical development of the OvaPrime treatment, including through ongoing clinical trials as well as any AUGMENT clinical trials;\n\u2022\nPursue OvaTure fertilization studies;\n\u2022\ncontinue advancing the preclinical development of the OvaTure treatment, both internally and in collaboration with Intrexon, including the maturation of an EggPC cell-derived egg, and the development of other potential fertility treatments, and ultimately introduce the OvaTure treatment;\n\u2022\neducate physicians and embryologists regarding the use of the OvaTure, OvaPrime and AUGMENT treatments;\n\u2022\nin the long term, establish a domestic and international sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our fertility treatments;\n\u2022\ninitiate any additional clinical trials of our fertility treatments;\n\u2022\ncollaborate with Intrexon through the OvaXon joint venture to develop significant improvements in human and animal health using our EggPC cell technology and Intrexon's synthetic biology and high throughput platform for applications;\n\u2022\nseek any required approvals from the FDA or similar regulatory agencies outside of the United States, which we refer to as Foreign Regulatory Authorities, for our potential fertility treatments that require such approval;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nhire additional scientific, clinical, quality control and management personnel internationally and in the United States to support our fertility treatment development efforts;\n\u2022\nseek to identify additional potential fertility treatments; and\n\u2022\ndevelop, acquire or in-license other potential fertility treatments and technologies.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize our potential fertility treatments with significant market potential, including the OvaTure treatment and the OvaPrime treatment and continue to offer the AUGMENT treatment commercially, and determine strategies to scale our treatments commercially. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, completing preclinical and clinical trials for our treatments, obtaining any\nnecessary regulatory approvals and successfully commercializing, either alone or with partners. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our fertility treatment development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the development and commercialization of our fertility treatments. We are focused on developing the OvaTure and OvaPrime treatments and have introduced the AUGMENT treatment in IVF clinic accounts outside of the United States. We expect to incur significant expenses with respect to our continued development and optimization of the OvaTure treatment and our clinical trials for our fertility treatments. Any clinical trials that we are required to conduct for these fertility treatments will be costly. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $114.4 million at December 31, 2016, will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan for at least the next 24 months. There can be no assurances, however, that the current operating plan will be achieved or that additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical development of the OvaPrime treatment and the AUGMENT treatment, and subsequent adoption by international IVF clinics;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with preclinical development and subsequent clinical trials of the OvaTure treatment and other potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with establishing a domestic and international sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize fertility treatments that we successfully develop, and to continue to sell the AUGMENT treatment;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of the AUGMENT treatment and resulting revenues, as well as any future revenues we receive from our potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the non-commercial preceptorship training programs and clinical studies and trials;\n\u2022\nthe costs of continuing the optimization of the OvaTure treatment and preclinical development of that treatment, and our success in defining a clinical pathway;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in collaborating with Intrexon through the OvaXon joint venture to create new applications to prevent inherited diseases for human and animal health;\n\u2022\nfollowing any applicable regulatory process in the United States and abroad, including the premarketing and marketing approval requirements, to which any of our potential fertility treatments may be subject;\n\u2022\nfollowing any regulatory or institutional review board review of our potential fertility treatments that are subject to such review;\n\u2022\npreparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nestablishing collaborations and partnerships on favorable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping, acquiring or in-licensing other potential fertility treatments and technologies.\nIdentifying, developing and commercializing potential fertility treatments is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We may fail to achieve sufficient revenues from our fertility treatments to achieve profitability on our expected timelines or at all. We will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or potential fertility treatments.\nUntil the time, if ever, that we can generate sufficient revenues from our potential fertility treatments and from the AUGMENT treatment to become profitable, we plan to finance our cash needs through some combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or potential fertility treatments or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit, the unfavorable outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn October 2015, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us, certain of our executive officers, the members of our board of directors and certain of the underwriters from our January 2015 follow-on public offering of our common stock by investors alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On November 9, 2016, a second purported derivative action was filed against certain present and former officers and directors of the company alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste for purported actions related to our January 2015 follow-on public offering. While we believe we have substantial legal and factual defenses to these claims in these lawsuits and we will vigorously defend the lawsuits, the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict and quantify, and the defense against such claims or actions can be costly and divert management resources. In connection with these lawsuits, we could incur substantial costs and such costs and any related settlements or judgments may not be covered by insurance.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our fertility treatments, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize our fertility treatments, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our fertility treatments, and we have had limited success in our commercialization activities to date. We have introduced the AUGMENT treatment in partner IVF accounts outside the United States and will continue to offer the treatment to patients at clinic accounts in Canada and Japan. Our ability to generate revenue in the near term, however, will depend on continued enrollment at our clinic accounts, the number of commercial AUGMENT treatment cycles our clinic accounts perform and the treatment prices charged. In addition, we plan to continue clinical trials of the OvaPrime treatment, and preclinical development of the OvaTure treatment. However, these activities are at early stages and may not ever yield positive data or treatments that will become commercially available to patients.\nRisks Related to Research, Development and Commercialization of Our Potential Fertility Treatments\nWe have recently changed our corporate strategy to focus on the OvaPrime treatment and the OvaTure treatment, each of which is at a substantially earlier stage of development than the AUGMENT treatment. As a result, it will take a longer period of time for us to commercialize a product that will generate meaningful revenues.\nIn December 2016, we announced that we would slow the commercial expansion of the AUGMENT treatment, reassess our ongoing and planned clinical studies of AUGMENT, and undertake a corporate restructuring. These changes will enable us to extend our cash position into the first quarter of 2019 and increase our focus on the development of OvaPrime and OvaTure. Both of those treatments are at a substantially earlier stage of development than the AUGMENT treatment is. Accordingly, we expect that it will take a longer period of time for us to generate revenues from the sale of our treatments than it would have had we continued to pursue the commercial expansion of the AUGMENT treatment in accordance with our previous corporate strategy. The process of developing OvaTure and OvaPrime is uncertain and may never yield products that allow us to achieve revenue from their sale.\nThe science underlying the OvaTure treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and the AUGMENT treatment is based on recent discoveries, and as a result the programs are subject to a higher level of risk than programs based on longer extablished science. Additionally, our OvaPrime treatment and OvaTure treatment are at early stages of clinical and preclinical development, respectively, and may never yield treatments that can be successfully commercialized.\nThe OvaTure treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and the AUGMENT treatment are based on recent scientific discoveries relating to egg precursor cells. As a result, the programs are subject to a higher level of risk than programs based on longer established science.\nWe are continuing to develop the OvaTure treatment. While we have observed key criteria of developmental competence in EggPC cell-derived eggs in both human and bovine models, we will not know if we have successfully developed fertilizable, mature eggs until we have successfully fertilized them. We may find that there are important criteria for developmental competence that we are not observing, or that elements of the criteria for maturity that we have observed are inadequately developed for fertilization. While we have developed a limited number of human EggPC cell-derived eggs demonstrating criteria of maturity, we need to develop a robust and repeatable process to develop mature eggs. Further, we will require authorization from regulatory bodies outside of the United States to fertilize a human Egg PC cell-derived egg before we can test any eggs that we do mature. Fertilization studies may fail when we are able to start them. Therefore, there are significant aspects of the OvaTure treatment that will require additional innovation for us to continue its development. The recent nature of the scientific discoveries underlying the OvaTure treatment, the need for additional innovation and the absence of information about egg precursor cell technology from human clinical trials all increase the risks associated with this potential fertility treatment. In any event, we believe that it will be costly and time consuming to develop and successfully commercialize the OvaTure treatment.\nThe OvaPrime treatment has only recently been used in humans in our ongoing OvaPrime clinical study in the UAE and our ongoing OvaPrime clinical trial in Canada. The preclinical data we have generated for this treatments under development may not be replicated in humans.\nWe have limited patient experience with the AUGMENT treatment and our experience with the AUGMENT treatment to date may not be representative of what women will experience in the future. We continue to develop and optimize the AUGMENT treatment process and such modifications may lead to outcomes that are different from historical results. If results from clinics are unfavorable, the AUGMENT program could be delayed or abandoned. Further, international IVF clinics that we work with may determine not to provide or continue providing the AUGMENT treatment based on clinical efficacy, safety or commercial, logistic, regulatory or other reasons, or they may not expand their use of AUGMENT sufficiently for it to be a viable commercial offering.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop the OvaTure treatment, the OvaPrime treatment or other potential fertility treatments, and we may not successfully commercialize any of our treatments.\nIn December 2015 a study of OvaPrime was initiated in the UAE and in 2016, a clinical trial of OvaPrime was initiated in Canada. We plan to utilize the results of these studies during 2017 to assess the safety profile of OvaPrime and to help define the patient population most likely to derive the greatest benefit from treatment. The successful enrollment of patients in these clinical studies and their results, including whether and by how much the OvaPrime treatment boosts egg reserves, will impact our ability to further introduce and generate revenues from sales of the OvaPrime treatment. If the results are unfavorable, the OvaPrime treatment may not be viable or significant additional time and expense could be required before we are able to commercialize this potential fertility treatment. In December 2016, we announced that we are reassessing our ongoing and planned clinical studies of AUGMENT, including our planned multi-center clinical trial and the ongoing IVI-sponsored study in Valencia, Spain, and slowing our commercial expansion of AUGMENT.\nClinical studies of our fertility treatments are expensive, difficult to design and implement and uncertain as to outcome. Regulatory authorities and IRB or ethics committees regulate clinical trials and can suspend or terminate them for many reasons. Success in animal and preclinical studies does not ensure that studies in humans will be successful, and interim or preliminary findings do not necessarily predict final results. In addition, the timing of results from and completion of the studies will depend, in part, on our ability to enroll the studies on the timeline expected. Enrollment in any studies could be delayed for a number of reasons, including the unwillingness of patients to undergo, or physicians to prescribe, an additional surgical procedure in connection with IVF.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors, including:\n\u2022\ntiming and capacity of tissue processing facilities and third party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nnovelty of the potential fertility treatments being tested;\n\u2022\nform of infertility or severity of the condition being treated;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022\nrates of success of competitive fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the potential fertility treatments under study;\n\u2022\nknown side effects of the potential fertility treatments under study, if any;\n\u2022\nefforts of IVF clinics to facilitate enrollment in studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials for the OvaPrime treatment our other fertility treatments would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our potential fertility treatments, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Further, our inability to ramp up use of the AUGMENT treatment by clinics offering the treatment commercially may delay commercial acceptance of the treatment.\nOvaXon, our joint venture with Intrexon, is seeking to create new applications to prevent inherited disease for human and animal health that are based on a novel gene editing based technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.\nOvaXon, our joint venture with Intrexon, is developing new gene editing based applications to prevent inherited disease for human and animal health by leveraging Intrexon's synthetic biology technology platform and our technology relating to EggPC cells. OvaXon may experience difficulties in the future related to its gene editing platform, which could cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, and which OvaXon may not be able to solve. OvaXon may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring those processes to commercial partners, which may prevent OvaXon from completing studies or commercializing potential fertility treatments on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nThe clinical study requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential product candidate. The regulatory approval process for novel gene based fertility treatments such as those that OvaXon will pursue likely will be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates.\nThe FDA has never approved any gene therapy or gene editing technology for use in humans or other animals. Only one gene therapy product, UniQure's Glybera, which received an EU marketing authorization in 2012, has been approved in the Western world, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for OvaXon's potential treatments.\nOvaXon's technologies involve the use of synthetic biologically engineered products or synthetic biological technologies. Public perception about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetically engineered products and processes could influence public acceptance of OvaXon's technologies, potential products and processes. If OvaXon is not able to overcome the ethical, legal and social concerns relating to synthetic biological engineering, any potential treatments it develops may not be accepted. These concerns could result in increased expenses or abandonment of any potential fertility treatments OvaXon develops.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. Further, most of the laws and regulations concerning synthetic biology relate to the end products produced using synthetic biology, but that may change. For example, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues in December 2010 recommended that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms. Synthetic biology may become subject to additional government regulations as a result of the recommendations, which could require OvaXon to incur significant additional expenses in complying with these laws and regulations.\nRegulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and any new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require OvaXon to perform additional studies, increase OvaXon's development costs, which we share with Intrexon, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As OvaXon advances its potential new treatments in human and animal health, it will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If OvaXon fails to do so, we may be required to\ndelay or discontinue development of its potential fertility treatments. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential fertility treatment to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient revenue to maintain our business.\nDevelopment of our fertility treatments may not be successful. If we are unable to commercialize our fertility treatments or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe intend to continue to invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the identification, development and commercialization of fertility treatments. Our ability to generate revenues will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our fertility treatments. For example, our plans to develop the OvaTure treatment will depend upon the regulatory pathways applicable to the OvaTure treatment in regions of the world that we target.\nRegulatory authorities may conclude that certain of our fertility treatments qualify for a class of products exempt from pre-market review and approval. In some countries where we have introduced the AUGMENT treatment or may in the future plan to the AUGMENT treatment or the OvaPrime treatment, we believe that the AUGMENT treatment and OvaPrime treatment are not subject to regulatory requirements for extensive pre-market review and approval of an application for marketing authorization that apply to drugs, biologics, medicinal products and medical devices. However, applicable regulatory bodies may disagree with our view, and if they do, we and our clinic accounts may suffer significant delay or expense or may cease offering the treatment in such countries. In some jurisdictions where traditional pre-market approval such as that required for drugs, biologics, medicinal products and medical devices is not required for our treatments, we or our clinic accounts may be required to obtain special approval of or licenses from local institutions to study or use the AUGMENT treatment or OvaPrime treatment and/or license to offer such treatments. For example, in Spain, the IVI clinic commenced an investigator sponsored study of the AUGMENT treatment after receiving approval from the La Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Reproducci\u00f3n Humana Asistida (CNRHA) and our clinic account in Japan has commenced a non-commercial preceptorship training program after receiving approval from the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG). In some cases, there are no clear guidelines on what standards may apply to the AUGMENT treatment or OvaPrime treatment or what licenses or approvals may be required, and we therefore have engaged and will continue to engage in discussions with regulatory authorities in certain of the countries in which we have introduced or plan to introduce the AUGMENT treatment or OvaPrime treatment. If we or our clinic accounts are unable to obtain any required licenses or approvals in a particular country, if the application process takes longer than expected, or if additional licenses or approvals are required to commercialize the treatment on a large scale, then our introduction of the AUGMENT treatment or OvaPrime treatment in such countries may be delayed, we may incur additional expenses, and/or we may determine not to provide the treatment in such countries. Further, some or even all regulatory authorities may determine to classify the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment or our potential fertility treatments as drugs, biologics, medicinal products or medical devices. Any such regulation would mean, among other things, that we would have to conduct extensive clinical trials and would not be able to market such potential fertility treatments until we have received approval of an application for marketing authorization from the applicable regulatory authority. Other than as identified above, we have not applied for or received approval to market any fertility treatments from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials and filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third parties, including contract research organizations, to assist us in this process.\nIf we are required to conduct traditional pre-market approval clinical trials in any of the countries where we seek to commercialize our potential fertility treatments, we would be subject to significant additional risk. Prior to initiating any necessary clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments that may be required in particular regions, we may need to submit clinical trial applications (such as an IND or foreign equivalent) to regulatory authorities, based on preclinical, animal and other tests. Upon submitting such an application, the regulatory authorities might determine that the risks involved in our potential fertility treatments are too great to justify proceeding with a clinical study and impose a partial or full clinical hold. They may require us to do significant and costly additional preclinical work before commencing our clinical trials or may not allow us to proceed with clinical trials at all. In addition, an ethics committee or IRB would be required to review and approve any clinical trial before we can commence that trial. The ethics committee or IRB responsible for reviewing any of our clinical trials may decline to grant approval for a variety of reasons, including that they do not believe that patient rights would adequately be protected. Our potential fertility treatments rely on new and complex technology that impacts human reproductive systems. Therefore, regulatory authorities and ethics committees may be especially cautious in reviewing and approving our clinical protocols for such potential fertility treatments.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not predict the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many\ncompanies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. The FDA, equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities or an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time, for a number of reasons, including that continuing the study presents unreasonable risk to human subjects or that the rights of those subjects are not adequately protected.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any clinical trials or studies if we choose to or are required to conduct them, which could delay or prevent our ability to achieve our stated goals for our fertility treatments or receive marketing approval for or commercialize our fertility treatments, including:\n\u2022\nregulators, ethics committees, or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in reaching, or fail to reach agreement on, acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nstudies or clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments may produce negative or inconclusive safety or efficacy results, or results subject to varying interpretations, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon potential fertility treatment development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for studies or clinical trials, and/or the necessary duration of studies or clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in our studies or clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of our studies or clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe or our third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, such as conducting trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, and our contractors may fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nwe may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments for various reasons, including a finding by a regulatory authority or IRB that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of studies or clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our potential fertility treatments or other materials necessary to conduct studies or clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete any studies or clinical trials or other testing of our potential fertility treatments, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are insufficient to demonstrate safety or efficacy to applicable regulators, or if there are any safety concerns regarding our potential fertility treatments, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval in countries where such approval may be required and therefore be unable to commercialize our fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intend or desire;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant restrictions on distribution or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing or other regulatory requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the treatment removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIf serious adverse side effects are identified during the development or commercialization of the OvaTure treatment, OvaPrime treatment, AUGMENT treatment, or any other potential fertility treatments or with any procedures with which these fertility treatments are used, we may need to abandon or limit our development of those fertility treatments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNone of the OvaTure treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the AUGMENT treatment nor any of our potential fertility treatments has been proven effective and safe in humans through clinical trials. We have limited patient experience with the AUGMENT treatment and our experience with the AUGMENT treatment to date may not be representative of what women will experience in the future. Further, we continue to develop the AUGMENT treatment, and changes to the treatment could result in future experiences with the treatment differing from past experience. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our\nfertility treatments will prove effective or safe in humans or, to the extent required, will receive marketing or other approval. If any of our current or potential fertility treatments are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected with respect to the mother or the child conceived using such treatment, we may need to abandon such treatments or limit their development and/or commercialization to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In addition, if any of the procedures with which our potential fertility treatments are used is determined to be unsafe, we may be required to delay or abandon our fertility treatment development or commercialization. For example, we expect the AUGMENT treatment will be administered as part of the ICSI process and the OvaPrime treatment will be administered as part of the IVF process. To the extent physicians limit or abandon the use of ICSI, IVF or other procedures with which the AUGMENT treatment or the OvaPrime treatment is used, we may need to delay or abandon our development or commercialization of these treatments.\nEven if we are able to continue the commercialization of the AUGMENT treatment or commercialize any of our other fertility treatments, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if we are able to continue the commercialization of the AUGMENT treatment or commercialize any of our potential fertility treatments, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients and others in the medical community. For example, doctors may continue to rely on current treatments, including fertility drugs and traditional IVF, which are well established in the medical community. In addition, the novel nature of the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and the OvaTure treatment may affect market acceptance by physicians and patients. We have limited patient experience with the AUGMENT treatment and our experience with the AUGMENT treatment to date may not be representative of what women will experience in the future. Our ability to gain market acceptance of the AUGMENT treatment will depend on the experience women have with this treatment option over time. If our potential fertility treatments do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant treatment revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our fertility treatments, after receipt of any necessary licenses or approvals, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nefficacy and potential advantages as compared to traditional IVF or other alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nability to reduce the number of IVF cycles required to achieve a live birth;\n\u2022\nability to reduce the cost of traditional IVF;\n\u2022\nability to reduce the incidence of multiple births;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target population to undergo, and of physicians to prescribe, an additional surgical procedure in connection with IVF;\n\u2022\nconvenience compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on mothers or children conceived using our potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nability to improve the side effect profile of infertility treatment;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target population and of physicians to try new therapies based on recent scientific discoveries;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the existing infrastructure to support the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment or our potential fertility treatments, including adequately trained embryologists and the willingness of IVF clinics to incorporate the process into their current treatment regimen;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of patients to pay out of pocket for our potential fertility treatments, which, in the case of the AUGMENT treatment and the OvaPrime treatment, will be in addition to the price of a standard IVF procedure;\n\u2022\nany negative publicity or political action related to our or similar potential fertility treatments or IVF; and\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully commercialize our potential fertility treatments will depend on the continued use and acceptance of IVF, ICSI and fertility treatments generally. To the extent that the medical community or patient population determines that these procedures are unsafe or are otherwise not generally accepted, the market for our potential fertility treatments and, therefore, our business would be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into additional agreements with third parties to sell and market our potential fertility treatments, we may not be successful in commercializing them.\nTo achieve commercial success for any potential fertility treatment, we must either develop a sales and marketing team or outsource these functions to third parties.\nThere are risks involved both with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay the introduction of any fertility treatment. If the commercial introduction or expansion of our treatments for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. For example, we incurred restructuring costs in connection with the corporate restructuring that we announced in December 2016.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our treatment revenues or the profitability of these treatment revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any potential fertility treatment ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our potential fertility treatments or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have limited control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our potential fertility treatments effectively and in compliance with applicable laws.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional potential fertility treatments. If we do identify additional potential fertility treatments, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular potential fertility treatment and fail to capitalize on potential fertility treatments that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nAn important element of our strategy is to identify and develop additional potential fertility treatments based on our EggPC cells technology. We may be unable to identify any such potential fertility treatments. If we do identify additional candidates, we may not advance such candidates into clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthere may be evidence that such candidates may have harmful side effects;\n\u2022\npreclinical studies may put into question the efficacy of such candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may determine that such candidates are unlikely to achieve marketing approval or market acceptance; or\n\u2022\nsuch candidates may be too costly to manufacture or market.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and potential fertility treatments based on which candidates we believe have the highest likelihood of success and commercial value. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other potential fertility treatments that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial treatments or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and potential fertility treatments may not yield any commercially viable treatments. For example, the programs we are considering relating to culture media and EggPC cells banking may not reach commercialization or, if commercialized, may not be successful. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular potential fertility treatment, we may relinquish valuable rights to potential fertility treatments through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements when it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such potential fertility treatment.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to additional technologies or potential fertility treatments, including from our scientific founders, for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe may be unable to acquire or in-license additional technologies or potential fertility treatments from third parties, including our scientific founders, in order to grow our business. A number of more established companies may also pursue strategies to license or acquire potential fertility treatments that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nFor example, we continue to work collaboratively with our scientific founders. These scientists continue to be active in the field of infertility and may develop new potential fertility treatments or intellectual property based on their continued research relating to infertility. The rights to new inventions by our scientific founders generally belong to the hospitals and academic institutions at which they are employed and are not subject to license or other rights in our favor. In the event that our scientific founders, or other third party scientists or entities, develop potential fertility treatments or intellectual property that we wish to acquire or in-license, we may be unable to negotiate such acquisition or in-license. Our failure to reach an agreement for any applicable potential fertility treatment or intellectual property could result in a third party acquiring the related rights and thereby harm our business.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire relevant potential fertility treatments on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nWe expect competition for acquiring and in-licensing potential fertility treatments that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing costs. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable potential fertility treatments on reasonable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nWe face substantial competition, including from more established infertility treatments, such as traditional IVF, as well as advances in new artificial reproductive technologies, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing potential fertility treatments before or more successfully than we do.\nThere are a number of fertility treatments that are generally accepted in the medical and patient communities, including fertility drugs, IUI and IVF. Competition in the infertility market is largely based on pregnancy and live birth rates and side effects of treatment on patients. Accordingly, our success is highly dependent on our ability to develop potential fertility treatments that improve pregnancy and live birth rates and reduce risks and side effects, as compared to existing treatments. The ability of any potential fertility treatment that we successfully develop to reduce the overall costs associated with IVF also will be an important competitive factor.\nCompetitors may develop new infertility drugs, assisted reproductive technology, or ART, therapies, devices and techniques that could render obsolete our potential fertility treatments. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of potential fertility treatments. Like our treatments, some of these potential fertility treatments are designed to address the shortcomings of IVF. In particular, we are aware of a number of companies and laboratories that are currently developing potential fertility treatments intended to identify high quality embryos for use in IVF, a university study of the transfer of granulosa cell mitochondria into eggs, a university study using pronuclear transfer for improvement in IVF success rates and a university study of induced pluriopotent stem cells, or iPS, shows that iPS cells can be generated from somatic cells and programmed to become differentiated cells, which can include germ line cells such as oocytes. Novocellus Ltd. is developing an embryo viability test, using culture media, to aid in the selection of embryos used in IVF. FertiliTech and Auxogyn, Inc. are developing hardware and software that analyzes embryo development against cell division timing parameters to help identify the highest quality embryo within a group of embryos. If successfully developed, these potential fertility treatments could improve outcomes and alleviate some of the other shortcomings of traditional IVF, thereby decreasing the need for our potential fertility treatments. Fertility Focus, along with its strategic partner Norgenix, are developing a fertiloscope for the early diagnosis of, and immediate corrective surgery for, the physical causes of infertility. Molecular diagnostic companies like Reprogenetics are developing novel preimplantation genetic diagnosis and screening methods to detect chromosomal and genetic disorders of embryos prior to transfer back to the women. Testing embryos in this manner may increase the likelihood of pregnancy, reduce the chances of pregnancy loss, and improve the odds of delivery. At this time, we cannot evaluate how our potential fertility treatments, if successfully developed and commercialized, would compare technologically, clinically or commercially to any other potential fertility treatments being developed or to be marketed by competitors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively. OvaXon is engaged in gene editing, which is a rapidly evolving field. OvaXon could potentially have competitors in both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Some of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we expect OvaXon to compete with include GlaxoSmithKline plc, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., HemaQuest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., and Novartis AG.\nOur competitors may develop and commercialize new technologies before we do, allowing them to offer potential fertility treatments, services or solutions that are superior to those that we may offer or which establish market positions before the time, if any, at which we are able to bring potential fertility treatments to the market. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of potential fertility treatments, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of potential fertility treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in developing, commercializing and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' potential fertility treatments may be safer, more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our potential fertility treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our potential fertility treatments. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nWe could be subject to negative publicity, political action and additional regulation because of the nature of our potential fertility treatments. These factors could increase our development and commercialization costs.\nOur potential fertility treatments are based on innovative science regarding eggs, embryos and fertilization, and in the case of our OvaXon joint venture, gene editing. These can be controversial subjects and, as a result, we could be subject to adverse publicity, political reaction and regulation, as well as changes to the laws and regulations affecting our potential fertility treatments. This may result in our incurring costs beyond what we anticipate in order to develop and commercialize our potential fertility treatments or may make it impossible to develop our potential fertility treatments at all. Bad publicity could also delay or impede our ability to obtain any necessary licenses or authorizations for us or our clinic accounts to introduce or continue to provide our treatments in countries where the criticism occurs. In addition, some states are considering adopting legislation defining when personhood begins. To the extent adopted, this legislation could limit, restrict or prohibit the use of IVF, which would have a negative effect on our ability to develop and sell our potential fertility treatments and, as a result, on our business.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any potential fertility treatments that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our fertility treatments in humans and will face an even greater risk as we continue the commercialization of the AUGMENT treatment, or if we successfully introduce the OvaPrime treatment or any other potential fertility treatment that we may develop, including potential fertility treatments developed by OvaXon. Product liability claims involving our activities may be made for significant amounts because our potential fertility treatments involve mothers and children. For example, it is possible that we will be subject to product liability claims that assert that our potential fertility treatments have caused birth defects in children or that such defects are inheritable. In light of the nature of our planned activities, these claims could be made many years into the future based on effects that were not observed or observable at the time of birth. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our potential fertility treatments caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any potential fertility treatment that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards or payments to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's resources; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any potential fertility treatments that we may develop.\nWe obtained product liability insurance coverage when we initiated our AUGMENT treatment study in the United States and introduced the AUGMENT treatment in select IVF centers outside of the United States. We will need to maintain product liability insurance coverage as we continue to offer the AUGMENT treatment outside of the United States, introduce the OvaPrime and OvaTure treatments, and/or conduct clinical trials for our current or potential fertility treatments. Such insurance is increasingly expensive and difficult to procure. In the future, such insurance may not be available to us at all or may only be available at a very high cost and, if available, may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. In addition, we may need to increase our insurance coverage in connection with the commercialization of our current or potential fertility treatments. If we are not able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nProcedures such as IVF, as well as companies that manufacture and store cells and tissues, are the subject of standards and recommendations by national regulatory authorities and/or non-governmental bodies. Failure to comply with these standards could harm our commercial prospects or subject us to negative media attention or government sanctions.\nVarious countries where we are seeking or may seek to introduce our fertility treatments have standards set by regulatory authorities and/or non-governmental bodies that govern IVF procedures and the procurement, storage and processing of gametes and embryos for use in IVF procedures. In the UK, for example, the HFEA has adopted a Code of Practice, as well as supplementary guidance documents, with which licensed IVF clinics are obliged to comply. Similarly, the UK's Association of Clinical Embryologists has adopted a series of best practice guidelines for its members. Even where these standards are voluntary, if we, or third parties that we work with, including IVF clinics, fail to comply with these standards, our commercial prospects could be harmed because patients may prefer to use the services and potential fertility treatments of companies that meet these standards. Similarly, physicians or IVF clinics may be less likely to endorse or use procedures or potential fertility\ntreatments that fail to comply with such standards. In addition, failure to meet the standards could subject us to negative media attention.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Potential Fertility Treatments and Other Regulatory Matters\nOur potential plans to commercialize the AUGMENT treatment in certain regions outside of the United States, to introduce the OvaPrime treatment in selected regions outside of the United States, and to continue to define the clinical pathway for development of the OvaTure treatment depend upon these treatments meeting the requirements of a class of products or a type of practice or treatment exempt from pre-market review and approval of applications for marketing authorizations in such regions. Determinations by regulators in the markets we target that these treatments do not meet the requirements for a class of products exempt from pre-market review and approval could significantly delay or prevent commercialization of those products. Failure to obtain marketing approval in international regions, to the extent required, would prevent our potential fertility treatments from being marketed in such regions. Additionally, our plans to continue to define the clinical pathway for the OvaTure treatment will depend upon the regulatory pathway applicable in regions of the world that we target.\nOur plans to continue the commercialization of the AUGMENT treatment outside of the United States, to introduce the OvaPrime treatment in select regions outside of the United States, and to continue to define the clinical pathway for development of the OvaTure treatment depend upon the treatments meeting the requirements of a class of products or a type of practice or treatment exempt from pre-market review and approval of applications for marketing authorizations in such regions. There can be no assurance that this will be the case in any particular jurisdiction, or that applicable Foreign Regulatory Authorities will agree with our determinations that our treatments meet these requirements. If the Foreign Regulatory Authorities in a given country disagree with our determination that our treatments are exempt from pre-market review and approval of applications for marketing authorizations required for drugs, biologics, medicinal products and medical devices, then we likely will be required to cease commercial marketing of that fertility treatment in that country, and may not be able to resume commercial marketing without first demonstrating safety and efficacy through clinical trials, submitting an application for marketing authorization, and receiving approval from the relevant regulatory authorities. In these circumstances, we are likely to be significantly delayed in our ability to commercialize our fertility treatments in such country, or we may elect to cease our commercialization activities in that country altogether. In 2012, we commenced a clinical study of the AUGMENT treatment in the United States relying on our conclusion that the AUGMENT treatment met the requirements for a section 361 HCT/P, and therefore did not require an IND. In September 2013, however, we received an \"untitled\" letter from the FDA questioning the status of the AUGMENT treatment as a section 361 HCT/P and advising us to file an IND for the AUGMENT treatment. As a result, we chose to suspend enrollment in our AUGMENT study in the United States. We are scheduled to speak with the FDA in the first half of 2017 as part of our ongoing exploration of potential entry into the U.S. market. However, we cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome of that meeting.\nWe will be unable to complete the development of OvaTure if we do not obtain authorization to fertilize an Egg PC cell-derived egg. Additionally, our plans to continue to define the clinical pathway for the OvaTure treatment will depend upon the regulatory pathway available in regions of the world that we target. From time to time, we engage in discussions regarding our fertility treatments with Foreign Regulatory Authorities in certain of the countries in which we have introduced or plan to introduce such fertility treatment or potential fertility treatment. We expect to have ongoing dialogue with these regulatory authorities. If any of our fertility treatments are subject to pre-market approval in a particular region, failure to obtain such required marketing approval in international regions would prevent us from marketing such fertility treatment in such regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFurther, if Foreign Regulatory Authorities in a particular region determine that our fertility treatments do not meet the requirements of a class of products that is exempt from pre-market approval of applications for marketing authorization , then in order to market and sell our potential fertility treatments in that region, we or our third party collaborators may need to obtain separate marketing approvals and will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements, as described above. Additionally, study or license requirements vary among countries and may cause delays of or suspension of the approval process and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval in foreign regions can be lengthy, and may differ substantially from region to region. The regulatory approval process outside the United States may be subject to risks like those associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries, a treatment must be approved for reimbursement before the treatment can be approved for sale in that country. Furthermore, some countries have restrictions particular to IVF and/or other fertility treatments, which may impose additional regulatory barriers for market entry for our potential fertility treatments. If required, we may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA for marketing in the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.\nBy way of example, regulators could determine that the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment or the AUGMENT treatment, and/or any other potential fertility treatments, do not meet the requirements for a class of products exempt from pre-market review and approval. In that case, they could be regulated as medicinal products (including advanced therapy medicinal products), as medical devices or as human tissues and cells intended for human applications. For example, products regulated as advanced therapy medicinal products may only be placed on the market in the EU once they have been granted a marketing authorization by the European Commission. Securing a marketing authorization from the European Commission requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information, including information about the manufacturing process, to the EMA to establish the potential fertility treatment's safety, efficacy and quality. Following review of the marketing authorization application the EMA will issue an opinion, which the European Commission will take into account when deciding whether or not to grant a marketing authorization. If we are required to follow this regulatory pathway for the OvaPrime treatment, OvaTure treatment, AUGMENT treatment or our potential fertility treatments, this may significantly delay or preclude commercialization of these treatments. Similar determinations in other markets outside of the United States could have the same impact.\nEven if regulators in regions outside of the United States, such as the EU, deem our treatments to be exempt from pre-market review and approval of an application for marketing authorization as required of drugs, biologics, medicinal products and medical devices, other regulatory requirements may nevertheless be applicable. For example, medical treatments and processes, such as IVF, may be regulated at the national level, which is the case in the EU. Such national regulations may restrict the extent to which the eggs used in IVF treatments may be manipulated and so may prevent us from commercializing our treatments in that country. Alternatively, such regulations may require the IVF facilities to be licensed by the national regulatory authority to perform specific IVF procedures or require us or our clinic accounts to obtain special approval of or licenses from national regulatory bodies to introduce our treatments in that country. For example, there are specific fertility regulatory authorities, such as the United Kingdom\u2019s HFEA, which license IVF facilities and determine what procedures such establishments may perform. In other countries, the national health authority may delegate the review of a fertility treatment to an industry self-regulatory body, an institutional review board, or other body. For example, the approval of our clinic account\u2019s application to use the AUGMENT treatment in Japan was made by the JSOG. Further, the investigator sponsored study of the AUGMENT with the IVI Group in Spain, was approved by the CNRHA. However, in some countries, there are no clear guidelines on what standards may apply to our treatments or what licenses or approvals may be required. While we have engaged and will continue to engage in discussions with regulatory authorities in certain of the countries in which we have introduced or plan to introduce our fertility treatments, if we or our clinic accounts are unable to obtain any required licenses or approvals in a particular country, if the application process takes longer than expected, or if additional licenses or approvals are required to commercialize the treatment on a large scale, then our introduction of our fertility treatments in such countries may be delayed, we may incur additional expenses, and we may determine not to provide the treatment in such countries.\nIt is unclear what regulatory pathway FDA will ultimately require for the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment or any other potential fertility treatments we may develop.\nIn 2012, we commenced a clinical study of the AUGMENT treatment in the United States. We did so without an IND on the basis of our conclusion that FDA would regulate the AUGMENT treatment as a section 361 HCT/P. On September 6, 2013, however, we received an \"untitled\" letter from the FDA questioning the status of the AUGMENT treatment as a section 361 HCT/P and advising us to file an IND.\nWe are scheduled to speak with the FDA in the first half of 2017 as part of our ongoing exploration of potential entry into the U.S. market for our fertility treatments. We believe that the AUGMENT treatment meets the regulatory definition of a section 361 HCT/P or is a procedure that can be performed as part of the practice of medicine - and in either case, is exempt from pre-market approval. The AUGMENT treatment involves isolation of mitochondria from egg precursor cells, and injection of those mitochondria into the same woman's egg, which we believe constitutes minimal manipulation of both the mitochondria and the egg. We believe the AUGMENT treatment involves only homologous use, does not combine the oocyte with an article that raises now safety concerns, and involves tissues for reproductive use. We therefore believe that the AUGMENT treatment meets all four of the criteria for a section 361 HCT/P set forth in FDA's regulation. If FDA ultimately agrees with our conclusions, the AUGMENT treatment will not be required to conduct clinical trials pursuant to an IND, nor will it be required to seek FDA pre-market review and approval of an NDA or BLA. However, both the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and our potential fertility treatments constitute new technologies, the proper regulatory characterization of which likely constitute matters of first impression for FDA. Particularly because the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and our potential fertility treatments are intended to result in the creation of human life, there can be no assurance that FDA will agree with our views as to the proper regulatory characterization of the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment or any of our potential fertility treatments. FDA may conclude that the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and/or potential fertility treatments constitute drugs, biologics, or medical devices. If FDA makes such a determination for AUGMENT, the OvaPrime treatment or any of our potential fertility treatments, we may be required to conduct clinical trials under an IND (or investigational device exemption for a medical device) and seek FDA pre-market\nreview and approval of an NDA or BLA (or premarket approval for a medical device). In that event, we may abandon pursuing that potential fertility treatment in the United States, or suffer significant delays and expense seeking to obtain any necessary approval.\nEven if the FDA regulates the AUGMENT treatment as a section 361 HCT/P, we must still generate adequate substantiation for any claims made in our marketing of the AUGMENT treatment before we commercialize it in the United States. Failure to establish such adequate substantiation in the opinion of federal or state authorities or equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities could substantially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we ultimately do not need to submit the AUGMENT treatment to the FDA for preapproval due to the FDA regulating the treatment as a section 361 HCT/P, we still must generate adequate substantiation for claims we make in our marketing materials. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the states retain jurisdiction over the marketing of products for which advertising and promotion are not regulated by the FDA, and require certain standards of evidence to support claims made in marketing materials. Many countries outside of the United States have similar regulatory authorities that regulate the marketing of products. We intend to generate such adequate substantiation for any claims we make about the AUGMENT treatment. If, however, after we commence marketing of the AUGMENT treatment in the United States, the FTC or one or more states or foreign authorities conclude that we lack adequate substantiation for our claims, we may be subject to significant penalties or may be forced to alter or cease our marketing of the AUGMENT treatment in one or more jurisdictions. Any of this could materially harm our business. In addition, if our promotion of the AUGMENT treatment suggests that the AUGMENT treatment is intended for uses that are not consistent with a section 361 HCT/P, the FDA or equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities might consider the potential fertility treatment to be a new drug or biologic. We will therefore be limited in the promotional claims that we could make about the AUGMENT treatment.\nProcedures such as IVF, as well as companies that manufacture and store cells and tissues, are the subject of standards and recommendations by national non-governmental bodies. Failure to comply with these standards could harm our commercial prospects or subject us to government sanctions.\nVarious countries where we are seeking or may seek to introduce our fertility treatments have standards set by regulatory authorities and/or non-governmental bodies that govern IVF procedures and the procurement, storage and processing of gametes and embryos for use in IVF procedures. In the UK, for example, the HFEA has adopted a Code of Practice with which licensed IVF clinics are obliged to comply, as well as supplementary guidance documents. Similarly, the UK's Association of Clinical Embryologists has adopted a series of best practice guidelines for its members. Even where these standards are voluntary, if we, or third parties that we work with, including IVF clinics, fail to comply with these standards, our commercial prospects could be harmed because patients may prefer to use the services and potential fertility treatments of companies that meet these standards. Similarly, physicians or IVF clinics may be less likely to endorse or use procedures or potential fertility treatments that fail to comply with such standards.\nNumerous states place restrictions on the operation of facilities and laboratories that recover, test, process, manufacture, store or dispose of certain cells and tissues. If we do not comply with such state regulations, as well as potential local regulations, we could be subject to significant sanctions.\nVarious states, including New York, California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Texas, Massachusetts and others, impose requirements on facilities and laboratories that recover, test, process, manufacture, store or dispose of certain cells and tissues. These requirements can have significant geographic reach. In Maryland, for example, the permit requirements applicable to tissue banks, including reproductive tissue banks, apply not only to tissue banks located in Maryland, but also those tissue banks located outside of the state that are represented or serviced in Maryland. In some cases, the requirements imposed by states, such as record keeping and testing requirements, may be more stringent than those imposed by the FDA. If we begin commercialization of our fertility treatments in the United States, we will have to comply with these state requirements. Failure to comply with these state requirements could subject us to significant sanctions.\nWe will not be able to sell any potential fertility treatment that is regulated as a medical device without obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances or approvals.\nSome regions or countries may determine that certain of our potential fertility treatments, or certain aspects of such treatments, such as the innovative culture media solution that we are planning to develop, should be regulated as medical devices. In such cases, we will need to seek approval or clearance from the appropriate regulatory authorities in such countries.\nIn the EU, for example, we will need to complete a conformity assessment procedure, to demonstrate that our fertility treatments conform to the essential requirements set out in EU law, and only then may we apply the CE mark to the products, which would allow the products to be marketed throughout the EU. In other countries, such products may be subject to pre-market review and approval by regulatory authorities or some other form of regulatory clearance. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the necessary conformity assessment procedures or obtain the necessary regulatory clearances of pre-\nmarket approvals of these medical devices. In addition, any modifications to medical devices that we successfully bring to market, if any, may require new conformity assessment procedures, regulatory clearances or pre-market approvals. Marketing a medical device without the necessary CE mark, clearance or approval could result in a warning letter, fines, injunctions, product seizures or other civil or criminal penalties. Delays in our receipt of CE marking, regulatory clearance or pre-market approval will cause delays in our ability to sell our potential fertility treatments, which will have a negative effect on our ability to generate and grow revenues.\nIn addition to the challenges associated with obtaining any necessary marketing approvals in international jurisdictions, economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales.\nWe are currently subject to risks associated with doing business internationally as a result of our commercialization of the AUGMENT treatment and the clinical development of the OvaPrime treatment outside of the United States. If we succeed in commercializing internationally, then our business will be subject to additional risks associated with doing business internationally. For example, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ndiffering business practices associated with foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, including compliance with labor laws and changes in those laws;\n\u2022\ndiffering protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection; and\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.\nWe currently have a limited international infrastructure including, without limitation, sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Establishing and expanding commercial activities and complying with laws in foreign jurisdictions may be costly and could disrupt our operations.\nEven if our fertility treatments are not subject to pre-market review and approval, they may be subject to certain ongoing regulation in some regions. We could be subject to significant civil or criminal penalties if we fail to comply with these requirements, and we may be unable to commercialize our potential fertility treatments.\nIf regulatory authorities allow our fertility treatments to be offered to patients in any of the countries we seek to access, we will still be subject to numerous post-market requirements. Post-marketing requirements applicable to such products vary by region and by country. For example, in the United States, section 361 HCT/Ps are subject to several regulatory requirements, including those related to registration and listing, record keeping, labeling, cGTPs, donor eligibility and other activities. HCT/Ps that do not meet the definition of a section 361 HCT/P and, therefore, are approved via an NDA or BLA, are also subject to these and additional ongoing obligations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions, we could be subject to warning letters, product seizures, injunctions or civil and criminal penalties.\nMoreover, even if the FDA or equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities allow our fertility treatments to be marketed without pre-market approval, the regulatory authorities could still seek to take enforcement action, which could include serving a written order that an HCT/P be recalled or destroyed, taking possession of the HCT/P, requiring cessation of manufacturing, or otherwise seeking to withdraw the potential fertility treatment from the market for a variety of reasons, including if the regulatory authority develops concerns regarding the safety of the potential fertility treatment or its manufacturing process\nAny fertility treatment for which we are required to obtain marketing approval, and for which we obtain such marketing approval, will be subject to continuing regulation after approval. We may be subject to significant penalties if we fail to comply with these requirements.\nAny potential fertility treatment, including any potential fertility treatment developed by our OvaXon joint venture, for which we obtain approval or clearance of an application for marketing authorization, will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA or equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities. Specific requirements will vary by country and/or region. In general, however, such requirements will include those relating to, among other things, submission of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing, manufacturing, packaging, quality control, storage, distribution, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, labeling, advertising and promotional activities, distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval or clearance of a potential fertility\ntreatment is granted, the approval or clearance may be subject to limitations on the uses for which the potential fertility treatment may be marketed, be subject to restrictions on distribution or use, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing to further evaluate the safety or efficacy of the potential fertility treatment. The FDA and equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, biologics and medical devices to ensure such products are marketed only for the approved indications or cleared uses and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and if we market our potential fertility treatments for uses other than for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our potential fertility treatments, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distribution or use of potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters from the FDA or equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of potential fertility treatments from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nrecall of potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure;\n\u2022\ninjunctions; or\n\u2022\nthe imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIt is unlikely that third party payors will cover or reimburse for the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment, the AUGMENT treatment, or other future potential fertility treatments and services, and many patients may be unable to afford them.\nMany third party payors, both in the United States and foreign countries, including national health services or government funded insurance programs as well as private payors, place significant restrictions on coverage and reimbursement for IVF and other ART procedures. Those restrictions may include limits on the types of procedures covered, limits on the number of procedures covered and overall annual or lifetime dollar limits on reimbursement for IVF and other ART procedures. As a result, we believe very few third party payors, either in the United States or outside the United States, will reimburse for the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment, the AUGMENT treatment, or other future potential fertility treatments and services. Thus, it is likely that IVF clinics and physicians will be able to use the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment, the AUGMENT treatment, and other future potential fertility treatments and services only if the patient can afford and is willing to pay out-of-pocket. The cost of the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment and other future potential fertility treatments and services may be beyond the means of many patients. This may limit the size of the market and prices charged for the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment or other future potential fertility treatments and services and, thereby, limit our future revenues.\nEven in those limited situations in which government or private payors may cover the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment or other future potential fertility treatments and services, cost containment pressures may later cause these third party payors to adopt strategies designed to limit the amount of reimbursement paid to IVF clinics and physicians, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nreducing reimbursement rates;\n\u2022\nchallenging the prices charged for medical potential fertility treatments or services;\n\u2022\nfurther limiting potential fertility treatments and services covered;\n\u2022\nchallenging whether potential fertility treatments or services are medically necessary;\n\u2022\ntaking measures to limit utilization of potential fertility treatments and services;\n\u2022\nnegotiating prospective or discounted contract pricing;\n\u2022\nadopting capitation strategies; and\n\u2022\nseeking competitive bids.\nAdditionally, in those limited situations where ART procedures such as IVF are available to disabled patients of childbearing age enrolled in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, the covered services and potential fertility treatments may be subject to changes in coverage and reimbursement rules and procedures, including retroactive rate adjustments. These contingencies could even further decrease the range of potential fertility treatments and services covered by such programs or the reimbursement rates paid directly or indirectly for such potential fertility treatments and services. Such changes could further limit our ability to sell our potential fertility treatments, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nIn March 2010, Congress enacted healthcare reform legislation known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act has substantially changed the way that healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the delivery and financing of healthcare in the United States. The Affordable Care Act contains provisions that, among other things, govern enrollment in federal healthcare programs, effect reimbursement changes, encourage use of comparative effectiveness research in healthcare decision making and enhance fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement. The Affordable Care Act imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, which could include our potential fertility treatments, if the FDA regulates those treatments as a biologic. The fee, which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, is based on the manufacturer's market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics, excluding orphan drugs, to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. In addition, the law subjects most medical devices to a 2.3% excise tax, beginning on January 1, 2013. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, it is also possible that the Affordable Care Act will be repealed and/or replaced, given recent changes in the federal administration in the United States. We are unable at this time to determine the outcome or impact on us of this uncertainty.\nThe reimbursement process for products and procedures outside the United States generally is subject to risks, like those associated with reimbursement in the United States, including the risk that it is unlikely that third party payors will cover or reimburse the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment or other future potential fertility treatments and services. Many national health services and third party payors in the EU already place coverage and reimbursement limits on ART procedures, including IVF, and may impose even greater limits in the future. In many EU member states medicinal products and medical devices are subject to formal pricing and reimbursement approvals before they can be reimbursed by national health services or government-funded insurance schemes. Reimbursement may be conditional on the agreement by the seller not to sell the product above a fixed price in that country, or the national authority may unilaterally establish a reimbursement price in connection with the inclusion of the product on a list of reimbursable products.\nThe likelihood that many third party payors will refuse to cover and reimburse for the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment and other future potential fertility treatments and services and that many patients will be unable to afford to pay for them out of pocket may reduce the demand for, or the price of, the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment and other future potential fertility treatments and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Additional legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future, and could adversely affect the revenues generated from the sale of our potential fertility treatments.\nSeveral states and certain foreign countries have enacted legislation that may hamper the ability of IVF clinics and physicians to pass through the cost of our potential fertility treatments to patients or third party payors.\nSeveral states, including California and New York, and certain foreign countries require direct billing of laboratory or pathology services, prohibit physicians from marking up the cost of laboratory or pathology services when they pass these costs on to patients or other payors or require that physicians disclose to patients what they actually paid to obtain laboratory or pathology services. Additionally, the federal government has enacted regulations limiting the Medicare reimbursement available to physicians who contract out the technical component of certain laboratory and pathology procedures.\nTo the extent that the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaTure treatment, the OvaPrime treatment or other future potential fertility treatments or services are treated as laboratory or pathology services for purposes of reimbursement, these laws may make it difficult for us to market those potential fertility treatments and services to IVF clinics and physicians in some states\nand may also require us to restructure our business model before we can expand into certain markets. To the extent that our IVF clinic and physician customer base anticipates seeking Medicare reimbursement, these laws may require a comprehensive restructuring of our business model, and therefore adversely impact our ability to market our potential fertility treatments. Any additional legislation or regulation in this area could also adversely affect our ability to market our potential fertility treatments.\nEven though we anticipate very limited third party coverage and reimbursement for the OvaTure treatment, OvaPrime treatment, AUGMENT treatment and our future potential fertility treatments and services, our future arrangements with third party payors and IVF clinics and physicians may be subject to foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nEven though we anticipate very limited third party coverage and reimbursement, including from federal healthcare programs, for any of our potential fertility treatments and services, our future arrangements with third party payors and IVF clinics and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment and other future potential fertility treatments and services for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations that may be applicable to our business include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal Stark law prohibits physicians from referring patients to hospitals, laboratories, and other types of entities in which they or their immediate family members have a financial interest, if the referral is for a select list of Medicare or Medicaid-covered services, including most clinical laboratory services, and also prohibits entities that furnish the covered services subsequent to a prohibited referral from billing Medicare or Medicaid for the services provided and from receiving payment from a federal healthcare program for those services;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, often through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for failure to safeguard the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and for executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare program;\n\u2022\nthe federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the U.S. government, including in connection with the delivery of or payment for federally reimbursed healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe federal transparency requirements under the \"sunshine\" provisions of the Affordable Care Act require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests;\n\u2022\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and\n\u2022\nanalogous foreign laws and regulations, such as anti-bribery laws and laws governing the promotion of medicinal products or medical devices, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and interactions with physicians in countries outside the United States.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the IVF clinics or physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nEven the assertion of a violation under any of these provisions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any such assertion would likely trigger an investigation of our business or executives that could cause us to incur substantial costs and result in significant liabilities or penalties, as well as damage to our reputation.\nLaws and regulations governing international operations, including the FCPA, may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain potential fertility treatments outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nWe have active operations outside of the United States, and we must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to our business operations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the U.S. Department of Justice. The SEC is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the biotechnology industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical studies and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions.\nWe may have obligations under our contracts with IVF clinics and physicians or other healthcare providers to protect the privacy of patient health information.\nIn the course of performing our business, we will obtain, from time to time, confidential patient health information. For example, we may learn patient names and be exposed to confidential patient health information when we provide training on the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment and other future potential fertility treatments and services to the staff at IVF clinics and physicians' offices. United States federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, in particular individually identifiable information, and restrict the use and disclosure of that information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgated health information and privacy and security rules under HIPAA. At this time, we are not a HIPAA covered entity. However, our current and future business associate or other confidentiality agreements with covered entities contain commitments to protect the privacy and security of patients' health information and, in some instances, may require us to indemnify the covered entity for any claim, liability, damage, cost or expense arising out of or in connection with a breach of the agreement by us. If we were to violate one of these agreements, we could lose customers and be exposed to liability or our reputation and business could be harmed. In addition, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted in February 2009, expands the HIPAA privacy and security rules, including imposing many of the requirements of those rules directly on business associates and making business associates directly subject to HIPAA civil and criminal enforcement provisions and associated penalties. We may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security requirements. Our failure to comply may result in criminal and civil liability.\nOther federal and state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information, as well as certain financial information, which could affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Such laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, in particular those laws that afford greater protection to the individual than does HIPAA or cover different subject matter. Such state laws typically have their own penalty provisions, which could be applied in the event of an unlawful action affecting health information.\nIn the member states of the EU and many other countries, we will be subject to similar or more stringent data privacy laws, such as those implementing the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, that require us to protect all individually identifiable information and restrict the use, disclosure and onward transfer of that information. Such national laws typically have their own civil or criminal enforcement provisions and associated penalties. We may incur costs in complying with the applicable privacy and security requirements, which may include registration with the national data protection authorities.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing of Our Potential Fertility Treatments\nWe currently rely on on-site manufacturing at or near to the IVF clinics in which the AUGMENT treatment is offered. We may rely on third parties for the manufacture of our potential fertility treatments for development and commercialization to the extent that we do not rely on on-site manufacturing. This reliance on third parties may increase the risk of failing to provide manufacturing capacity to meet our potential fertility treatments at an acceptable cost. Lack of direct control of manufacturing capacity, costs and regulatory compliance could delay, prevent or impair our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe currently manufacture on-site or near to international IVF clinics where we have introduced commercial AUGMENT treatments and clinical programs for our OvaPrime treatment using our own equipment and employees. We entered into a master services agreement with a third party manufacturer to execute a technology transfer program to potentially provide services for the manufacture of the AUGMENT and OvaPrime treatments in the event that we decide to outsource our manufacturing operations for clinic or commercial activities. In addition, if we utilize centralized off-site manufacturing, we may also enter into similar master service agreements with other third party manufacturers to perform the processing steps for our AUGMENT and OvaPrime treatments. While we believe that our third party manufacturer has the capabilities to undertake the manufacturing activities in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that they will be able to do so successfully or be capable of maintaining consistent quality standards. We seek to maintain high standards by working with high quality clinics, providing our own manufacturing equipment and personnel, and conducting regular training and quality audits, however there can be no assurance that such clinics will maintain consistent quality standards for activities outside of our control.\nReliance on third party manufacturers and laboratories entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for establishment of and maintenance of its redundancy and disaster recovery plans\n\u2022\npossible changes by third party manufacturers and laboratories of business strategies or operating models that are incongruent with maintaining our relationship with such third parties;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing or service agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nthe possible delay in obtaining, interruption of or withdrawal of required licenses;\n\u2022\nthe possible delay, disruption or termination of service due to sanctions, regulations, or travel bans imposed by the site of third party manufacturer to patients or clinics outside the region where the manufacture is located;\n\u2022\nthe possible disruption or availability of supplies, equipment, or properly qualified and trained staff;\n\u2022\nthe possible exposure of trade secrets to unintended parties; and\n\u2022\nthe possible interruption, or termination, or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nWe may wish to utilize third party manufacturers or third party collaborators for the manufacture of our other potential fertility treatments for preclinical testing, clinical trials and for commercial supply. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms.\nWhile we have identified and may continue to identify contractors with suitable regulatory experience and expertise, they may not be able to comply with cGTP regulations or similar regulatory requirements expected from global regulatory bodies in countries where we plan to offer our fertility treatments. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers and service providers could delay clinical development or marketing approval or adversely affect or impede commercial sales. Our failure, or the failure of our third party manufacturers and service providers, to comply with applicable regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our potential fertility treatments and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may compete with other companies for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGTP and cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. It is possible that some of these manufacturers have agreements with our competitors that limit or restrict their ability to contract with us, further narrowing the number of manufacturers that are available to us.\nWe do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second contract manufacturing supplier for the AUGMENT treatment or the OvaPrime treatment. Although we believe that there are other potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture our potential fertility treatments, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nOur potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our potential fertility treatments, were we could cease relying on on-site manufacturing, may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize the AUGMENT and OvaPrime treatments or any future potential fertility treatments that we seek to market on a timely and competitive basis.\nIn the future, we may build and equip a cGTP-compliant facility for the processing of the AUGMENT treatment. Constructing and equipping such a facility in compliance with regulatory requirements will be time consuming and expensive.\nIn the future, we may lease, build and equip a cGTP-compliant facility for the processing of the AUGMENT and OvaPrime treatment. We believe that such a facility may be important to our ability to meet demand for these on a cost-effective basis. The leasing, build-out and equipping of this facility will require substantial capital expenditures. In addition, it will be costly and time consuming to recruit necessary additional personnel for the operation out of the facility. We may continue to rely on on-site or third party manufacturing during the build-out of the facility and possibly retain third party manufacturing along with our own cGTP-compliant facility for a period of time to ensure uninterrupted service which will require additional capital.\nFurthermore, we do not have experience running a manufacturing facility, which includes international tissue shipping and handling to meet local regulations. There is a risk that failure to maintain adequate quality controls and assurance for AUGMENT and OvaPrime processing facilities, associated support services and maintenance of equipment could impact the quality of our treatments, in terms of effectiveness and patient safety, which could lead to regulatory actions that could adversely impact commercialization of our fertility treatment business.\nThere is no assurance that we will secure necessary permits and license to build and equip a cGTP-compliant facility in the intended country, nor manufacture commercial products, nor do we currently have funding available for any of these\npurposes. If we are unable to successfully construct and equip a commercial manufacturing facility in compliance with regulatory requirements, and hire additional necessary personnel appropriately, our revenues from the AUGMENT treatment, and the profitability of such revenues, may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if treatment volumes projected to initiate the build of such a facility do not materialize, the cost burden on AUGMENT and OvaPrime treatments could be significantly increased and could negatively impact the profitability of the business.\nLack of coordination internally among our employees and externally with physicians, IVF clinics and third party suppliers and carriers could result in processing and manufacturing difficulties, regulatory enforcement actions, disruptions or delays and cause us to have insufficient resources to meet any of the AUGMENT treatment site's requirements or potential commercial requirements.\nProviding the AUGMENT treatment to patients requires coordination internally among our employees and externally with physicians, IVF clinics and third party suppliers and carriers. For example, a patient's physician or clinical site will need to coordinate with us to ship a patient's ovarian biopsy sample to the cGTP-compliant facility responsible for the next steps in the AUGMENT treatment process and we will need to coordinate with them to ship treatment products, the patient's egg precursor cells or mitochondria, to the appropriate clinic or physician. Such coordination involves a number of risks that may lead to failures or delays in processing and providing our AUGMENT treatments, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the timely shipping of patient-specific materials to us, or shipping of our potential fertility treatments to the treating physicians due to errors by third party carriers, transportation restrictions or delays or other reasons\n\u2022\ndestruction of, loss of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our potential fertility treatments during the shipping process due to improper handling by third party carriers, hospitals, physicians\n\u2022\ndestruction of, loss of, or damage to, patient-specific materials during any of the tissue or cell processing steps required for egg precursor cell isolation and selection of the patient-specific mitochondria\n\u2022\ndestruction of, loss of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our potential fertility treatments during storage at our facilities\n\u2022\ndestruction of, loss of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our potential fertility treatments stored at clinical and future commercial sites due to improper handling or holding by clinicians, hospitals or physicians\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain precise patient records sufficient to ensure the chain of custody procedures are followed, either by clinicians, hospital, physicians, carriers or by ourselves\n\u2022\nfailure to ensure adequate quality control and assurances in the AUGMENT treatment process as we increase production quantities\n\u2022\nfailure to establish or maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity, whether through third party manufacturers or internally, and\n\u2022\nfailure to establish or maintain sufficient manufacturing supplies, whether through third party manufacturers or internally.\nIf we are unable to coordinate appropriately, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our clinical and commercialization objectives. We, or third parties, could face regulatory action as a result of the failure to comply with cGTPs or other applicable rules. Some or all of these risks may also be applicable to the OvaTure treatment and any other future potential fertility treatments.\nWe are reliant on single sourcing of materials and equipment for our potential fertility treatments which could put us at risk for continuity of supply in the event that any of our suppliers are unable to supply us in part or in full\nWe also are reliant on single sourcing for the majority of our raw materials, consumables and processing equipment, including but not limited to our proprietary antibody and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting equipment. At this point in time we do not have the capacity or intent to source alternative or secondary suppliers of materials or processing equipment.\nThere is a risk that if we are required to find alternative suppliers, for whatever reason, this could delay supply of our fertility treatments for clinical or commercial purposes and could add an additional, unplanned financial burden on the company. Qualification of alternative suppliers could be a costly and timely process that would need to be driven through our Quality Management System to confirm and document that all the testing and validation activities are in place to ensure that like-for-like changes do not impact the performance and safety of our potential fertility treatments.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe currently rely and will in the future rely on selected international IVF clinics to continue to conduct clinical trials, commercialize, gain experience and generate data on the AUGMENT treatment and the OvaPrime treatment. We will also rely on other third parties to conduct clinical trials for our fertility treatments. Such third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet volume expectations, quality standards or deadlines for the completion of such studies or trials.\nOur reliance on these third parties for providing our potential fertility treatments and for clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities.\nWe will remain responsible for ensuring that the AUGMENT treatment and the OvaPrime treatment are introduced with consistent and high quality standards. Moreover, the FDA and equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities will require us to comply with GCPs with respect to any clinical trials for any of our potential fertility conducted in connection with a submission to the FDA or Foreign Regulatory Authorities, including an IND or equivalent application, and will require that we record and report clinical trial results to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights and safety are protected. We will also be required to register ongoing FDA-regulated clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nOur reliance on these third parties, including IVF clinics, for providing the AUGMENT treatment and OvaPrime treatment and conducting clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, provide our potential fertility treatments at all or as requested, conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols or maintain consistent quality standards, in the case of contract manufacturing and clinics manufacturing our fertility treatments on site, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our potential fertility treatments and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our potential fertility treatments. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, or have their on IVF practices and could devote more of their resources to such other entities or their own business at the expense of expending sufficient resources on our clinical development activities.\nWe expect to depend on collaborations with third parties, particularly Intrexon, for the development and commercialization of our potential fertility treatments. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these potential fertility treatments.\nIn December 2013, we established a collaboration with Intrexon to accelerate development of the OvaTure treatment, and entered into the OvaXon joint venture with Intrexon to create new applications to prevent inherited diseases for human and animal health. Our ability to reach our goals for the development of bovine and human OvaTure depend significantly upon Intrexon. Further, we may commercialize the AUGMENT treatment and the OvaPrime treatment ourselves in some markets and to collaborate with third parties to commercialize the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and any future potential fertility treatments in other markets. In addition, we may seek partners for further development and commercialization of our other potential fertility treatments. These collaborations could take the form of license, distribution, sales representative, joint venture, sponsored research, co-promotion or other arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, other commercial entities and academic and other institutions.\nIn any such arrangements with third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that such collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our potential fertility treatments. Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of potential fertility treatments in the most efficient manner, or at all. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on, among other things, our collaborators' successful performance of the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our potential fertility treatments would pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations and could devote fewer resources to our potential fertility treatments than we expect them to;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more other potential fertility treatments may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our potential fertility treatments or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the\ncollaborator's strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial, abandon a potential fertility treatment or repeat or conduct new clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, potential fertility treatments that compete directly or indirectly with our potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may create intellectual property that we need to in-license, may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our potential fertility treatments or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management's attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable potential fertility treatments.\nIf we are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur potential fertility treatment development programs and the potential commercialization of such treatments will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of some of our potential fertility treatments. For example, we currently intend to seek to collaborate with third parties to commercialize the AUGMENT treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and other potential fertility treatments we successfully develop.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of our clinical trials, if any, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or the availability of an exemption for the need or pre-marketing review or approval of our potential fertility treatment, the potential market for such potential fertility treatment, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering the potential fertility treatment to patients, the potential and relative cost of competing fertility treatments, uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative potential fertility treatments or technologies for similar indications or conditions that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our potential fertility treatment. We may also be restricted under existing license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. In addition, there have been a significant number of business combinations among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and manage. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to obtain a collaborator for a particular program, we may have to curtail the development of such program or of one or more of our other development programs, delay the potential commercialization of such program, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities for the program or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities for the program at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our potential fertility treatments or bring these potential fertility treatments to market and generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe have an exclusive license from MGH with respect to the intellectual property that forms the basis of our business. The license under MGH-owned patent rights and know-how is for human female fertility, the treatment or prevention of inherited (including mitochondrial) diseases or defects in all animals, including humans, assisted and/or artificial reproductive technology in all non-human animals, and the artificial creation of food, research animals and/or animal products; and the license under the MGH and Harvard co-owned patent right is for ex-vivo human female fertility treatments. Our existing MGH\nlicense agreement and another agreement granting rights impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various obligations on us, including diligence, milestone payments, royalty payments, insurance and other obligations. For example, under our license agreement with MGH, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make available to the public licensed fertility treatments and to satisfy specified diligence milestones within specified timeframes. If we fail to comply with our obligations under this or other of our license agreements, our licensors may have the right to terminate our licenses, in which event we might not be able to market potential fertility treatments that are covered by these agreements, or to convert our licenses to non-exclusive licenses, which could materially adversely affect the value of the potential fertility treatments we developed under the license agreements. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, or to cease commercialization of licensed technology and potential fertility treatments. This could materially adversely affect our business, particularly in the case of our license from MGH.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and potential fertility treatments, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or potential fertility treatments that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and potential fertility treatments similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and potential fertility treatments may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and potential fertility treatments. We and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications within the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and potential fertility treatments that are important to our business. The process of obtaining patent protection is uncertain, and we and our licensors may not succeed in obtaining the patent protection for our novel technologies and potential fertility treatments that we seek. If we and our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection of sufficient scope for our technology and potential fertility treatments, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and potential fertility treatments similar or identical to ours, and in that case our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and potential fertility treatments may be adversely affected. This risk is greater outside the United States where some aspects of our in-licensed intellectual property are not protected by patents. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nMoreover, under our license agreement with MGH, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of the licensed patent applications, to defend the validity and enforceability of the licensed patents against challenges by third parties, or to maintain the licensed patents covering our technology or potential fertility treatments. This could also be the case under any other license agreements we enter into in the future. Therefore, we rely on MGH, and may rely on other licensors in the future, to file, defend and maintain patents that are important to our business. The failure of MGH or other licensors to successfully prosecute, defend and maintain these patents and patent applications in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and potential fertility treatments.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors' patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors' pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or potential fertility treatments or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and potential fertility treatments. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nPublications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nUnder the America Invents Act enacted in September 2011, the United States moved to a first inventor to file system in March 2013. Outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. We may become involved in patent litigation or reexamination, post-grant review, opposition, derivation or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or potential fertility treatments and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize potential fertility treatments without infringing third party patent rights.\nMoreover, in recent years, the Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have rendered decisions in several patent cases such as Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad I), BRCA1- & BRCA2-Based Hereditary Cancer Test Patent Litig., (Myriad II), Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, in the Myriad I case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to naturally occurring substances are not patentable. We cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress, or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, may impact the value of our patents. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and patents that we may obtain in the future.\nIf the scope of the patent protection we or our licensors obtain is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to prevent others from developing and commercializing technology and potential fertility treatments similar or identical to ours.\nOur owned and licensed patents and any owned or licensed patent applications that issue as patents may not provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or potential fertility treatments in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to use and commercialize, or to stop or prevent others from using or commercializing, similar or identical technology and potential fertility treatments, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and potential fertility treatments. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new potential fertility treatments, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. For example, certain of the U.S. patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from MGH will expire in May 2025. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing potential fertility treatments similar or identical to ours.\nWe may be required to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our current and future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our potential fertility treatments and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our potential fertility treatments and technology, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our potential fertility treatments and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or treatment. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our potential fertility treatments or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have wrongfully appropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully appropriated, used or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not appropriate or use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have appropriated, used or disclosed intellectual property, including information forming the basis of patents and patent applications, trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel and our reputation may be harmed.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, such developments could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses, reduce the resources available for development activities and adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and potential fertility treatments, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. The protection available for trade secrets is particularly important with respect to our process for manufacturing the AUGMENT treatment, to the OvaTure treatment, the OvaPrime treatment and to our potential fertility treatments, which will involve significant unpatented know-how. Any appropriation of our know-how, by competing contract manufacturers, collaborators or otherwise, could harm our business and we could suffer financial loss. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such trade secrets, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our executive chair, to recruit a permanent chief executive officer, to retain other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Dr. Dipp, our executive chair, and Christophe Couturier, our chief financial officer, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Following the change in our corporate strategy announced in December 2016, we are also engaged in a search for a permanent chief executive officer. Although we have entered into employment arrangements with Dr. Dipp and Mr. Couturier providing for certain benefits, including severance in the event of a termination without cause, these arrangements do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors, including our scientific co-founders, may be employed by employers\nother than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our organizational changes and successfully adjusting our operations.\nAs we seek to transition from a company focused on in-licensing and research to a company capable of developing multiple potential fertility treatments and supporting commercial activities, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our therapeutic candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development and commercialization efforts and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe expect to expand our research and development and potentially in the future expand our sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of research and development, and potentially in the future, sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Our management team may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel.\nThe physical expansion of our operations may also lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business plans. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize fertility treatments will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company. Accordingly, any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nA breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nMany of our key business processes are facilitated by information technology systems. Information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack. Likewise, individuals authorized to access our information technology systems may pose a risk by exposing private or confidential data to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Associated with Our Capital Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nEven if an active trading market develops for our common stock, our stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe delay or failure to execute our plans for the OvaTure treatment, OvaPrime treatment or AUGMENT treatment;\n\u2022\nresults of preclinical testing or clinical trials of our potential fertility treatments, including the OvaTure treatment, or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our development programs;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive potential fertility treatments or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe success of our OvaXon joint venture with Intrexon;\n\u2022\nannouncements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, new potential fertility treatment introductions and commercial results;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our licensors or manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to discover, acquire or in-license additional potential fertility treatments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and other developments relating to our issued patents or patent applications or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors or other material litigation;\n\u2022\ndisagreement by the FDA or equivalent Foreign Regulatory Authorities regarding the regulatory pathway applicable to the OvaPrime treatment, the OvaTure treatment or the AUGMENT treatment;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States or other countries, particularly with respect to IVF procedures;\n\u2022\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our common stockholders' sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our common stockholders might otherwise receive a premium price for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and for nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions be effected at a duly called stockholders meeting;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a manner prescribed by the statute.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and our management continues to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public reporting company, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some other activities more time consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, because we are no longer an emerging growth company status under the Jumpstart our Business Startups (JOBS) Act enacted in April 2012, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our auditors as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Now that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we are no longer exempted from certain requirements, such as the independent registered public accounting firm attestation.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and compile the system and\nprocess documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 13883, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MLND"}
