RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results, business, financial condition and cash flows to differ from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements made herein because such statements speak only to the date they were made. We undertake no obligation or duty to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events. Also refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nOur business is subject to general economic, credit and business factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets, including recessionary economic cycles, such as the period from 2007 to 2009; changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels and in the availability of funding for their working capital; excess tractor capacity in comparison with shipping demand; and downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles.\nWe are also affected by recessionary economic cycles, such as the period from 2007 to 2009. Such economic conditions can decrease freight demand and increase the supply of tractors and trailers, thereby exerting downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization and may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the United States economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times, which risks we have experienced during prior recessionary periods, are as follows: reduction in overall freight levels, which may impair asset utilization; customers facing credit issues and cash flow problems that may lead to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships that could result in even lower freight demand and may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts; changing freight patterns as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between capacity and freight demand; customers bidding our freight or selecting competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower costs, in which case, we may be forced to lower rates or lose freight; accepting more freight from brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or incurrence of more non-revenue miles to obtain loads; and lack of access to current sources of credit or lack of lender access to capital, leading to an inability to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWe are subject to increases in costs and other events that are outside our control that could materially affect our results of operations. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, fuel and energy prices, taxes and interest rates, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, revenue equipment and related maintenance costs, and healthcare and other benefits for our employees. We could be affected by strikes or other work stoppages at our service centers or at customer, port, border, or other shipping locations. Changing impacts of regulatory measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity, decrease our operating revenue and profitability, and result in higher operating costs. In addition, declines in the resale value of revenue equipment can also affect our operating income and cash flows. From time-to-time, various federal, state or local taxes also increase, including taxes on fuels. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such increase applicable to us will be enacted, but such an increase could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nIn addition, we cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations, or how consumer confidence could be affected by actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, government efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete with other carriers.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. These factors include:\n\u2022\nWe compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment or greater capital resources, or other competitive advantages.\n\u2022\nMany of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced economic growth, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our margins, or maintain growth in our business.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers also operate their own private trucking fleets, and they may decide to transport more of their own freight.\n\u2022\nMany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.\n\u2022\nMany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some of our business to competitors.\n\u2022\nThe trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size, and we may have difficulty competing with these larger carriers.\n\u2022\nAdvances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments.\n\u2022\nCompetition from non-asset-based and other logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates.\n\u2022\nEconomies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us.\nWe have a recent history of net losses and may be unsuccessful in sustaining or increasing profitability.\nWe have generated a profit in only one of the last five years. Maintaining and improving profitability depends upon numerous factors, including the ability to increase average revenue per tractor, increase velocity, improve driver retention and control operating expenses. Despite recent results, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future. If we are unable to sustain our profitability, then our liquidity, financial position, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in implementing new management, operating procedures and cost savings initiatives.\nAs part of the long-term turnaround plan, we have implemented changes to the management team and structure, as well as operating procedures. These changes may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results. Additional training or different personnel may be required, which may result in additional expense, delays in obtaining results, or disruptions to operations. Some of these implemented changes include customer service and driver management changes and cost savings initiatives. These changes and initiatives may not improve our results of operations, including asset productivity, tractor utilization, driver retention and base revenue per mile. In addition, we may not be successful in achieving the expected savings in our cost structure, including the areas of insurance and claims, equipment maintenance, equipment operating costs, and fuel economy. In such event, our revenue, financial results, and ability to operate profitably could be negatively impacted. Further, our operating results may be negatively affected by a failure to further penetrate our existing customer base, cross-sell our services, pursue new customer opportunities, and manage the operations and expenses of our new or growing services.\nWe self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could significantly increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings.\nOur future insurance and claims expense could reduce our earnings and make our earnings more volatile. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses. We accrue amounts for liabilities based on our assessment of claims that arise and our insurance coverage for the periods in which the claims arise, and we evaluate and revise these accruals from time to time based on additional information. Due to our significant self-insured amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and the risk of being required to accrue or pay additional amounts if estimates are revised or claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed. Historically, we have had to adjust our reserves, and future significant adjustments may occur. Further, our self-insured retention levels could change and result in more volatility than in recent years.\nWe maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self-insure with licensed insurance carriers. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits will be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim was to exceed our coverage, we would bear the excess, in addition to other self-insured amounts. Our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we\ncould find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if these expenses increase, if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, if we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage, if we experience an increase in a number of claims, or if we have to increase our reserves.\nHealthcare legislation and inflationary cost increases also could negatively impact financial results by increasing annual employee healthcare costs going forward. We cannot presently determine the extent of the impact healthcare costs will have on our financial performance. In addition, rising healthcare costs could force us to make changes to existing benefits program, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur revolving credit agreement and other financing arrangements contain certain covenants, restrictions, and requirements, and we may be unable to comply with the covenants, restrictions, and requirements. A default could result in the acceleration of all or part of any outstanding indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.\nIn February 2015, we entered into a new senior secured revolving credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as agent (\u201cAgent\u201d). Contemporaneously with the funding of the Credit Facility, we paid off the obligations under our prior credit facility and terminated such facility. We also have other financing arrangements.\nThe Credit Facility contains a single springing financial covenant, which requires a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0. The financial covenant springs only in the event excess availability under the Credit Facility drops below 10% of the lenders\u2019 total commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain restrictions and covenants related to, among other things, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions, affiliate transactions, and other indebtedness. The Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, with the notable exclusion of any real estate or revenue equipment financed outside the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility includes usual and customary events of default for a facility of this nature and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, and the lenders\u2019 commitments may be terminated.\nIf we fail to comply with any of our financing arrangement covenants, restrictions, and requirements, we will be in default under the relevant agreement, which could cause cross-defaults under our other financing arrangements. In the event of any such default, if we failed to obtain replacement financing or amendments to, or waivers under, the applicable financing arrangements, existing lenders could cease to make further advances, could declare existing debt to be immediately due and payable, could fail to renew letters of credit, could impose significant restrictions and requirements on our operations, could institute foreclosure proceedings against collateralized assets or could impose significant fees and transaction costs. If acceleration occurs, it may be difficult or expensive to refinance the accelerated debt or the issuance of additional equity securities could dilute stock ownership. Even if new financing can be procured, more stringent borrowing terms could mean that credit is not available to us on acceptable terms. A default under these financing arrangements could cause a materially adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness and capital and operating lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our industry or business.\nAs a result of our level of debt, capital leases, operating leases, and encumbered assets, management believes:\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to adverse economic conditions and competitive pressures is heightened;\n\u2022\nwe will continue to be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to lease payments and repayment of debt, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry will be limited;\n\u2022\nprofitability is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates because some of our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates, and future borrowings and lease financing arrangements will be affected by any such fluctuations;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required to issue additional equity securities to raise funds, which would dilute the ownership position of our stockholders.\nOur financing obligations could negatively impact our future operations, ability to satisfy our capital needs, or ability to engage in other business activities. We also cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us when required or, if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could adversely affect profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or obtain financing on favorable terms.\nThe truckload industry is capital intensive, and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually. We except to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations, borrowings under the Credit Facility, proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment, and, to a lesser extent, capital and operating leases. Capital expenditures for revenue equipment are expected to increase from 2014, as we continue to replace and upgrade our existing fleet. We base our equipment purchase and replacement decisions on a number of factors, including new equipment prices, the used equipment market, demand for freight services, prevailing interest rates, technological improvements, regulatory changes, cost per mile, fuel efficiency, equipment durability, equipment specifications and driver comfort.\nIn the future, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain borrowing on favorable terms, we may be forced to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could materially and adversely affect profitability.\nWe depend on the proper functioning, availability, and security of our information and communication systems, and a systems failure or unavailability or a security breach could cause a significant disruption to and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the proper functioning, availability, and security of our information systems, including financial reporting and operating systems, in operating our business. These systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, but are still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses and similar events beyond our control. If the communication systems fail, otherwise become unavailable or experience a security breach, manually performing functions could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, to respond to customers\u2019 requests effectively, to maintain billing and other records reliably, to bill for services accurately or in a timely manner, to communicate internally and with drivers, customers, and vendors, and to prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. Business interruption insurance may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a catastrophe. Any system failure, upgrade complication, security breach or other system disruption could interrupt or delay operations, damage our reputation, impact our ability to manage our operations and report financial performance, and cause the loss of customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on existing and future business.\nWe are in the midst of a multi-year process to migrate our legacy mainframe platform and internally developed software applications to server-based platforms. We still have a few remaining systems to convert, and could experience delays, complications or additional costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We anticipate the legacy mainframe applications should be completely migrated to newer platforms by December 2015.\nDuring 2014, we began to host all of our production systems at a remote data center. This data center replicates all production data back to the data center at our headquarters, which protects our information in the event of a fire or other significant natural disasters. This redundant data center allows any system to be recovered within four hours of an incident. Although we attempt to reduce the risk of disruption to our business operations should a disaster occur through redundant computer systems and networks and backup systems, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective.\nWe receive and transmit confidential data with and among our customers, drivers, vendors, employees, and service providers in the normal course of business. Despite our implementation of secure transmission techniques, internal data security measures, and monitoring tools, our information and communication systems are vulnerable to security threats and breach attempts from both external and internal sources. Any such breach could result in disruption of communications with our customers, drivers, vendors, employees, and service providers and access, viewing, misappropriation, altering, or deleting information in our systems, including customer, driver, vendor, employee, and service provider information and our proprietary business information. A security breach could damage our business operations and reputation and could cause us to incur costs associated with repairing our systems, increased security, customer notifications, lost operating revenue, litigation, regulatory action, and reputational damage.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on business.\nWe generate a significant portion of our operating revenue from our major customers. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our major customers. Accordingly, in response to economic conditions, supply and demand in the industry, our performance, our customers\u2019 internal initiatives, or other factors, our customers may reduce or eliminate their use of our services, or threaten to do so to gain pricing or other concessions from us.\nEconomic conditions and capital markets may adversely affect our customers and their ability to remain solvent. Financial difficulties of our customers can negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, especially if these customers were to delay or default on payments. For some of our customers, we have entered into multi-year contracts, and the rates we charge may not remain advantageous. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nContinued management and key employee turnover or failure to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our executive management team, which has experienced significant changes in recent years. Continuing or unexpected turnover in key leadership positions may adversely impact our ability to manage our business efficiently and effectively, and such turnover can be disruptive and distracting to management, may lead to additional departures of existing personnel, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers to realize our goal of expanding our operations, improving our earnings consistency and positioning ourselves for long-term operating revenue growth.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe operate in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT, in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications, and our Mexican business activities are subject to operating authority granted by Secretaria de Communicaciones y Transportes. Company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing, driver safety performance and hours-of-service. Matters such as weight, equipment dimensions and exhaust emissions are also subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to exhaust emissions, drivers\u2019 hours-of-service, ergonomics, on-board reporting of operations, collective bargaining, security at ports, and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent, require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs we incur, or higher costs incurred by suppliers who pass the costs on to us, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Regulation section in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Form 10-K discusses in detail several proposed, pending and final regulations that could significantly affect our business and operations.\nCSA could adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, and our customer relationships.\nUnder CSA, drivers and fleets are evaluated and ranked based on certain safety-related standards. The methodology for determining a carrier\u2019s DOT safety rating has been expanded to include the on-road safety performance of the carrier\u2019s drivers. As a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for us, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to our peer firms, and our safety rating could be adversely impacted. We recruit and retain first-time drivers to be part of our fleet, and these drivers may have a higher likelihood of creating adverse safety events under CSA. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruitment by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, competition for drivers with favorable safety ratings may increase and thus could necessitate increases in driver-related compensation costs. Further, we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve our scores or as a result of those scores.\nWe have exceeded the established intervention thresholds under certain categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We have procedures in place in an attempt to address areas where we have exceeded the thresholds. However, we cannot assure you these measures will be effective.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel, hedging activities, the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments, surcharge collection and surcharge policies approved by customers may increase our costs of operation, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nFuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic, political, weather and other factors beyond our control, each of which may lead to an increase in the price of fuel. Fuel pricing is also affected by regional differences. Additionally, fuel pricing also can be affected by the rising demand in developing countries and could be adversely impacted by the use of crude oil and oil reserves for other purposes and diminished drilling activity. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, and accordingly, significant diesel fuel cost increases, shortages or supply disruptions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may use hedging contracts and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations. If we do enter into hedging contracts, we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements. In addition, in times of falling diesel fuel prices, including recently, our costs will not be reduced to the same extent they would have reduced had we not entered into the hedging contracts. Accordingly, in times of falling diesel fuel prices, our profitability may not increase to the extent it would have increased without the hedging contract.\nWe use a fuel surcharge program to recapture a portion of the increases in fuel prices over a base rate negotiated with our customers. The fuel surcharge program does not protect us from the full effect of increases in fuel prices. The terms of each customer\u2019s fuel surcharge program vary, and certain customers have sought to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge programs to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. A failure to improve our fuel price protection through these measures, increases in fuel prices, a shortage or rationing of diesel fuel, or significant payments under hedging arrangements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreases in driver compensation or difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability.\nLike many truckload carriers, from time to time we experience substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified professional drivers, including independent contractors. The trucking industry periodically experiences a shortage of qualified drivers, particularly during periods of economic expansion, in which alternative employment opportunities are more plentiful and freight demand increases, or during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing is limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment or for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Regulatory requirements, including CSA and hours-of-service, and an improved economy could further reduce the number of eligible drivers or force us to increase driver compensation to attract and retain drivers. Due to the shortage of qualified professional drivers and intense competition for drivers from other trucking companies, we expect to continue to face difficulty increasing the number of our drivers, including independent contractors. The compensation we offer our drivers and independent contractors is subject to market conditions, and, as market conditions change, we may find it necessary to increase driver and independent contractor compensation in future periods. In addition, we and our industry suffer from a high driver turnover rate. The high driver turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers to operate existing revenue equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could be required to, among other things, adjust our compensation packages, increase the number of tractors without drivers, or operate with fewer tractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nIf our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities have asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to heighten the penalties of companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this\ninitiative. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If our independent contractors are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain above-ground bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at four of our facilities and one leased facility has below-ground bulk fuel storage tanks. A small percentage of our freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects us to a wide array of regulations. Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on us. Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of climate-change proposals and new greenhouse gas regulations that could increase the cost of new tractors, impair productivity and increase our operating expenses. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe Regulation section in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Form 10-K discusses in detail several proposed, pending and final regulations that could significantly affect our business and operations.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with doing business internationally, our operating revenue and profitability may suffer.\nA component of our operations is the business we conduct in Mexico, and to a lesser extent Canada, and we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of Mexico and Canada, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States export and import laws, and social, political, and economic instability. Additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties by foreign governments, are present but largely mitigated by the terms of NAFTA.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather affect our operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and more equipment repairs. We could also suffer short-term impacts from weather-related events such as hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms and floods that could make our results of operations more volatile.\nIncreased prices, reduced productivity and scarcity of financing for new revenue equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors. Prices have increased and may continue to increase, due in part to government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines and the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers. In addition, we have recently equipped our tractors with safety, aerodynamics, and other options that increase the price of new tractors. More restrictive EPA emissions standards have required vendors to introduce new engines. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, lower fuel mileage, and increase operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations as the regulations become effective.\nWe have a combination of agreements and non-binding statements of indicative trade values covering the terms of trade-in commitments from our primary equipment vendors for disposal of a portion of our revenue equipment. From time to time, prices we expect to receive under these arrangements may be higher than the prices we would receive in the open market. We may suffer a financial loss upon disposition of our equipment if these vendors refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements, if we do not enter into definitive agreements consistent with the indicative trade values, if we fail to or are unable to enter into similar arrangements in the future, or if we do not purchase the number of replacement units from the vendors required for such trade-ins.\nThe Regulation section in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Form 10-K discusses in detail several proposed, pending and final regulations that could significantly affect our business and operations.\nFluctuations in the prices of used revenue equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nA decreased demand for used revenue equipment could adversely affect us and our operating results. We rely on the sale and trade-in of used revenue equipment to partially offset the cost of new revenue equipment. The market demand for used equipment is difficult to forecast and, although our equipment disposal schedule may fluctuate, we currently expect the market demand and gains on disposal in 2015 to be comparable to demand experienced in 2014. When the used equipment market is weak, it may increase our net capital expenditures for new revenue equipment, decrease our gains on sale of revenue equipment (or create a loss on sale of revenue equipment), or increase our maintenance costs if we decide to extend the use of revenue equipment in a depressed market, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe depend on third parties, particularly in our brokerage and rail intermodal businesses, and service instability from these providers could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer brokerage or rail intermodal services, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and customer relationships.\nOur brokerage business is dependent upon the services of third-party capacity providers, including other truckload carriers. For this business, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight, and do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight. This reliance could also cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. These third-party providers seek other freight opportunities and may require increased compensation in times of improved freight demand or tight trucking capacity. Our inability to secure the services of these third parties could significantly limit our ability to serve our customers on competitive terms. Additionally, if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers or provide services on competitive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services is affected by many risks beyond our control, including equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers, interruptions in service due to labor disputes, changes in regulations impacting transportation, and changes in transportation rates.\nCertain provisions of our corporate documents and Delaware law could deter acquisition proposals and make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company. This could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving the Company that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Without stockholder approval, our Board of Directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company. Our certificate of incorporation also provides:\n\u2022\nfor a classified Board of Directors, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with approximately one-third of the directors coming up for re-election each year, making it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of the Board of Directors through a proxy contest;\n\u2022\nthat vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled only by the remaining directors in office, even if only one director remains in office;\n\u2022\nthat directors may only be removed for \u201ccause\u201d and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nthat the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock is required to approve any merger or consolidation with any other business entity that requires approval of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nthat stockholders can only act by written consent if such consent is signed by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u2022\nthat each of the provisions set forth above may only be amended by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock.\nOur bylaws also require advance notice of all stockholder proposals, including nominations for election as director. We have in the past adopted a shareholder rights plan, which was voluntarily terminated by the Board of Directors in April 2014. We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203.\nKnight Transportation, Inc.\u2019s unsolicited takeover proposal was, and any future unsolicited offers may be, disruptive to our business.\nIn September 2013, Knight Transportation, Inc. (\u201cKnight\u201d) announced its unsolicited takeover proposal for our outstanding common stock. Responding to Knight\u2019s unsolicited proposal, exploring the availability of alternative transactions that reflected our full intrinsic value and instituting legal action in connection with Knight\u2019s tender offer created a significant distraction for our management team and required us to expend significant time and resources, and any future unsolicited proposals may lead to similar disruptions. Moreover, the hostile and unsolicited nature of the proposal may have further disrupted our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees, suppliers and customers, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and strategic initiatives and cause volatility in our stock price. These consequences, alone or in combination, may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we have entered into a change in control/severance plan with certain of our officers, including our named executive officers, and members of our management team. The participants of the change in control arrangements may be entitled to severance payments and benefits upon a termination of their employment by us without cause or by them for good reason in connection with a change of control of the Company (each as defined in the applicable plan). The change in control arrangements may not be adequate to allow us to retain critical employees during a time when a change in control is being proposed or is imminent. The legal action we instituted in connection with Knight\u2019s unsolicited offer settled in February 2014, pursuant to which Knight entered into a voting agreement and a standstill agreement with us. While this resolved the uncertainty with respect to Knight\u2019s unsolicited offer, any future takeover attempt could have a disruptive impact on our business.\nWe face various risks associated with stockholder activists.\nActivist stockholders have advocated for certain changes at the Company. Such activist stockholders or potential stockholders may attempt to gain additional representation on or control of our Board of Directors, the possibility of which may create uncertainty regarding our future. These perceived uncertainties may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, raise customer concerns, or cause volatility in the price of our common stock. The presence of such activist stockholders also may create a significant distraction for our management team and require us to expend significant time and resources, depending on the nature of the activists\u2019 activities.\nA potential proxy contest would be disruptive to our operations and cause it to incur substantial costs. The SEC has proposed to give stockholders the ability to include their director nominees and their proposals relating to a stockholder nomination process in our proxy materials, which would make it easier for activists to nominate directors to our Board of Directors. The SEC\u2019s proposed rule was struck down by a federal court in 2011. However, if the SEC is successful in implementing a similar rule in the future, we may face an increase in the number of stockholder nominees for election to our Board of Directors. Future proxy contests and the presence of additional activist stockholder nominees on our Board of Directors could interfere with our ability to execute our long-term turnaround plan and other strategic initiatives, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of our management and employees.\nAdditionally, we could be subjected to activist stockholder lawsuits. Such lawsuits are time-consuming and could require us to incur substantial legal fees and proxy costs in defending our position. Among other things, such lawsuits divert management\u2019s time and attention from operations and can also cause distractions among our employees.", "PERMNO": 77425, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "USAK"}
