{"cik": "1610532", "company": "Hortonworks, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report and in our other public filings, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not become profitable in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $177.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, $46.2 million and $19.7 million in the eight months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, $36.6 million and $11.5 million in the years ended April 30, 2013 and 2012. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $271.7 million at December 31, 2014. These losses and our accumulated deficit includes the accounting for the Yahoo!, Inc., or Yahoo!, preferred stock warrant (the \u201c2011 Yahoo! Warrant\u201d) described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Because the market for our solution is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. We may not achieve sufficient revenue to attain and maintain profitability. We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, expand and improve the effectiveness of our distribution channels, and continue to invest in the development of the Hortonworks Data Platform. In addition, as we grow and as a result of being a newly public company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result of these increased expenses, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to be profitable in future periods. Any failure by us to sustain or increase profitability on a consistent basis could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations.\nWe were incorporated in 2011 and introduced our first solution in 2012. As a result of our limited operating history, our ability to forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our historical revenue growth has been inconsistent, has benefited from transactions with related parties and should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenues could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our support subscription offerings and our professional services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have also encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth (each of which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe do not have an adequate history with our support subscription offerings or pricing models to accurately predict the long-term rate of support subscription customer renewals or adoption, or the impact these renewals and adoption will have on our revenues or results of operations.\nWe have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our support subscription offerings. As the market for open source distributed data platforms matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new support subscription customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. Moreover, large support subscription customers, which are the focus of our sales efforts, may demand greater price concessions. As a result, in the\nIndex to Financial Statements\nfuture we may be required to reduce our prices, which could harm our revenues, gross margins, financial position and cash flows. Furthermore, while the terms of our support subscription agreements limit the number of supported nodes or the size of supported data sets, such limitations may be improperly circumvented or otherwise bypassed by certain users.\nWe expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewals of existing support subscription agreements. As a result, customers renewing and expanding their support subscription relationships with us will be critical to our business. Our support subscription customers have no obligation to renew their support subscriptions after the expiration of the initial support subscription period and may renew for fewer elements of our support subscription offerings or on different pricing terms. We have limited historical data with respect to support subscription customer renewals, and to date, the majority of our support subscription agreements have not reached the end of their original term, so we cannot accurately predict support subscription customer renewals. Our support subscription customers\u2019 renewals may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our pricing or the Hortonworks Data Platform and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. If our support subscription customers do not renew their support subscriptions on similar pricing terms, our revenues may decline and our business could suffer. In addition, over time the average term of our contracts could change based on renewals or for other reasons.\nBecause we derive substantially all of our revenues and cash flows from supporting the Hortonworks Data Platform and services and training related to it, failure of these offerings to satisfy customer requirements or to achieve increased market acceptance would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues and cash flows from customer fees for support subscription offerings and professional services in support of the Hortonworks Data Platform. As such, the market acceptance of the Hortonworks Data Platform is critical to our continued success. Demand for the Hortonworks Data Platform is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market acceptance of open source distributed data platforms by referenceable accounts for existing and new use cases, the continued enhancement of the Hortonworks Data Platform to incorporate features and functionality desired by our support subscription customers, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, technological change and growth or contraction in our market. We expect the proliferation of unstructured data to lead to an increase in the data storage and processing demands of our customers, and the Hortonworks Data Platform may not be able to perform to meet those demands. If we are unable to continue to meet support subscription customer requirements or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of the Hortonworks Data Platform, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects will be harmed.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to penetrate the existing market for open source distributed data platforms as well as the growth and expansion of the market for open source distributed data platforms.\nThe market for Hadoop and open source distributed data platforms is relatively new, rapidly evolving and unproven. Our future success will depend in large part on Hadoop\u2019s ability to penetrate the existing market for open source distributed data platforms, as well as the continued growth and expansion of the market for open source distributed data platforms. It is difficult to predict support subscription customer adoption and renewals, support subscription customer demand for our offerings, the size, growth rate and expansion of these markets, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate the existing market and any expansion of the market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our offerings, as well as support subscription customers\u2019 willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data storage and processing. Furthermore, many potential support subscription customers have made significant investments in legacy data storage and processing software and may be unwilling to invest in new solutions. If the market for open source distributed data platforms fails to grow or expand or decreases in size, our business would be harmed.\nIndex to Financial Statements If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition to our direct sales force and our website, we use strategic partners, such as distribution partners and resellers, to sell our support subscription offerings and our professional services. We expect that sales through partners will continue to grow as a proportion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.\nOur agreements with our partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our partners may offer customers the products and services of several different companies, including products and services that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our support subscription offerings and our professional services, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products and services or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our support subscription offerings and our professional services may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our support subscription offerings or professional services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our results of operations.\nOur ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our partners, and in helping our partners enhance their ability to independently sell our support subscription offerings and our professional services. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these partners, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe face substantial competition from Hadoop distribution vendors such as Cloudera and MapR Technologies, as well as enterprise software and infrastructure vendors that offer Hadoop distributions such as IBM Corporation and Oracle Corporation. Further, other established system providers not currently focused on Hadoop, including traditional data warehouse solution providers such as Teradata Corporation, SAP SE and EMC Corporation, or open source distributed data platform providers, including non-relational NoSQL database providers such as MongoDB Inc. and DataStax, Inc., may expand their products and services to compete with us. Additionally, some potential customers may elect to implement and support Hadoop deployments internally, thus not purchasing a support subscription from us. Some of the companies that compete with us, or that may compete with us in the future, have greater name recognition, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, the ability to devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and support of their solutions, more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships and longer operating histories than we have.\nWe expect competition to increase as other companies continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures on our support subscription offerings and our professional services, which could negatively impact our gross margins. If we are unable to effectively compete, our revenue could decline and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe competitive position of the Hortonworks Data Platform depends in part on its ability to operate with third-party products and services, including those of our partners, and, if we are not successful in maintaining and expanding the compatibility of the Hortonworks Data Platform with such products and services, our business will suffer.\nThe competitive position of the Hortonworks Data Platform depends in part on its ability to operate with products and services of third parties, including software companies that offer applications designed for various business intelligence applications, software services and infrastructure, and it must be continuously modified and enhanced to adapt to changes in hardware, software, networking, browser and database technologies. In the future, one or more technology companies, whether our partners or otherwise, may choose not to support the\nIndex to Financial Statements\noperation of their software, software services and infrastructure with the Hortonworks Data Platform, or the Hortonworks Data Platform may not support the capabilities needed to operate with such software, software services and infrastructure. In addition, to the extent that a third party were to develop software or services that compete with ours, that provider may choose not to support the Hortonworks Data Platform. We intend to facilitate the compatibility of the Hortonworks Data Platform with various third-party software, software services and infrastructure offerings by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships. If we are not successful in achieving this goal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIf open source software programmers, many of whom we do not employ, do not continue to develop and enhance open source technologies, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price.\nWe rely to a significant degree on a number of independent open source software programmers, or Hadoop committers and contributors, to develop and enhance Apache Hadoop and its related technologies. Additionally, members of the corresponding Apache Software Foundation Project Management Committees, many of whom are not employed by us, are primarily responsible for the oversight and evolution of the codebases of Hadoop and its related technologies. If the Hadoop committers and contributors fail to adequately further develop and enhance open source technologies, or if the Project Management Committees fail to oversee and guide the evolution of Hadoop-related technologies in the manner that we believe is appropriate to maximize the market potential of our offerings, then we would have to rely on other parties, or we would need to expend additional resources, to develop and enhance our offerings. We cannot predict whether further developments and enhancements to these technologies would be available from reliable alternative sources. In either event, our development expenses could be increased and our technology release and upgrade schedules could be delayed. Delays in developing, completing or delivering new or enhanced offerings could cause our offerings to be less competitive, impair customer acceptance of our offerings and result in delayed or reduced revenue for our offerings.\nOur subscription-based business model may encounter customer resistance or we may experience a decline in the demand for our offerings.\nWe provide our support subscription offerings under annual or multi-year subscriptions. A support subscription generally entitles a support subscription customer to a specified scope of support, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology and new versions of the software, if and when available, and compatibility with an ecosystem of certified hardware and software applications. We may encounter support subscription customer resistance to this distribution model or support subscription customers may fail to honor the terms of our support subscription agreements. To the extent we are unsuccessful in promoting or defending this distribution model, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nDemand for our offerings may fluctuate based on numerous factors, including the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective support subscription customers, and general economic conditions. In addition, our support subscription customers generally undertake a significant evaluation process that may result in a prolonged sales cycle. We spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales efforts, including developing and implementing appropriate go-to-market strategies and training our sales force and ecosystem partners in order to effectively market new solutions, without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. The purchase of our offerings may be discretionary and can involve significant expenditures. If our current and prospective support subscription customers cut costs, then they may significantly reduce their enterprise software expenditures.\nAs technologies and the markets for our offerings change, our subscription-based business model may no longer meet the needs of our support subscription customers. Consequently, we may need to develop new and\nIndex to Financial Statements\nappropriate marketing and pricing strategies for our solutions. If we are unable to adapt our business model to changes in the marketplace or if demand for our solutions declines, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to expand sales to existing customers, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur future growth depends in part upon expanding sales of our support subscription offerings and our professional services to our existing customers. If our existing customers do not purchase additional support subscription offerings and professional services, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all or may decline. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to our current customer base requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in increased sales to existing customers and additional revenues. If our efforts to expand sales to our existing customers are not successful, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nRevenue from our largest customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues, and the loss of one or more of our significant customers would harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue has been concentrated among a relatively small number of large customers. For example, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 21.7% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, 37.8% of our total revenue for the eight months ended December 31, 2013 and 55.3% of our total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2013. The revenue from our three largest customers as a group accounted for 42.8% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, 50.5% of our total revenue for the eight months ended December 31, 2013 and 71.0% of our total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2013. While we expect that the revenue from our largest customers will continue to decrease over time as a percentage of our total revenue as we generate more revenue from other customers, we expect that revenue from a relatively small group of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue, at least in the near term. Our customer agreements generally do not contain long-term commitments from our customers, and our customers may be able to terminate their agreements with us prior to expiration of the term. For example, the current term of our agreement with Microsoft expires in July 2015, and automatically renews thereafter for two successive twelve-month periods unless terminated earlier. The agreement may be terminated by Microsoft prior to the end of its term. Accordingly, the agreement with Microsoft may not continue for any specific period of time.\nWe may not be able to continue our relationships with any of our largest customers on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or our relationships may not continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our revenue and operating results would suffer if, among other things, any of our largest customers were to renegotiate, terminate, renew on less favorable terms or fail to renew their agreements with us.\nOur future results of operations may fluctuate significantly, and our recent results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nOur revenue and results of operations could vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, many of which are outside of our control. At the beginning of each quarter, we do not know the number of support subscriptions that we will enter into during the quarter. In addition, the contract value of our support subscriptions varies substantially among customers, and a single, large support subscription in a given period could distort our results of operations. Comparing our revenue and results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict our future revenue or results of operations on a quarterly or longer-term basis. We base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are expected to be relatively fixed in the short-term. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs\nIndex to Financial Statements\nsufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue, and even a small shortfall in revenue in a quarter could harm our financial results for that quarter and cause our financial results to fall short of analyst expectations, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nIn addition to other risk factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022\nthe timing of new customer contracts for support subscription offerings and professional services, and the extent to which we earn additional revenue from existing customers as they expand their deployment of the Hortonworks Data Platform;\n\u2022\nthe renewals of our support subscription arrangements with our customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our market;\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new software or software enhancements;\n\u2022\nthe timing of satisfying revenue recognition criteria and our ability to obtain vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, for our support subscription offerings;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe proportion of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions and the impact that a change in such proportion may have on the overall average selling price of our support subscription offerings;\n\u2022\nthe proportion of revenue attributable to support subscription offerings and professional services, which may impact our gross margins and operating income;\n\u2022\nthe reduction or elimination of support of the Apache Hadoop Project by the Apache Software Foundation, migration of Hadoop technology to an organization other than the Apache Software Foundation, or any other actions taken by the Apache Software Foundation or the Apache Hadoop Project that may impact our business model;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe collectability of receivables from customers and resellers, which may be hindered or delayed if these customers or resellers experience financial distress; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control, and the variability and unpredictability of such factors could result in our failing to meet or exceed our financial expectations for a given period. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, results of operations and cash flows may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large support subscription customers, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts, the length and variability of the sales cycle of our support subscription offerings and the difficulty in making short-term adjustments to our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to large support subscription customers and increasing sales to existing customers. The length of our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to payment for our support subscription offerings is generally six to nine months, but can vary substantially from customer to customer. Our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large\nIndex to Financial Statements\ntransactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed. As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast our revenues accurately in any quarter. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan or maintain high levels of service and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe have increased our number of full-time employees to 601 at December 31, 2014 from 171 at December 31, 2012 and have increased our revenue to $46.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $4.8 million in the eight months ended December 31, 2012. Our recent growth and expansion has placed, and our anticipated growth may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to continue to expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations. Continued growth increases the challenges involved in:\n\u2022\nrecruiting, training and retaining sufficient skilled technical, marketing, sales and management personnel;\n\u2022\npreserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and improving our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, compliance, recordkeeping, communications and other internal systems;\n\u2022\nmanaging our international operations and the risks associated therewith;\n\u2022\nmaintaining high levels of satisfaction with our solutions among our customers; and\n\u2022\neffectively managing expenses related to any future growth.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nOur future success depends in large part on the growth of the market for big data applications, and an increase in the desire to store and process big data, and we cannot be sure that the market for big data applications will grow as expected or, even if such growth occurs, that our business will grow at similar rates, or at all.\nOur ability to increase the adoption of the Hortonworks Data Platform, increase sales of support subscription offerings and professional services, and grow our business depends on the increased adoption of big data applications by enterprises. While we believe that big data applications can offer a compelling value proposition to many enterprises, the broad adoption of big data applications also presents challenges to enterprises, including developing the internal expertise and infrastructure to manage big data applications effectively, coordinating multiple data sources, defining a big data strategy that delivers an appropriate return on investment and implementing an information technology infrastructure and architecture that enables the efficient deployment of big data solutions. Accordingly, our expectations regarding the potential for future growth in the market for big data applications, and the third-party growth estimates for this market in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are subject to significant uncertainty. If the market for big data applications does not grow as expected, our business prospects may be adversely affected. Even if the market for big data applications increases, we cannot be sure that our business will grow at a similar rate, or at all.\nIndex to Financial Statements Because of the characteristics of open source software, there are few technological barriers to entry into the open source market by new competitors and it may be relatively easy for competitors, some of which may have greater resources than we have, to enter our markets and compete with us.\nOne of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone may modify and redistribute the existing open source software and use it to compete in the marketplace. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. It is possible for competitors with greater resources than ours to develop their own open source software, including software based on one or more components of Hadoop or the Hortonworks Data Platform, potentially reducing the demand for our solutions and putting price pressure on our support subscription offerings and our professional services. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software will not result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur software development and licensing model could be negatively impacted if the Apache License, Version 2.0 is not enforceable or is modified so as to become incompatible with other open source licenses.\nThe Hortonworks Data Platform has been provided under the Apache License 2.0. This license states that any work of authorship licensed under it, and any derivative work thereof, may be reproduced and distributed provided that certain conditions are met. It is possible that a court would hold this license to be unenforceable or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under it. Any ruling by a court that this license is not enforceable, or that open source components of the Hortonworks Data Platform may not be reproduced or distributed, may negatively impact our distribution or development of all or a portion of the Hortonworks Data Platform. In addition, at some time in the future it is possible that Apache Hadoop may be distributed under a different license or the Apache License 2.0 may be modified, which could, among other consequences, negatively impact our continuing development or distribution of the software code subject to the new or modified license. Further, full utilization of the Hortonworks Data Platform may depend on applications and services from various third parties, and in the future these applications or services may not be available to our customers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could harm our business.\nWe do not currently have vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for support subscription offerings, and we may offer certain contractual provisions to our customers that result in delayed recognition of revenue under GAAP, which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from period-to-period in ways that do not correlate with our underlying business performance.\nIn the course of our selling efforts, we typically enter into sales arrangements pursuant to which we provide support subscription offerings and professional services. We refer to each individual product or service as an \u201celement\u201d of the overall sales arrangement. These arrangements typically require us to deliver particular elements in a future period. We apply software revenue recognition rules under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In certain cases, when we enter into more than one contract with a single customer, the group of contracts may be so closely related that they are viewed under GAAP as one multiple-element arrangement for purposes of determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue recognition. As we discuss further in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition,\u201d because we do not have VSOE for our support subscription offerings, and because we may offer certain contractual provisions to our customers, such as delivery of support subscription offerings and professional services, or specified functionality, or because multiple contracts signed in different periods may be viewed as giving rise to multiple elements of a single arrangement, we may be required under GAAP to defer revenue to future periods. Typically, for arrangements providing for support subscription offerings and professional services, we have recognized as revenue the entire arrangement fee ratably over the support subscription period, although the appropriate timing of revenue recognition must be evaluated on an arrangement-by-arrangement basis and may differ from arrangement to\nIndex to Financial Statements\narrangement. If we are unexpectedly required to defer revenue to future periods for a significant portion of our sales, our revenue for a particular period could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from support subscription customers ratably over the term of their subscription agreements, which are generally 12 months, with some support subscription customers having subscription agreements with longer terms. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in the value of new support subscription agreements entered in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue we record in that quarter and will harm our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect this reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new support subscription customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support subscription offerings may harm our relationships with our support subscription customers and results of operations.\nOnce the Hortonworks Data Platform is deployed, our support subscription customers depend on our software support organization to resolve technical issues relating to the deployment. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in support subscription customer demand for support subscription offerings. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support subscription offerings to compete with changes in offerings provided by our competitors. Increased support subscription customer demand for our support subscription offerings, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and harm our results of operations. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing support subscription customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality support subscription offerings, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support subscription offerings, could harm our reputation, our ability to sell our support subscription offerings to existing and prospective support subscription customers and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our customer contracts, our business could be harmed.\nAny failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts could result in the imposition of various penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nThe Hortonworks Data Platform may contain defects that may be costly to correct, delay market acceptance of our solutions and expose us to claims and litigation.\nDespite our testing procedures, errors, including security vulnerabilities or incompatibilities with third-party software and hardware, have been and may continue to be found in the Hortonworks Data Platform after deployment. This risk is increased by the fact that much of the code in the Hortonworks Data Platform is developed by independent parties over whom we may not exercise supervision or control. If errors are discovered, we may have to make significant expenditures of capital and devote significant technical resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or manage them, and we may not be able to successfully do so in a timely manner, or at all. Errors and failures in the Hortonworks Data Platform could result in a loss of, or delay in, market\nIndex to Financial Statements\nacceptance of our enterprise technologies, loss of existing or potential customers and delayed or lost revenue and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince enterprise users of the benefits of the Hortonworks Data Platform.\nIn addition, errors in the Hortonworks Data Platform could cause system failures, loss of data or other adverse effects for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us. Although our agreements with our customers often contain provisions that seek to limit our exposure to such claims, it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. While we seek to insure against these types of claims, our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to such claims. These claims, even if unsuccessful, could be costly and time consuming to defend and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncorrect or improper implementation or use of the Hortonworks Data Platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nThe Hortonworks Data Platform is deployed in a wide variety of technology environments, including in large-scale, complex technology environments, and we believe our future success will depend at least in part on our ability to support such deployments. Hadoop itself is technically very complicated, and it is not easy to maximize the value of the Hortonworks Data Platform without proper implementation and training. We often must assist our customers in achieving successful implementations for large, complex deployments. If our customers are unable to implement the Hortonworks Data Platform successfully, or in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our company and the Hortonworks Data Platform may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or increase their purchases of our support subscription offerings or professional services.\nOur customers and partners may need training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from the Hortonworks Data Platform to maximize its potential. The Hortonworks Data Platform may perform inadequately if it is not implemented or used correctly or as intended. The incorrect or improper implementation or use of the Hortonworks Data Platform, our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use the Hortonworks Data Platform, or our failure to provide effective support subscription offerings or professional services to our customers, may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales of our support subscription offerings and professional services.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur website and internal technology infrastructure may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website or third-party hosting disruptions or capacity constraints due to a number of potential causes, including technical failures, natural disasters or fraud or security attacks. If our security is compromised, our website is unavailable or our users are unable to download the Hortonworks Data Platform or order support subscription offerings or professional services within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and applications for the Hortonworks Data Platform. To the extent that we do not effectively upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, we rely on SaaS technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services from NetSuite Inc., customer relationship management services from salesforce.com, Inc. and lead generation management services from Marketo, Inc. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nour processes for managing sales of our support subscription offerings and professional services and supporting our customers could be impaired, and our ability to generate and manage sales leads could be weakened until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees, including many Hadoop committers. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, operations, security, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors in our research and development. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or executive officers could harm our business.\nIn addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software and Apache Hadoop applications and experienced sales professionals. The Apache Hadoop Project relies on Hadoop committers for the project\u2019s technical management. While we currently employ a large number of Hadoop core committers and innovators, one becomes a committer by invitation only. As a result, the market to hire such individuals is very competitive. If our employees who are Hadoop core committers terminate their employment with us, we could lose our ability to innovate the core open source technology, define the roadmap for the future of Hadoop, distribute predictable and reliable enterprise quality releases, and provide comprehensive support to our customers. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nIf we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be harmed.\nWe continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional use cases among our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel, including enterprise sales representatives and sales engineers, with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. In particular, there is significant demand for sales engineers with Hadoop expertise. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, as we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force will have relatively little experience working with us, our support subscription offerings and our business model. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or our sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be harmed.\nIndex to Financial Statements If we are not successful in expanding our international business, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.\nOur future results depend, in part, on our ability to expand into international markets. We also have a number of distributor and reseller relationships for our support subscription offerings and professional services in international markets. Our ability to expand internationally will depend upon our ability to deliver functionality and foreign language translations that reflect the needs of the international clients that we target. Our ability to expand internationally involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in such expansion, and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future or at all in these less familiar competitive environments. We may also choose to conduct our international business through strategic alliances. If we are unable to identify strategic alliance partners or negotiate favorable alliance terms, our international growth may be harmed. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in advance of generating material revenues as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets.\nExpanding our business internationally will also require significant attention from our management and will require us to add additional management and other resources in these markets. Our ability to expand our business, attract talented employees and enter into strategic alliances in an increasing number of international markets requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, commercial infrastructures and technology infrastructure. If we are unable to grow our international operations in a timely manner, we may incur additional losses and our revenue growth could be harmed.\nAs we expand internationally, our business will become more susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe principally sell our offerings through sales personnel in the United States, Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom and currently have operations in the United States and in London, United Kingdom. We also have development teams in India and Kiev, Ukraine and a number of distributor and reseller relationships for our support subscription offerings and our professional services in other international markets. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npotentially different pricing environments and longer sales cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the staffing of international operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates;\n\u2022\ndependence on strategic alliance partners to increase client acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, particularly with our development team in Ukraine;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nIndex to Financial Statements The occurrence of any one of these risks could harm our international business and, consequently, our results of operations. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions in the past and intend to do so in the future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or partners, or to achieve expected benefits from such acquisitions or partnerships, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.\nAs part of our ongoing business strategy to expand our suite of solutions and acquire new technology, from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures. In May 2014, we acquired new technology, know-how and solutions through our acquisition of XA Secure, a data security company. There may be significant competition for acquisition targets in our industry, or we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate attractive terms for acquisitions or complete acquisitions on expected timelines, or at all. If we are unable to complete strategic acquisitions or do not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions we do complete, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.\nEven if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will be successful, such transactions are inherently risky. Significant risks associated with these transactions, include:\n\u2022\nfailing to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary software or services;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nintegration and restructuring costs, both one-time and ongoing;\n\u2022\nmaintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u2022\nestablishing new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nour dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenue to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotentially incurring accounting charges as we transition an acquired company to our open-source business model;\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated and unknown liabilities.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future or do not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions we do complete, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions, some of which may ultimately not be consummated or not result in expected benefits. The occurrence of any of these acquisition-related risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance strong brands.\nWe believe that the brand identities that we have developed have contributed significantly to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our customer\nIndex to Financial Statements\nbase and attracting talented employees. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make further investments that may not be successful. Maintaining our brands will depend in part on our ability to remain a leader in open source technology and our ability to continue to provide high-quality offerings. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur excessive costs in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed.\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights in our know-how, software and trademarks.\nWe have developed proprietary methodologies, know-how and software related to software development, testing and quality assurance. Failure to adequately protect and defend our intellectual property rights in these areas may diminish the value of the Hortonworks Data Platform, impair our ability to compete effectively and harm our business.\nIn addition, the protective steps we have taken in the past may be inadequate to protect and deter misappropriation of our trademark rights. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our trademark rights in a timely manner. We have registered trademarks in the United States, Canada and the European Community and have trademark applications pending in various other international jurisdictions. Effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to distribute our solutions. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy one or more of our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively. Furthermore, defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies can dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights, and to defend claims that may be brought against them, than we can. We have received, and we and the Apache Hadoop Project may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and, to the extent Hadoop gains greater market visibility, we and the Apache Hadoop Project face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.\nAny intellectual property infringement claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. Any of these results would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFederal, state, foreign government and industry regulations, as well as self-regulation related to privacy and data security concerns pose the threat of lawsuits and other liability.\nWe do not generally collect and utilize demographic and other information, including personally identifiable information, from and about users (such as customers, potential customers, and others). Users may, however,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nprovide personal information to us in many contexts such as when signing up for certain services, registering for seminars, participating in a survey, connecting with other users and Hadoop experts in our forums, participating in Hortonworks University classes, participating in polls or signing up to receive e-mail newsletters.\nWithin the United States, various federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of the data we receive from and about users. Outside of the United States, various jurisdictions actively regulate and enforce laws regarding the collection, retention, transfer and use (including loss and unauthorized access) of personal information. Privacy advocates and government bodies have increasingly scrutinized the ways in which companies link personal identities and data associated with particular users or devices with data collected through the internet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. Loss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may hurt our business.\nAny security breach, unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus or similar breach or disruption could result in the loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, early termination of our contracts, litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. If our, our customers\u2019 or our partners\u2019 security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if a high-profile security breach occurs with respect to another Hadoop provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of Hadoop-based solutions generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones.\nProlonged economic uncertainties or downturns could harm our business.\nCurrent or future economic downturns could harm our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations and terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in corporate spending on enterprise software in general and slow down the rate of growth of our business.\nGeneral worldwide economic conditions have experienced, and in the future may experience, a significant downturn. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our offerings, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe have a significant number of customers in the business services, advertising, financial services, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, high technology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, oil and gas, online services, retail and telecommunications industries. A substantial downturn in any of these industries may cause firms to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology. Customers in these industries may delay or cancel information technology\nIndex to Financial Statements\nprojects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. To the extent purchases of our offerings are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenues may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, support subscription customers may choose to develop or utilize in-house support capabilities as an alternative to purchasing our support subscription offerings or professional services. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices of support subscription offerings. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our support subscription offerings or professional services.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or industries in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or otherwise enhance the Hortonworks Data Platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms that are satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $124.0 million and $142.5 million, respectively, due to prior period losses. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, including in connection with our initial public offering, and if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that, due to\nIndex to Financial Statements\nregulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability.\nWe have business and customer relationships with certain entities who are stockholders or affiliated with our directors, or both, and conflicts of interest may arise because of such relationships.\nSome of our customers and other business partners are affiliated with certain of our directors or hold shares of our capital stock, or both. For example, we have entered into strategic partnerships and/or customer relationships with Yahoo! Inc., Red Hat, Inc., Teradata Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company. Our directors Jay Rossiter, Paul Cormier and Martin Fink are employees of Yahoo! Inc., Red Hat, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company, respectively, and each of Yahoo! Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company and Teradata Corporation are stockholders. We believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with related parties are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and these other parties or their affiliates. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise between us and these other parties and their affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, including with competitors of such related parties, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California and we utilize data centers that are located in North America. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services and sales activities. The west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, extended interruptions in the Hortonworks Data Platform, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our future results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance resulting in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely regardless of our operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates and publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our offerings, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from operating our business, and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chair of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the federal securities laws, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain of these exemptions. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the five-year anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue; (iii) the end of the fiscal year in which we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates as of the end of the second quarter of such fiscal year; and (iv) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the exchanges and other markets upon which our common stock is listed, and other applicable securities rules and regulations.\nIndex to Financial Statements Compliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis and we are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date of our initial public offering. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally audit and attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nBeing a public company and these new rules and regulations will continue to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in our filings with the SEC, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to changes in the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business, and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our stock price, which may never occur.\nIndex to Financial Statements If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2014, we had 42,724,814 shares of common stock outstanding. As a result of market stand-off agreements, 35,041,245 shares of our common stock are subject to restrictions on their sale for 180 days after December 12, 2014 (subject in some cases to volume limitations). In addition, certain of these shares are also subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters. Further, as of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding options and warrants to purchase 17,736,512 shares of our common stock that, if exercised, will result in these additional shares becoming available for sale upon expiration of the lock-up agreements and market stand-off agreements. Goldman, Sachs & Co. may, in its sole discretion, permit our officers, director, employees and current stockholders who are subject to lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements.\nThe holders of an aggregate of 26,552,648 shares of our common stock, including the holder of warrants to purchase 3,250,000 shares of our common stock and 476,368 shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2014, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. We have also registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. These shares may be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to certain market stand-off or lock-up agreements.\nOur charter documents designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIndex to Financial Statements", "PERMNO": 15128, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "HDP"}
