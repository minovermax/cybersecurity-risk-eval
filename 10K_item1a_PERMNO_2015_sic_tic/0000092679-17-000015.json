{"cik": "92679", "company": "SPARTON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing economic, political and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7, highlight some of these risks. The terms \u201cSparton,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Sparton Corporation and subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is exploring a potential sale of the Company, but there can be no assurances that any transaction will occur, or if such a transaction does occur, the value of that transaction to the Company or its shareholders.\nThe pending merger transaction with Ultra may not be completed on the terms or anticipated timeline or at all. The completion of the pending merger transaction with Ultra is subject to certain conditions, including (i) approval by our shareholders, (ii) approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement for the purposes of Chapter 10 of the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority; (iii) the periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under the Investment Canada Act shall have expired, lapsed or been terminated and any applicable regulatory clearance shall have been obtained, (iv) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (v) all periods applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the antitrust or competition Laws of each applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction shall have expired, lapsed or been terminated and all antitrust or competition regulatory clearances applicable to the consummation of the merger in each such jurisdiction shall have been obtained or waived, (vi) approval from The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, (vii) approval from the Defense Security Service of the United States Department of Defense, (viii) expiration or waiver under ITAR; and (ix) other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not occur that could delay or prevent the closing conditions from being satisfied.\nThe pending merger transaction may not be completed, which may adversely affect our business.\nIf the merger with Ultra is not completed, the trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of the common stock reflects positive market assumptions that the merger will be completed and the related benefits will be realized. We could also be subject to other risks if the merger is not completed, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement in the Merger Agreement that, under certain circumstances, we pay Ultra a termination fee of $7.5 million;\n\u2022\nincurring costs related to the merger transaction, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs that have already been incurred or will continue to be incurred until closing of the transaction;\n\u2022\npotential reputational harm due to any failure to successfully complete the merger transaction;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business, such as distraction of our employees to pursue other opportunities that could be beneficial to the Company, without the merger transaction actually being completed; and\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our ERAPSCO joint venture and/or potential difficulties negotiating a new merger transaction given a failed transaction with Ultra;\n\u2022\nUncertainties and disruption caused by potential plant closures and possible restructuring;\n\u2022\nNeed to renegotiate credit facility to provide for additional liquidity to meet working capital needs;\n\u2022\nPotential disruption to our business to possible loss of customers and possible changes in vendor terms as a result of uncertainties.\nIf the pending merger transaction with Ultra is completed, our shareholders would not benefit from potential future appreciation in the value of the Company.\nIf the pending merger transaction with Ultra is consummated, shareholders will no longer hold shares in the Company and, therefore, will not be entitled to benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of the Company. In addition, in the absence of the merger transaction, the Company could have various opportunities to enhance its value. Therefore, if the merger transaction is consummated, our shareholders will forgo any future appreciation in the value of the Company.\nIf the pending merger transaction with Ultra is not consummated by January 31, 2018 (unless extended under the Merger Agreement), either of the Company or Ultra may terminate the Merger Agreement.\nThe Company or Ultra may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger transaction has not closed by January 31, 2018 (subject to a two-month extension at the election of either Ultra or the Company, and a second extension for an additional four months in the sole discretion of Ultra, if certain conditions have not been satisfied). The Merger Agreement provides for certain other termination rights for both the Company and Ultra, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger\nAgreement under certain specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Ultra a termination fee of $7.5 million or Ultra will be required to pay Company a termination fee of $7.5 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of the Company.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate any merger transaction or acquisition proposals.\nThose provisions could discourage a potential competing buyer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a part of the Company\u2019s business from considering or making a competing acquisition proposal, even if the potential competing acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash value than that market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger transaction. The provisions could also cause a potential competing buyer to propose to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the expense of a termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the Merger Agreement.\nOur Board and executives have different interests in the Ultra merger than those of our shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of other Company shareholders. These interests include restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options held by Company\u2019s executive officers and by directors of the Company immediately prior to the closing that may be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment. Further, our officers are party to employment agreements with the Company and may receive payments upon termination or change of control and could receive other additional payments, all as disclosed in the proxy statement.\nAn adverse judgment in a lawsuit challenging the pending Ultra transaction may prevent the transaction from becoming effective.\nThe Company and the members of our board of directors were named as defendants in four federal securities class actions purportedly brought on behalf of all holders of the Company\u2019s common stock challenging the pending merger transaction with Ultra. The lawsuits generally sought, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with the shareholder vote on the merger at the special meeting or consummating the merger transaction unless and until the Company disclosed the allegedly omitted information. The complaints also sought damages allegedly suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the asserted omissions, as well as related attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\nAfter discussions with counsel for the plaintiffs, the Company included certain additional disclosures in the proxy statement soliciting shareholder approval of the Merger. The Company believes the demands and complaints are without merit, there were substantial legal and factual defenses to the claims asserted, and the proxy statement disclosed all material information prior to the inclusion of the additional disclosures. The Company made the additional disclosures to avoid the expense and burden of litigation. On September 1, 2017, the court dismissed the lawsuits with prejudice with respect to lead plaintiffs in the lawsuits and without prejudice as to all other shareholders. The Company and plaintiffs must still attempt to resolve the appropriate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, if any, to be awarded to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\nShareholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the Ultra merger transaction, which may name the Company, members of the board of directors or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits, including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims. If plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the pending merger transaction on the agreed-upon terms, such an injunction may delay the completion of the transaction in the expected timeframe, or may prevent the transaction from being completed altogether. Whether or not any plaintiff\u2019s claim is successful, this type of litigation may result in significant costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of business.\nThe industry is extremely competitive and we depend on continued outsourcing by OEMs.\nThe Military and Aerospace and Medical and Biotechnology industries are highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Our contract manufacturing services are available from many sources and we compete with numerous domestic and foreign firms. Within the Company\u2019s target market, the high-mix, low to medium volume sector of the MDS segment, there are substantially fewer competitors, but competition remains strong. Some competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, R&D, marketing or financial resources and, in some cases, have more geographically diversified international operations. The Company expects competition to intensify further as more companies enter our target markets and our customers consolidate. In the future, increased competition from large electronic component manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronics manufacturing services may occur. Future growth will depend on our ability to win business from competitors, new\noutsourcing opportunities and could be limited by OEMs performing such functions internally or delaying their decision to outsource.\nIn some cases, the Company may not be able to offer prices as low as some competitors for a host of reasons. For example, those competitors may have lower cost structures for their services, they may be willing to accept business at lower margins in order to utilize more of their excess capacity, or they may be willing to take on business at low or even zero gross margins to gain entry into the Company\u2019s markets. Upon the occurrence of any of these events, our net sales would likely decline. Periodically, we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to some competitors with greater direct buying power. As a result, competitors may have a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be quality, reliability, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, technological sophistication, geographic location and price. During periods of recession in the Military and Aerospace and Medical and Biotechnology industries, our competitive advantages in the areas of adaptive manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance due to increased price sensitivity. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, profit margin compression or loss of market share.\nOur operating results are subject to general economic conditions and may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors.\nWe are subject to inflation, interest rate changes, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, the effects of governmental plans to manage economic conditions and other national and global economic occurrences beyond our control. Such factors, economic weakness and constrained customer spending have resulted in the past and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates.\nWe can experience significant fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations. In addition to general economic conditions, other factors that contribute to these fluctuations are our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes and costs, as well as the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs, in order to maintain or increase profitability. We rely on our customers\u2019 demands, which can change dramatically, sometimes with little notice. Such factors also could affect our results of operations in the future.\nCustomer cancellations, reductions or delays could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe generally do not obtain long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers may cancel orders, delay the delivery of orders or release orders for fewer products than we previously anticipated for a variety of reasons, including decreases in demand for their products and services. Such changes by a significant customer, by a group of customers, or by a single customer whose production is material to an individual facility could seriously harm results of operations in that period. In addition, since much of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand would adversely affect our margins and operating income. Although we are always seeking new opportunities, we cannot be assured that we will be able to replace deferred, reduced or canceled orders.\nOur inability to forecast the level of customer orders with much certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. Additionally, we are often required to place materials orders from vendors, some of which are non-cancelable, based on an expected level of customer volume. If actual demand is higher than anticipated, we may be required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet such demand of our customers. Alternatively, anticipated orders from our customers may be delayed or fail to materialize, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. Such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past and we may experience similar effects in the future.\nSuch order changes could cause a delay in the repayment to us for inventory expenditures we incurred in preparation for the customer\u2019s orders or, in certain circumstances, require us to return the inventory to our suppliers, resell the inventory to another customer or continue to hold the inventory. In some cases, excess material resulting from longer order lead time is a risk due to the potential of order cancellation or design changes by customers. Additionally, dramatic changes in circumstances for a customer could also negatively impact the carrying value of our inventory for that customer.\nWe are dependent on a few large customers; the loss of such customers or reduction in their demand could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nFor fiscal year 2017, our ten largest customers, including the U.S. Navy, accounted for 50% of total net sales. The U.S. Navy, an ECP customer through the Company\u2019s ERAPSCO agreement, represented 23% of our total net sales. We expect to\ncontinue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers, but we cannot ensure that present or future large customers will not terminate, significantly change, reduce or delay their manufacturing arrangements with us. Because our major customers represent such a large part of our business, the loss of any of our major customers or reduced sales to these customers could negatively impact our business.\nThe U.S. Navy generally has the ability to terminate its contracts within the ECP segment, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. If any of these U.S. Navy contracts were to be terminated, the Company would generally be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed.\nWe are partner to a 50/50 joint venture agreement with USSI, the only other major producer of U.S. derivative sonobuoys. If USSI were to terminate this joint venture, the Company would be required to return to independent bidding and production for the U.S. Navy and other foreign governments that meet Department of State licensing requirements for sonobuoy business. If this were to happen, it is possible that the Company\u2019s future results could be negatively impacted. Starting with the 2014 U.S. government fiscal year, the U.S. Navy competitively bid sonobuoy contracts, potentially allowing additional competitors to vie for this business. The Company is aware that the U.S. Navy has funded a competitor for the qualification of one future sonobuoy variant that is currently not in production. While the Company believes that there are significant barriers to entry into the sonobuoy market, if a new competitor was able to successfully develop the necessary technical capabilities and gain entry into the market space, the Company\u2019s future results could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on the continued growth and financial stability of our customers. Adverse changes in the end markets they serve can reduce demand from our customers in those markets and/or make customers in these end markets more price sensitive. Furthermore, mergers or restructurings among our customers or our customers\u2019 customers could increase concentration or reduce total demand as the combined entities rationalize their business and consolidate their suppliers. Future developments, particularly in those end markets which account for more significant portions of our revenues, could harm our business and our results of operations. If one or more of our customers experiences financial difficulty and is unable to pay for the services provided, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. If our customers seek bankruptcy protection, they could act to terminate all or a portion of their business with us, originate new business with our competitors and terminate or assign our long-term supply agreements. Any loss of revenue from our major customers, including the non-payment or late payment of our invoices, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCongressional budgetary constraints or reallocations can reduce our government sales.\nOur U.S. government contracts have many inherent risks that could adversely impact our financial results. Future governmental sales could be affected by a change in defense spending by the U.S. government, or by changes in spending allocation that could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could adversely affect our financial results. The Company\u2019s U.S. governmental sales are funded by the federal budget. Changes in negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract.\nU.S. government audits and investigations could adversely affect our business.\nFederal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit and evaluate government contracts and government contractors\u2019 administrative processes and systems. These agencies review the Company\u2019s performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, financial capability and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the Company\u2019s internal control systems and policies, including the Company\u2019s purchasing, accounting, estimating, compensation and management information processes and systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If an audit or investigation of our business were to uncover improper or illegal activities, then we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, responding to governmental audits or investigations may involve significant expenses and divert management attention. If any of the forgoing were to occur, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current use of performance based billings within U.S. government contracts may not continue.\nOur current contracts with the U.S. Navy include provisions for certain billing and collection of funds from the U.S. Government in advance of related inventory purchases and incurrence of manufacturing expenses. These contractual provisions are an integral part of our capital and liquidity profile. While we have other sources of liquidity including, but not limited to, our operations, existing cash balances and our revolving line-of-credit and we believe we have sufficient liquidity for our\nanticipated needs over the next 12 months, no assurances regarding liquidity can be made. The discontinuance of performance based billing provisions from future U.S. Navy contracts would require us to fund the working capital requirements related to these contracts from other sources and otherwise could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company and its customers may be unable to keep current with technological changes.\nOur customers participate in markets that have rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life cycles. The introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable. Our success depends upon our customers\u2019 ability to enhance existing products and to develop and introduce new products, on a timely and cost-effective basis, that keep pace with technological developments and emerging standards and to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. There is no assurance that our customers will do so and any failure to do so could substantially harm our customers and us.\nAdditionally, our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our own technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services and products which meet changing customer needs and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis. If we are unable to do so, business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nStart-up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results and may not be recoverable.\nStart-up costs, the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with new programs and new customer relationships, and the need to estimate the extent and timing of required resources can adversely affect our profit margins and operating results. These factors are particularly evident with the introduction of new products and programs. The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when new facilities are opened or programs are transferred from one facility to another.\nIf new programs or customer relationships are terminated or delayed, our operating results may be harmed, particularly in the near term. We may not be able to recoup our start-up costs or quickly replace these anticipated new program revenues.\nWe depend on limited or single source suppliers for some critical components; the inability to obtain components as required, with favorable purchase terms, could harm our business.\nA significant portion of our costs are related to electronic components purchased to produce our products. In some cases our customers dictate that we purchase particular components from a single or limited number of suppliers. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production and thus delay shipments to customers and the associated revenue of all products using that component. This could cause the Company to experience a reduction in sales, increased inventory levels and costs and could adversely affect relationships with existing and prospective customers. In the past, we have secured sufficient allocations of constrained components so that revenue was not materially impacted. The Company believes that alternative suppliers are available to provide the components, including unique components, necessary to manufacture our customers\u2019 products. If, however, we are unable to procure necessary components under favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices and with the order lead times needed for the efficient and profitable operation of our factories, our results of operations could suffer.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC established new annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacturing of our electrical components. As a result, we may not be able to obtain products at competitive prices. We have had additional costs associated with complying with the new due diligence procedures as required by the SEC. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures as we implement them. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.\nA tightened credit market, either nationally or globally, may adversely affect the availability of funds to us for working capital, liquidity requirements and other purposes, which may adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have a revolving line-of-credit facility with a group of banks which is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. We anticipate that our credit facility will be a component of our available working capital during fiscal year 2018. However, there are no assurances that the line-of-credit will be sufficient for all purposes. Additionally, if vendors of electronic components restrict or reduce credit to us for the purchase of raw materials as a result of general market conditions, the vendor\u2019s credit status, or our financial position, it could adversely affect liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Form 10-K for more information related to the Company\u2019s credit facility.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the stock is thinly traded, which may cause investors to lose most or part of their investment in our common stock.\nThe stock market may experience volatility that is often unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies. If market-sector or industry-based fluctuations occur, our stock price could decline regardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose a substantial part of their investments. Moreover, if an active public market for our common stock is not sustained in the future, it may be difficult to resell such stock. Generally, our stock is thinly traded. When trading volumes are low, a relatively small buy or sell order can result in a relatively large change in the trading price of our common stock and investors may not be able to sell their securities at a favorable price.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt operations.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key management personnel. While we have employment contracts in place with several of our executive officers, we nevertheless cannot be assured that we will retain our key employees and the loss of service of any of these officers or key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business growth and operating results.\nOur future success will require an ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for such key personnel is intense and we cannot be assured that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. We cannot make assurances that we will not have departures of key personnel in the future. Changes in the cost of providing pension and other employee benefits, including changes in health care costs, investment returns on plan assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could lead to increased costs in any of our operations.\nCertain of our U.S. government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with U.S. government requirements. If our employees are unable to obtain security clearances in a timely manner, or at all, or if our employees who hold security clearances are unable to maintain the clearances or terminate employment with us, then a customer requiring classified work could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. In addition, we expect that many of the contracts on which we will bid will require us to demonstrate our ability to obtain facility security clearances and employ personnel with specified types of security clearances.\nTo the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract, we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts, or effectively bid on expiring contracts.\nAdverse regulatory developments could harm our business.\nOur business operates and certain of our customers\u2019 businesses operate, in heavily regulated environments. We must manage the risk of changes in or adverse actions under applicable law or in our regulatory authorizations, licenses and permits, governmental security clearances, government procurement regulations or other legal rights in order to operate our business, manage our work force or import and export goods and services as needed. We also face the risk of other adverse regulatory actions, compliance costs or governmental sanctions. The regulations and regulatory bodies include, but are not limited to, the following: the Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals or misconduct by any of our employees could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the loss of security clearances, the loss of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government in general, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also additional risk factors relating to U.S. government contract audits, securities laws regulations, environmental law regulations and foreign law regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws, which expose us to potential liability.\nOur operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as well as analogous state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a significant consideration for us because we use various hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. We may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials, regardless of whether we caused the release, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws. In the event of contamination or violation of environmental laws, we could be held liable for damages including fines, penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits. Any such penalties or revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby harming our business. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product.\nThe Company has been involved with ongoing environmental remediation since the early 1980\u2019s related to one of its former manufacturing facilities, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico (\u201cCoors Road\u201d). Uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes. Estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly. Normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time. Rather, the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability. Factors which cause uncertainties for the Company include, but are not limited to, the effectiveness of the current work plans in achieving targeted results and proposals of regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes. It is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes associated with the ultimate resolution of this contingency. At July 2, 2017, the Company estimates that it is reasonably possible, but not probable, that future environmental remediation costs associated with the Company\u2019s past operations at the Coors Road property, in excess of amounts already recorded, could be up to $2.5 million before income taxes over the next thirteen years, with this amount expected to be offset by related reimbursement from the United States Department of Energy for a net amount of $1.6 million.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in certain other existing compliance issues with the EPA and various state agencies, including being named as a potentially responsible party at several sites. Potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\") can be held jointly and severally liable for the clean-up costs at any specific site. The Company\u2019s past experience, however, has indicated that when it has contributed relatively small amounts of materials or waste to a specific site relative to other PRPs, its ultimate share of any clean-up costs has been minor. Based upon available information, the Company believes it has contributed only small amounts to those sites in which it is currently viewed as a PRP and that reasonably possible losses related to these compliance issues are immaterial.\nThe occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable.\nOur business activities expose us to risks of litigation with respect to our customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders, product liability, intellectual property infringement or environmental-related matters. We may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims. Any litigation, even a claim without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we maintain insurance policies, we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, we may be adversely affected.\nOur success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. However, a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology. Moreover, existing U.S. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. The laws of countries other than the United States may be even less protective of intellectual property rights. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nIncreased international political instability, evidenced by threats and occurrence of terrorist attacks, conflicts in the Middle East and Asia and strained international relations arising from these conflicts, may hinder our ability to do business. The political environment in communist countries can contribute to the threat of instability. While we have not been adversely affected as yet due to this exposure, one of our facilities is based in Vietnam, which is a communist country. These events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economies, particularly customer confidence and spending, which in turn could affect our revenue and results of operations. The impact of these events on the volatility of the U.S. and world financial markets could increase the volatility of our securities and may limit the capital resources available to us, our customers and our suppliers.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters, disease and other business disruptions, including earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, fires, pandemic outbreaks and other natural or manmade disasters, which could seriously harm our financial condition and increase our expenses. In the past, hurricanes have adversely impacted the performance of two of our production facilities located in Florida. We have a production facility outside Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This area, in the tropics and close to the sea, may be vulnerable to storms, floods and typhoons.\nOperations outside of the United States may be affected by legal and regulatory risks and government reviews, inquiries or investigations could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations in both Vietnam and Canada and the business it conducts outside the United States are subject to risks relating to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the United States as well as in local jurisdictions. Additionally, there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls. From time to time, the Company may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, the Company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Company\u2019s operations or activities are not in compliance with United States laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or various international laws and regulations could expose the Company to significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the Company.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the companies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. The report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company\u2019s financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, if the company\u2019s public equity float remains above certain thresholds.\nWe are continuing our comprehensive efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this could lead us to issue a financial restatement or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations to the SEC, or could result in a finding by our independent auditors of a significant deficiency or material weakness in our controls over financial reporting, which, in turn, could result in an adverse reaction to our stock in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nThe efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected by disruptions to our information technology (IT) services and cyber incidents.\nWe rely in part on various IT systems to manage our operations and to provide analytical information to management. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers, depends on information technology. We are exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business and we have been the subject of such cyber incidents. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property, money or sensitive information (including our customers) or may be the result of unintentional events. Like most companies, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power and/or telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company's risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company's operations are not disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to our reputation, litigation, inefficiencies or production down-times, increased cyber security protection and remediation costs, including potential exposure to customers. Such consequences could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customers\u2019 orders, resulting in a delay or decrease to our revenue and a reduction to our operating margins.\nOur operating results may be subject to seasonality.\nWhile overall sales can fluctuate during the year in each of our segments, revenues from our MDS segment are typically higher in the second half of the Company's fiscal year. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, mainly timing of customer demand.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase operating costs.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s operations and some customers are in foreign locations. While a significant portion of the Company's transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions occur in other currencies. Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors and cannot be easily predicted. Volatility in the U.S. dollar could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition and could affect our ability to maintain or grow our revenues with international customers. Additionally, currency exchange fluctuations related to the remeasurement of the Company\u2019s Canadian and Vietnamese financial statements into U.S. dollars could have a negative impact on our reported results. The Company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation and unexpected expenses could occur from future fluctuations in exchange rates.\nOur growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks of acquisitions and risks relating to integration.\nOur growth strategy has included acquiring complementary businesses. If such a strategy was determined to be necessary in the future, we could fail to identify, finance or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices. Acquisitions and the related integration process could increase a number of risks, including diversion of operations personnel, financial personnel and management\u2019s attention, difficulties in integrating systems and operations, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies and exposure to unanticipated liabilities. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value realized and we cannot provide any assurances of expected synergies and benefits of any acquisition. Our discovery of, or failure to discover, material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets, either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations, or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations or warranties, could materially harm our business. Acquisitions also may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial position and operating results. As a result of such integration risks, as well as other factors, the Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $64.2 million in its MDS segment in fiscal 2016.", "PERMNO": 17523, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "SPA"}
