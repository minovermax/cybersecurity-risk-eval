RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations or financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Before investing in our Common Stock you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the financial and other information contained in this Report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our Common Stock would likely decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Only those investors who can bear the risk of loss of their entire investment should invest in our Common Stock.\nThis Report contains certain statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of our company. Prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating such statements, prospective investors should specifically consider the various factors identified in this Report, including the matters set forth below, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.\nIf any of the following or other risks materialize, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could adversely impact the value of our Common Stock. In such a case, investors in our Common Stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nProspective investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Company is suitable for them in light of the information contained in this Report and the financial resources available to them. The risks described below do not purport to be all the risks to which the Company or the Company could be exposed. This section is a summary of certain risks and is not set out in any particular order of priority. They are the risks that we presently believe are material to the operations of the Company. Additional risks of which we are not presently aware or which we presently deem immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our business and future prospects.\nWe are an early stage company that has not yet begun any commercial operations. Historically, we have been a shell company with no operating history and no assets other than cash. Upon consummation of the Merger with Akoustis, we redirected our business focus towards the development of advanced single crystal bulk acoustic wave filter products for RF front-ends for use in mobile wireless device industry. Although Akoustis since its inception focused its activity on research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) of high efficiency acoustic wave resonator technology utilizing single crystal piezoelectric materials, this technology has not yet obtained marketing approval or been verified in commercial manufacturing, and its RF filters have not generated any sales.\nSince our potential customers and future demand for our products are based on estimates of planned operations rather than experience, it is difficult for our management and our investors to accurately forecast and evaluate our future prospects and our revenues. Our proposed operations are therefore subject to all of the risks inherent in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of any new business, the development of a product, as well as those risks that are specific to our business in particular. An investment in an early stage company such as ours involves a degree of risk, including the possibility that entire investment may be lost. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that following the Merger, we will not be able to develop functional and scalable products, or that although functional and scalable, our products and/or services will not be accepted in the market. To successfully introduce and market our products at a profit, we must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for our products. There are no assurances that the Company can successfully address these challenges. If it is unsuccessful, the Company and its business, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not generate revenues or achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to have negative cash flow from operations. We have never generated any revenues; our only income has been from R&D grants. We have experienced net losses of approximately $4.16 million for the period from May 12, 2014 (inception) to March 31, 2016. Our future profitability will depend on our ability to create a sustainable business model and generate revenues, which is subject to a number of factors, including our ability to successfully implement our strategies and execute our R&D plan, our ability to implement our improved design and cost reductions into manufacturing of our RF filters, the availability of funding, market acceptance of our products, consumer demand for end products incorporating our products, our ability to compete effectively in a crowded field, our ability to respond effectively to technological advances by timely introducing our new technologies and products and global economic and political conditions.\nOur future profitability also depends on our expense levels, which are influenced by a number of factors, including the resources we devote to developing and supporting our projects and potential products, the continued progress of our research and development of potential products, our ability to improve research and development efficiencies, license fees or royalties we may be required to pay, and the potential need to acquire licenses to new technology, the availability of intellectual property for licensing or acquisition, or to use our technology in new markets, which could require us to pay unanticipated license fees and royalties in connection with these licenses.\nOur development and commercialization efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues to offset higher expenses. These expenses, among other things, may cause our net income and working capital to decrease. If we fail to generate revenue and manage our expenses, we may never achieve profitability, which would adversely and materially affect our ability to provide a return to our investors\nThe industry and the markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change.\nThe markets in which we intend to compete are intensely competitive. We will operate primarily in the industry that designs and produces semiconductor components for wireless communications and other wireless devices, which is subject to rapid changes in both product and process technologies based on demand and evolving industry standards. The intended markets for our products are characterized by:\n\u00b7 rapid technological developments and product evolution,\n\u00b7 rapid changes in customer requirements,\n\u00b7 frequent new product introductions and enhancements,\n\u00b7 continuous demand for higher levels of integration, decreased size and decreased power consumption,\n\u00b7 short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the product, and\n\u00b7 evolving industry standards.\nThe continuous evolutions of these technologies and frequent introduction of new products and enhancements have generally resulted in short product life cycles for wireless semiconductor products, in general, and for RF front-end products, in particular. Our products could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the above-noted factors. Therefore, in order for our RF filters to be competitive and achieve market acceptance, we need to keep pace with rapid development of new process technologies, which requires us to:\n\u00b7 respond effectively to technological advances by timely introducing our new technologies and products,\n\u00b7 successfully implement our strategies and execute our R&D plan in practice,\n\u00b7 improve the efficiency of our technology,\n\u00b7 implement our improved design and cost reductions into manufacturing of our RF filters.\nOur products may not be accepted in the market.\nAlthough we believe that our Bulk ONE acoustic wave resonator technology that utilizes single crystal piezoelectric materials will provide material advantages over existing RF filters and are currently developing various methods of integration suitable for implementation of this technology to RF filters, we cannot be certain that our RF filters will be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance. While we have fabricated R&D resonators that demonstrate the feasibility of our Bulk ONE technology, we are still in the process of transitioning this technology into a production-capable wafer fabrication facility for manufacturing of our RF filters, and this technology is not verified yet in practice or on a commercial scale. There are also no records that can demonstrate our ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields. In addition to our limited operating history, we will depend on a limited number of manufacturers and customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Each of these factors may adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business goals.\nThe successful development of our Bulk ONE technology following the Merger and market acceptance of our RF filters will be highly complex and will depend on the following principal competitive factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 comply with industry standards and effectively compete against current technology for producing RF acoustic wave filters,\n\u00b7 differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors by delivering RF filters that are higher in quality, reliability and technical performance,\n\u00b7 anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards and timely develop improved technologies that meet high levels of satisfaction of our potential customers,\n\u00b7 maintain, grow and manage our internal teams to the extent we increase our operations and develop new segments of our business,\n\u00b7 develop and maintain successful collaboration, strategic, and other relationships with manufacturers, customers and contractors,\n\u00b7 protect, develop or otherwise obtain adequate intellectual property for our technology and our filters; and\n\u00b7 obtain strong financial, sales, marketing, technical and other resources necessary to develop, test, manufacture, commercialize and market our filters.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. As a result, our Bulk ONE technology and our RF filters may not be accepted in the market and we may never attain profitability.\nWe will face intense competition, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will compete with U.S. and international semiconductor manufacturers and fabless mobile semiconductor companies of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, some of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect competition in our markets to intensify, as new competitors enter the RF component market, existing competitors merge or form alliances, and new technologies emerge. Our competitors may introduce new solutions and technologies that are superior to our BAW technology, are verified on a commercial scale, and have achieved widespread market acceptance. Certain of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. This implementation may require us to modify the manufacturing process for our filters, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products, which may prove difficult for us and result in delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.\nIncreased competition could also result in pricing pressures, declining average selling prices for our RF filters, decreased gross margins and loss of market share. We will need to make substantial investments to develop these enhancements and technologies, and we cannot assure investors that we will have funds available for these investments or that these enhancements and technologies will be successful. If a competing technology emerges that is, or is perceived to be, superior to our existing technology and we are unable to adapt to these changes and to compete effectively, our market share and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our business, revenue, and results of operations could be harmed.\nChanges in general economic conditions, together with other factors, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry, and our business, therefore, may also experience cyclical fluctuations in the future.\nFrom time to time, changes in general economic conditions, together with other factors, may cause significant upturns and downturns in the semiconductor industry. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7 levels of inventory in our end markets,\n\u00b7 availability and cost of supply for manufacturing of our RF filters using our design,\n\u00b7 changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured with our technology and sold by our prospective customers,\n\u00b7 industry production capacity levels and fluctuations in industry manufacturing yields,\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our future customers\u2019 products that incorporate our RF filters,\n\u00b7 the gain or loss of significant customers,\n\u00b7 the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our RF filters,\n\u00b7 new product and technology introductions by competitors,\n\u00b7 changes in the mix of products produced and sold, and\n\u00b7 intellectual property disputes.\nAs a result, the demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate, and our business, therefore, may also experience cyclical fluctuations in the future operating results. In addition, future downturns in the electronic systems industry could adversely impact our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our business.\nAs the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on the continued services of our current key officers, employees, and Board members, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced technical personnel. The loss of their services could have a detrimental effect on our operations. Specifically, the loss of the services of Jeffrey Shealy, our President and CEO, Prof. Steve DenBaars, our director, Mark Boomgarden, our Vice President of Operations, David Aichele, our Vice President of Business Development, Prof. James Shealy, the Chair of our Scientific Advisor Board, Cindy Payne, our Chief Financial Officer, Richard Ogawa, our Patent Counsel, any major change in our Board or management, or our inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the wireless semiconductor industry, and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products.\nWe expect to substantially rely on third parties to manufacture our RF filters.\nWe employ a \u201cfabless\u201d business strategy, meaning that we do not own a semiconductor fabrication facility, or fab, and do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally, such as our own manufacturing facilities, to manufacture our wafers and our filters for use in the conduct of commercial quantities. Instead, we leverage capital investments and capacity of manufacturers to fabricate our wafers. Therefore, success of implementation of our single-crystal BAW technology for manufacturing our RF filters and its commercial production will substantially depend upon our ability to develop, maintain and expand our strategic relationships with manufacturers that will fabricate wafers using our design and incorporate them into their products. Any impairment in our relationship with these manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Although we have entered into a joint development agreement and a foundry agreement with Global Communication Semiconductors, LLC (\u201cGCS\u201d), and may explore other plans to enter into agreements with more manufacturers, to fabricate our RF filters for R&D and for commercial sales, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain those relationships on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Since we expect to depend upon one or a limited number of these manufacturers for a signification portion of our revenue in the future, we could experience delays in the launch and commercial productions of our RF filters if we are unable to maintain those relationships.\nReliance on a limited number of manufacturers also may expose us to the following risks:\n\u00b7 We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for manufacturing of our wafers.\n\u00b7 Our manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture wafers in the volume and of the quality required to meet demands of our R&D and commercial needs.\n\u00b7 Our future manufacturers may not perform as contractually agreed or may not remain in the manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.\n\u00b7 Since our filters are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components of other products, we highly depend upon selection of our design and technology by these manufacturers from among alternative offerings and including and incorporating our filters into their final product.\nEach of these risks could delay the commercialization of our RF filters and its market acceptance or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nWe rely on our independent contractors in adequately performing their contractual obligations, meeting expected deadlines and applicable regulatory requirements\nWe depend on our independent contractors to adequately perform a substantial part of our projects and successfully carry their contractual duties and obligations. However, these contractors may not assign as a great priority a process of developing of our technology in accordance with our levels of quality control or meet expected deadlines, may not devote sufficient time to develop our technology, or may not pursue their contractual obligations as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such activities ourselves. They may also establish relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our contractors assist our competitors to our detriment, our competitive position would be harmed. If our independent contractors fail to perform their contractual duties at acceptable quality levels or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to a failure to adhere to our protocols, legal and regulatory requirements or for other reasons, the development and commercialization of our filters could be stopped, delayed, or made less profitable. As a result, our operations and the commercial prospects for marketing of our RF filters would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nProduct defects could adversely affect the results of our operations and may expose us to product liability claims.\nThe fabrication of the RF filters is a complex and precise process. While we intend to supply design and to monitor fabrication of our RF filters by our manufacturers, we may not be able to monitor their quality control, their quality assurance and their qualified personnel. If any of our manufacturers fail to successfully manufacture wafers that conform to our design specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), it may result in substantial risk of undetected flaws in components or other materials used by our manufacturers during fabrication of our filters and could lead to product defects and costs to repair or replace these parts or materials. Any such failure by our manufacturers would significantly impact our ability to develop and implement our technology and to improve performance of our RF filters. Our inability to timely find a substitute manufacturer that can comply with such requirements could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.\nWe also could be subject to product liability lawsuits if the wireless devices containing our RF filters cause injury. Recently interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product or inadequate disclosure of risks related to the use of our product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nIf we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our RF filters, we may not be able to effectively generate product revenues.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and currently have no internal marketing and sales force. In order to launch and commercialize our technology and our RF filters, we must build on a territory-by-territory basis marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. Therefore, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If so, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, such collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products.\nIf we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our filters. Further, to the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. If we decide in the future to establish an internal sales and marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our RF filters, it could be expensive and time consuming and would require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. We may also not have sufficient resources to allocate to the sales and marketing of our filters. Any failure or delay in the development of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either through collaboration with one or more third parties or through internal efforts, would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our products that we obtain approval to market. As a result, our future product revenue would suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies and may lose access to technologies critical to our products.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products which, in turn, largely depends on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection and to enforce our proprietary rights without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While we rely upon a combination of our patent applications currently pending with the United State Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), our trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies, there can be no assurance that\n\u00b7 our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents,\n\u00b7 our limited patent portfolio will provide adequate protection to our core technology,\n\u00b7 we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions, or\n\u00b7 we can prevent third parties from disclosure or misappropriation of our proprietary information which could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding any competitive advantage we may derive from the proprietary information.\nWe have a limited number of patent applications which may not result in issued patents.\nIn the United States, we have seven pending patent applications, one filing for which claims have been allowed and one filing that was published on June 7, 2016; however, there is no assurance that any of the pending applications or our future patent applications will result in patents being issued, or that any patents that may be issued as a result of existing or future applications will provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.\nThe process of seeking patent protection in the United States and abroad can be long and expensive. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain at the time of filing that we are the first to file any patent application related to our single crystal acoustic wave filter technology. In addition, patent applications are often published as part of the patent application process, even if such applications do not issue as patents. When published, such applications will become publicly available, and proprietary information disclosed in the application will become available to others. While at present we are unaware of competing patent applications, competing applications could potentially surface.\nEven if all of our pending patent applications are granted and result in registration of our patents, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced, or that the scope of any patent rights could provide a sufficient degree of protection that could permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage with respect to these products and technologies. For example, we cannot predict:\n\u00b7 the degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to make, use, sell, offer to sell or import competitive products without infringing our patents;\n\u00b7 if and when patents will be issued;\n\u00b7 if third parties will obtain patents claiming inventions similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications;\n\u00b7 if third parties have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing our own patented products and practicing our own technology; or\n\u00b7 whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings (e.g. at the USPTO) in connection with patent rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose.\nAs a result, the patent applications we own may fail to result in issued patents in the United States. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any issued patents or issued to us in the future, which may result in those patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from developing similar products that do not infringe the claims made in our patents. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue is threatened, we may not be able to prevent others from offering similar technology and products in the RF front-ends mobile market and our ability to commercialize our RF filters with technology protected by those patents could be threatened.\nWe have three pending patent applications and an additional three patent applications which have been issued outside of the United States. The three issued applications entered the divisional process and are anticipated to result in up to six granted patents outside of the United States. However, our pending patent applications may fail to result in issued patents outside of the United States which may significantly limit our ability to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights in countries outside of the United States where our filters may be sold in the future. If we file foreign patent applications related to our pending U.S. patent applications or to our issued patents in the United States, if any, these applications may be contested and fail to result in issued patents outside of the United States or we will be required to narrow our claims. Even if some or all of our patent applications are granted outside of the United States and resulted in the issued patents, effective enforcement of rights granted by these patents in some countries may not be available due to the differences in foreign patent and other laws concerning intellectual property rights, a relatively weak legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in these countries, and because it is difficult, expensive and time-consuming to police unauthorized use of our intellectual property when infringers are overseas. This failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights outside of the United States could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our potential licensors. To attempt to stop infringement or unauthorized use, we may need to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and distract management.\nIf we pursue any infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the relevant technology on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Additionally, any enforcement of our patents may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. Some of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, which could reduce the likelihood of success of, or the amount of damages that could be awarded resulting from, any infringement proceeding we pursue in any such jurisdiction. To date, we have not filed any patent applications in jurisdictions other than the United States. An adverse result in any infringement litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, which could limit the ability of our filters to compete in those jurisdictions.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to use it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe need to protect our trademark rights and disclosure of our trade secrets to prevent competitors taking advantage of our goodwill.\nWe believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand, maintaining goodwill, and maintaining or increasing market share. We currently have two trademarks that we have filed to register with USPTO, the Akoustis\u2122 and Bulk ONE\u2122 marks, and may expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to register new trademarks and maintain and enforce our trademark rights. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired.\nThird parties may claim that the sale or promotion of our products, when and if we have any, may infringe on the trademark rights of others. Trademark infringement problems occur frequently in connection with the sale and marketing of products in the RFFE mobile industry. If we become involved in any dispute regarding our trademark rights, regardless of whether we prevail, we could be required to engage in costly, distracting and time-consuming litigation that could harm our business. If the trademarks we use are found to infringe upon the trademark of another company, we could be liable for damages and be forced to stop using those trademarks, and as result, we could lose all the goodwill that has been developed in those trademarks.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents and trademarks, we seek to rely on copyright, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. For Akoustis, this includes particularly chip layouts, circuit designs, resonator layouts and implementation, and membrane definition. Although we require all of our employees and certain consultants and advisors to assign inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be disclosed or competitors may otherwise gain access to such information or independently develop substantially equivalent information. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain the competitive advantage that we believe is provided by such intellectual property, which would weaken our competitive market position, and materially adversely affect our business and operational results.\nDevelopment of certain technologies with our manufacturers may result in restrictions on jointly-developed intellectual property.\nIn order to maintain and expand our strategic relationship with manufacturers of our filters, we may, from time to time, develop certain technologies jointly with these manufacturers and file for further intellectual property protection and/or seek to commercialize such technologies. We entered into the Joint Development Agreement with GCS and may enter in the future into joint development agreements with other manufacturers which provide(s) for the joint development works and joint intellectual property rights by us and by such manufacturer. Such agreements may restrict our commercial use of such intellectual property, or may require written consent from, or a separate agreement with, that manufacturer. In other cases, we may not have any rights to use intellectual property solely developed and owned by such manufacturer or another third party. If we cannot obtain commercial use rights for such jointly-owned intellectual property or intellectual property solely owned by these manufacturers, our future product development and commercialization plans may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of third party intellectual property that, regardless of merit, could result in significant expense and loss of our intellectual property rights.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by the vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights. We have not undertaken a comprehensive review of the rights of third parties in our field. From time to time, we may receive notices or inquiries from third parties regarding our products or the manner in which we conduct our business suggesting that we may be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise misusing patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights. Any claims that our technology infringe, misappropriate or otherwise misuse the rights of third parties, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be expensive to litigate or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, cause significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of our business. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\u00b7 pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we were held to have willfully infringed;\n\u00b7 cease the manufacture, offering for sale or sale of the infringing technology or processes;\n\u00b7 expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or processes;\n\u00b7 obtain a license from a third party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all; or\n\u00b7 lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others.\nIn addition, our agreements with prospective customers and manufacturing partners may require us to indemnify such customers and manufacturing partners for third party intellectual property infringement claims. Pursuant to such agreements, we may be required to defend such customers and manufacturing partners against certain claims that could cause us to incur additional costs. While we endeavor to include as part of such indemnification obligations a provision permitting us to assume the defense of any indemnification claim, not all of our current agreements contain such a provision and we cannot provide any assurance that our future agreements will contain such a provision, which could result in increased exposure to us in the case of an indemnification claim.\nDefense of any intellectual property infringement claims against us, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a significant diversion of resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, limit our business to avoid the infringing activities, pay royalties and/or redesign our infringing technology dates or alter related formulations, processes, methods or other technologies, any or all of which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. The occurrence of any of the above events could prevent us from continuing to develop and commercialize our filters and our business could materially suffer.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of losses, will need substantial additional funding to continue our operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We have incurred losses since our incorporation and formation in 2014. Although we are applying for substantial additional grants in the calendar year 2016 and 2017 that we believe we are likely to be awarded, and we are launching a sales channel for non-resonator catalog parts in 2016, both of which are expected to provide cash flows to help support the development and commercialization of our resonator technology, we do not expect meaningful revenues from our resonator technology until at least the second half of the calendar year 2017. If our forecasts for the Company prove incorrect, the business, operating results and financial condition of the Company will be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue the development of our patent-pending single crystal acoustic wave filter technology, invest in marketing, sales and distribution of our RF filters to grow our business, acquire customers, commercialize our technology in the mobile wireless market. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in generating sufficient revenues to offset these higher expenses. In addition, we expect to incur significant expenses related to regulatory requirements, ability to obtain, protect, and defend our intellectual property right.\nWe may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may increase our capital needs and/or cause us to spend our cash resources faster than we expect. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to continue our operations.\nTo date, we have financed our operations through a mix of investments from private investors, the incurrence of debt, and grant funding, and we expect to continue to utilize such means of financing for the foreseeable future. Additional funding from those or other sources may not be available when or in the amounts needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise capital through the sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, it would result in dilution to our then existing stockholders, which could be significant depending on the price at which we may be able to sell our securities. If we raise additional capital through the incurrence of indebtedness, we would likely become subject to covenants restricting our business activities, and holders of debt instruments may have rights and privileges senior to those of our equity investors. In addition, servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities could divert funds that would otherwise be available to support research and development, or commercialization activities. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our R&D programs for our acoustic wave filter technology or any future commercialization efforts. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects, and could cause our business to fail.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s historical financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring net losses and accumulated deficit and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity financing or other capital, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. However, if adequate funds are not available to us when we need them, and we are unable to commercialize our products giving us access to additional cash resources, we will be required to curtail our operations, which would, in turn, further raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisk Related to Managing Any Growth We May Experience\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our shareholders and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we currently have no specific plans to acquire any other businesses, we may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our current business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company. In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may:\n\u00b7 issue Common Stock or other forms of equity that would dilute our existing shareholders\u2019 percentage of ownership,\n\u00b7 incur debt and assume liabilities, and\n\u00b7 incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs.\nWe may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that it will be viewed positively by customers, financial markets or investors. Furthermore, future acquisitions could pose numerous additional risks to our expected operations, including:\n\u00b7 problems integrating the purchased business, products or technologies,\n\u00b7 challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits,\n\u00b7 increases to our expenses,\n\u00b7 the assumption of significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying party,\n\u00b7 inability to maintain relationships with prospective key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses,\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from their day-to-day responsibilities,\n\u00b7 difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration,\n\u00b7 entrance into marketplaces where we have no or limited prior experience and where competitors have stronger marketplace positions,\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity, and\n\u00b7 that historical financial information may not be representative or indicative of our results as a combined company.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, and our operations are vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, terrorist activity, power loss and other events beyond our control, the occurrence of which could materially harm our business.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access as well as telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our R&D. If any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and/or the further development of our new technology for RF filters could be delayed.\nWe are also vulnerable to accidents, electrical blackouts, labor strikes, terrorist activities, war and other natural disasters and other events beyond our control, and we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business as a result of any such events and do not have an applicable recovery plan in place. We currently do not carry other business interruption insurance that would compensate us for actual losses from interruptions of our business that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could cause our business to materially suffer.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Requirements\nWireless communication industry is subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and review. Maintaining compliance with these requirements may result in significant additional expense to us, and any failure to maintain such compliance could cause our business to suffer.\nOur business and products in development are subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies, including the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the FCC, the consumer protection laws of the Federal Trade Commission, the import/export regulatory activities of the Department of Commerce, the product safety regulatory activities of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the environmental regulatory activities of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe rules and regulations of the FCC limit the RF used by and level of power emitting from electronic equipment. Our RF filters, as a key element enabling consumer electronic smartphone equipment, are required to comply with these FCC rules, and may require certification, verification or registration of our RF filters with the FCC. Certification and verification of new equipment requires testing to ensure the equipment\u2019s compliance with the FCC\u2019s rules. The equipment must be labeled according to the FCC\u2019s rules to show compliance with these rules. Testing, processing of the FCC\u2019s equipment certificate or FCC registration and labeling may increase development and production costs and could delay the implementation of our Bulk ONE acoustic wave resonator technology for our RF filters and the launch and commercial productions of our filters into the U.S. market. Electronic equipment permitted or authorized to be used by us through FCC certification or verification procedures must not cause harmful interference to licensed FCC users, and may be subject to RF interference from licensed FCC users. Selling, leasing or importing non-compliant equipment is considered a violation of FCC rules and federal law, and violators may be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition by increasing our compliance costs and/or limiting our sales in the United States.\nThe semiconductor and electronics industries also have been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been used in our products in development or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires that certain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removing such substances requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. Our cost to maintain compliance with existing environmental regulations is expected to be nominal based on our business structure in which we outsource a majority of our operations to suppliers that are responsible for meeting environmental regulations. We will continue to monitor our quality program and expand as required to maintain compliance and ability to audit our supply chain.\nNoncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. These enforcement actions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees.\nThere could be an adverse change or increase in the laws and/or regulations governing our business.\nWe and our operating subsidiary are subject to various laws and regulations in different jurisdictions, and the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations are subject to change. We also will be subject to different tax regulations in each of the jurisdictions where we will conduct our business or where our management or the management of our operating subsidiary is located. We expect that the scope and extent of regulation in these jurisdictions, as well as regulatory oversight and supervision, will generally continue to increase. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes in any jurisdiction will not have a material adverse effect on us or hinder us in the operation of its business. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to us.\nThese current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts or impact the research activities we pursue. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could cause our financial condition to suffer.\nInvestment Risks\nYou could lose all of your investment.\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Potential investors should be aware that the value of an investment in the Company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in the Company will fully reflect its underlying value. You could lose your entire investment.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and the purchasers of our Common Stock offered hereby. The Company is authorized to issue an aggregate of 300,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. We may issue additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our Common Stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Common Stock. We will need to raise additional capital in the near future to meet our working capital needs, and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with these capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price you paid for your stock.\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nOur Board of Directors will be authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the Board to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the Board of Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent managers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nThere currently is a limited market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that an active public market will ever develop. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our Common Stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.\nThere is currently only a very limited public market for shares of our Common Stock, and an active trading market may never develop. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Markets. The OTC Markets is a thinly traded market and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience. We may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our Common Stock to be listed on a national securities exchange, which is often a more widely-traded and liquid market. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our Common Stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders\u2019 equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our Common Stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our Common Stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our Common Stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our Common Stock is otherwise rejected for listing, and remains listed on the OTC Markets or is suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price of our Common Stock could suffer and the trading market for our Common Stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nOur Common Stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our Common Stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOur stock may be traded infrequently and in low volumes, so you may be unable to sell your shares at or near the quoted bid prices if you need to sell your shares.\nUntil our Common stock is listed on a national securities exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, we expect our Common Stock to remain eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets, or on another over-the-counter quotation system, or in the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d In those venues, however, the shares of our Common Stock may trade infrequently and in low volumes, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Common Stock or to sell his or her shares at or near bid prices or at all. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our Common Stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our Common Stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock, and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nCash dividends have never been declared or paid on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of Common Stock. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. Since we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with the effective dates of those accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (2) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (3) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (4) March 31, 2020, the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nEven after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements. Some investors may find our Common Stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nBeing a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management, and increases our expenses. Among other things, we are required to:\n\u00b7 maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u00b7 maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u00b7 prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws;\n\u00b7 institute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with respect to corporate governance; and\n\u00b7 involve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors, particularly directors willing to serve on an audit committee which we expect to establish.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, at such time, if any, as we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm will have to attest to and report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting. Based upon the last evaluation conducted as of March 31, 2016, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. In addition, management noted that the last evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting in place as of March 31, 2016 indicated the controls to be effective.\nAlthough our management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2016, if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they may decline to attest to management\u2019s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our Common Stock.\nIn particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and (if required in future) our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group or an audit committee composed of independent directors of the Board, and we will need to retain the services of additional accounting and financial staff or consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404. We intend to review the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and make any changes management determines appropriate, including to achieve compliance with Section 404 by the date on which we are required to so comply.\n***\nThe risks above do not necessarily comprise all of those associated with an investment in the Company.
