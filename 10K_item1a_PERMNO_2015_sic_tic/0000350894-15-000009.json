{"cik": "350894", "company": "SEI INVESTMENTS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe believe that the risks and uncertainties described below are those that impose the greatest threat to the sustainability of our business. However, there are other risks and uncertainties that exist that may be unknown to us or, in the present opinion of our management, do not currently pose a material risk of harm to us. The risk and uncertainties facing our business, including those described below, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur revenues and earnings are affected by changes in capital markets. A majority of our revenues are earned based on the value of assets invested in investment products that we manage or administer. Significant fluctuations in securities prices may materially affect the value of these assets and may also influence an investor\u2019s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in a mutual fund or other investment product. As a result, our revenues and earnings derived from assets under management and administration could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on third party pricing services for the valuation of securities invested in our investment products. The majority of the securities held by our investment products are valued using quoted prices from active markets gathered by external third party pricing services. Securities for which market prices are not readily available are valued in accordance with procedures applicable to that investment product. These procedures may utilize unobservable inputs that are not gathered from any active markets and involve considerable judgment. If these valuations prove to be inaccurate, our revenues and earnings from assets under management could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to product development risk. We continually strive to increase revenues and meet our customers' needs by introducing new products and services. As a result, we are subject to product development risk, which may result in loss if we are unable to develop and deliver products to our target markets that address our clients' needs and that are developed on a timely basis and reflect an attractive value proposition. The majority of our product development risk pertains to the SEI Wealth Platform, our newest technology that serves U.K., European and U.S. clients. It is designed to drive our entry into global private bank and wealth services markets and expand our U.S. market opportunity, improve client experience capabilities and strengthen operating efficiencies by providing straight through business processing solutions and transform the front, middle and back office operations that exist today. New product development is primarily for the purpose of enhancing our competitive position in the industry. In the event that we fail to develop products or services at an acceptable cost or on a timely basis or if we fail to deliver products and services which are of sound, economic value to our clients and our target markets, or an inability to support the product in a cost-effective and compliant manner, we may recognize significant financial losses.\nWe are dependent upon third-party service providers in our operations. We utilize numerous third-party service providers located in the United States, the United Kingdom and other offshore locations in our operations, in the development of new products, and in the maintenance of our proprietary systems. A failure by a third-party service provider could expose us to an inability to provide contractual services to our clients in a timely basis. Additionally, if a third-party service provider is unable\nPage 10 of 77\nto provide these services, we may incur significant costs to either internalize some of these services or find a suitable alternative.\nWe serve as the investment advisor for many of the products offered through our investment management programs and utilize the services of investment sub-advisers to manage the majority of these assets. A failure in the performance of our due diligence processes and controls related to the supervision and oversight of these firms in detecting and addressing conflicts of interest, fraudulent activity, noncompliance with relevant securities and other laws could cause us to suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation.\nWe are exposed to operational risks. Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, inefficiencies in our operational business units, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes. We operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process large volumes of transactions often within short time frames. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, we continue to enhance policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk.\nWe are exposed to systems and technology risks. Through our proprietary systems, we maintain and process data for our clients that is critical to their business operations. An unanticipated interruption of service may have significant ramifications, such as lost data, damaged software codes, or inaccurate processing of transactions. As a result, the costs necessary to rectify these problems may be substantial. Our continued success also depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and solutions and to defend against infringement claims of others. We primarily rely upon trade secret law, software security measures, copyrights and confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees, vendors and customers. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of trade secrets, copyrights and the rapid issuance of patents, as well as frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights of others. A successful assertion by others of infringement claims or a failure to maintain the confidentiality and exclusivity of our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are exposed to data and cyber security risks. A failure to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of client data and our proprietary data from the infiltration by an unauthorized user may lead to modifications or theft of critical and sensitive data pertaining to us or our clients. We have established a strategy designed to protect against threats and vulnerabilities containing preventive and detective controls including, but not limited to, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, computer forensics, vulnerability scanning, server hardening, penetration testing, anti-virus software, data leak prevention, encryption and centralized event correlation monitoring. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our proprietary systems and information, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the methods used change frequently or are not recognized until launched. Additionally, security breaches or disruptions of our proprietary systems, or those of our service providers, could impact our ability to provide services to our clients, which could expose us to liability for damages which may not be covered by insurance, result in the loss of customer business, damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation. In addition, the failure to upgrade or maintain our computer systems, software and networks, as necessary, could also make us susceptible to breaches and unauthorized access and misuse. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify, investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from data and cyber security risks. Furthermore, even if not directed at us specifically, attacks on other financial institutions could disrupt the overall functioning of the financial system. As a result of the importance of communications and information systems to our business, we could also be adversely affected if attacks affecting our third party service providers impair our ability to process transactions and communicate with clients and counterparties.\nPoor investment performance may affect our revenues and earnings. Our ability to maintain our existing clients and attract new clients may be negatively affected if the performance of our mutual funds and other investment products, relative to market conditions and other comparable competitive investment products, is lower. Investors may decide to place their investable funds elsewhere which would reduce the amount of assets we manage resulting in a decrease in our revenues and earnings.\nOur earnings and cashflows are affected by the performance of LSV. We maintain a minority ownership interest in LSV which is a significant contributor to our earnings. We also receive partnership distribution payments from LSV on a quarterly basis which contribute to our operating cashflows. LSV is a registered investment advisor that provides investment advisory services to institutions, including pension plans and investment companies. LSV is a value-oriented, contrarian money manager offering a deep-value investment alternative utilizing a proprietary equity investment model to identify securities generally considered to be out of favor by the market. Volatility in the capital markets or poor investment performance on the part of LSV, on a relative basis or an absolute basis, could result in a significant reduction in their assets under management and revenues and a\nPage 11 of 77\nreduction in performance fees. Consequently, LSV's contribution to our earnings through our minority ownership as well as to our operating cashflows through LSV's partnership distribution payments could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we provided an unsecured guaranty for $45.0 million of the obligations of LSV Employee Group III in connection with their purchase of a partnership interest in LSV, of which $38.7 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2014. The ability of LSV Employee Group III to successfully repay their loan obligation subject to our guaranty is dependent upon the level of quarterly partnership distribution payments from LSV. In the event that LSV Employee Group III does not receive sufficient partnership distribution payments from LSV or is otherwise unable to meet all of their financial obligations regarding the loan, the lenders have the right to seek payment from us for the outstanding obligations. The repayment of such obligations related to our guaranty agreement may negatively affect our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur Company and our clients are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Our various business activities are conducted through entities which may be registered with or regulated by the SEC and CFTC as an investment advisor, a broker-dealer, a transfer agent, or an investment company, and with federal or state banking authorities as a trust company. Our broker-dealer is also a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and is subject to its rules and oversight. In addition, some of our foreign subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to the oversight of, regulatory authorities primarily in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Canada. Many of our clients are subject to substantial regulation by federal and state banking, securities or insurance authorities or the Department of Labor. Compliance with existing and future regulations, responding to and complying with recent regulatory activity affecting broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies and their service providers and financial institutions, and examination or other supervisory activities of our regulators or of the regulators of our clients, could have a significant impact on our operations or business or our ability to provide certain products or services.\nWe offer investment and banking products that also are subject to regulation by the federal and state securities and banking authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities, where applicable. Existing or future regulations that affect these products could lead to a reduction in sales of these products or an increase in the cost of providing these products.\nThe fees and assessments imposed on our regulated subsidiaries by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities could have a significant impact on us. In the current regulatory environment, the frequency and scope of regulatory reform may lead to an increase in fees and assessments resulting in increased expense, or an increase or change in regulatory requirements which could affect our operations and business.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory examinations and investigations. The financial services industry faces substantial regulatory risks and litigation. Like many firms operating within the financial services industry, we are experiencing a difficult regulatory environment across our markets. Our current scale and reach as a provider to the financial services industry; the increased regulatory oversight of the financial services industry generally; new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry and ever-changing regulatory interpretations of existing laws and regulations, have made this an increasingly challenging and costly regulatory environment in which to operate. These examinations or investigations could result in the identification of matters that may require remediation activities or enforcement proceedings by the regulator. The direct and indirect costs of responding to these examinations, or of defending ourselves in any litigation could be significant. Additionally, actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines and penalties. The outcome of litigation or regulatory action is inherently difficult to predict and could have an adverse effect on our ability to offer some of our products and services.\nConsolidation within our target markets may affect our business. Merger and acquisition activity between banks and other financial institutions could reduce the number of existing and prospective clients or reduce the amount of revenue we receive from retained clients. Consolidation activities may also cause larger institutions to internalize some or all of our services. These factors may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth in revenues and earnings.\nWe are dependent upon third party approvals. Many of the investment advisors through which we distribute our investment offerings are affiliated with independent broker-dealers or other networks, which have regulatory responsibility for the advisor\u2019s practice. As part of the regulatory oversight, these broker-dealers or networks must approve the use of our investment products by affiliated advisors within their networks. Failure to receive such approval, or the withdrawal of such approval, could adversely affect the marketing of our investment products.\nWe are subject to financial and non-financial covenants which may restrict our ability to manage liquidity needs. Our $300.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) contains financial and non-financial covenants. The non-financial covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, mergers and acquisitions, sale of assets and investments. In the event of default, we have restrictions on paying dividends and repurchasing our common stock. We have one financial covenant, the Leverage Ratio, which restricts the level of indebtedness we can incur to a maximum of 1.75 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). We believe our primary risk is with the financial covenant if\nPage 12 of 77\nwe were to incur significant unexpected losses that would impact the EBITDA calculation. This would increase the Leverage Ratio and restrict the amount we could borrow under the Credit Facility. A restriction on our ability to fully utilize our Credit Facility may negatively affect our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nChanges in, or interpretation of, accounting principles could affect our revenues and earnings. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retrospectively affect previously reported results.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws. We are subject to possible examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position.\nCurrency fluctuations could negatively affect our future revenues and earnings as our business grows globally. We operate and invest globally to expand our business into foreign markets. Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as the functional currency. As these businesses evolve, our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates may increase. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the value of our fixed-income investment securities. We own Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities for the sole purpose of satisfying applicable regulatory requirements imposed on our wholly-owned limited purpose federal thrift subsidiary, SPTC. The valuations of these securities are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rates during the past several years have remained relatively low. The effect of a rising interest rate environment may negatively impact the value of these securities and thereby negatively affect our financial position and earnings.\nWe rely on our executive officers and senior management. Most of our executive officers and senior management personnel do not have employment agreements with us. The loss of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our future operations.", "PERMNO": 68196, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "SEIC"}
