{"cik": "40888", "company": "AEROJET ROCKETDYNE HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion describes the material factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in us risky, and these risk factors should be considered carefully together with all other information in this Report, including the financial statements and notes thereto. This discussion does not include all risks that we face, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently not known to us, or that are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material. The occurrence of any of these factors, events, or uncertainties may, in ways we may or may not accurately predict, adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the price of our common stock, as well as our future business and financial results.\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Lockheed Martin will acquire us, as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including stockholder approval and regulatory approval. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or waived on a timely basis. If the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or waived on a timely basis, we may be unable to complete the Merger as quickly as expected or at all.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows: (i) we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of our common stock; (ii) some of management's attention will have been directed to the Merger instead of being directed to our own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; (iii) the manner in which customers, suppliers and other third parties perceive us may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect our ability to compete for business; (iv) we may experience negative reactions from employees; (v) we will have expended time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on our business; and (vi) we may be required, in certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $150 million, as provided in the Merger Agreement. In addition, any significant delay in consummating the Merger could have an adverse effect on our operating results and adversely affect our relationships with customers and suppliers and would likely lead to a significant diversion of management and employee attention.\nAdditionally, in approving the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a number of factors and potential benefits, including the fact that the merger consideration to be received by holders of common stock represented a significant premium over the last closing stock price prior to announcement of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, neither the Company nor the holders of our common stock will realize this benefit of the Merger. Moreover, we would also have nevertheless incurred substantial transaction-related fees and costs and the loss of management time and resources.\nOur ability to complete the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the Merger to be abandoned.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain closing conditions, including, among others, the approval by the holders of a majority of all our outstanding shares to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger, and the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other government authority or other legal restraint or prohibition that has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger or that makes consummation of the Merger illegal. We cannot assure you that the various closing conditions will be satisfied or will not result in the abandonment or delay of the Merger.\nIn addition, before the Merger may be completed, regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \"HSR Act\"), must be obtained. The regulatory review under the HSR Act may impose conditions on the granting of such approval. Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the completion of the Merger, and the conditions may result in the failure of a closing condition under the Merger Agreement. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, or may contain conditions on the completion of the Merger that are unacceptable to Lockheed Martin.\nExpenses related to the pending Merger are significant and will adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the pending Merger, including legal and investment banking fees. We expect these costs to have an adverse effect on our operating results. If the Merger is not consummated, we may under certain circumstances be required to pay to Lockheed Martin a termination fee of $150 million. Our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected if we were required to pay the termination fee.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties, litigation risk, and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Merger Agreement requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business and restricts us, without the consent of Lockheed Martin, from taking certain specified actions agreed by the parties to be outside the ordinary course of business until the pending Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business before completion of the Merger or, if the Merger is not completed, termination of the Merger Agreement. As of February 16, 2021, eight lawsuits challenging the Merger were filed on behalf of purported stockholders, as described in Note 8 to this Report. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other government authority or other legal restraint or prohibition that has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger or that makes consummation of the Merger illegal. Accordingly, if any of the plaintiffs is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective, or delay its becoming effective within the expected time frame.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management and other key employees and disrupt our business relationships, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Merger. If key employees depart and as we face additional uncertainties relating to the Merger, our business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and other third parties attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the Company. If key employees depart or if our existing business relationships suffer, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The adverse effects of such disruptions could be further exacerbated by any delay in the completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of us.\nThe Merger Agreement contains \"no shop\" provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or induce competing third-party proposals (or knowingly cooperate in connection with such third party proposals) for the acquisition of our stock or assets. In addition, before our Board of Directors withdraws, qualifies or modifies its recommendation on the Merger or terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into a third-party acquisition proposal, Lockheed Martin generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Merger. In some circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay a termination fee of $150 million.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if the acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or might otherwise result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than they might otherwise have proposed to pay due to the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we decide to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate or consummate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nPayment of the Pre-Closing Dividend will result in a significant outflow of cash and is not conditioned upon the closing of the Merger, which means that if the Merger fails to close after payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend, the Company will be required to operate with less liquidity than was previously available to us.\nThe Pre-Closing Dividend was declared by the Board of Directors in connection with the announcement of the Merger. The Pre-Closing Dividend will be paid on March 24, 2021, and is expected to result in the payment of an aggregate of $447.8 million. The Merger is not expected to close until the second half of 2021. If the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or waived on a timely basis, we may be unable to complete the Merger as quickly as expected or at all. As a result, we will be required to operate the business with less cash on hand than we would have had if the Pre-Closing Dividend had not been paid. This decrease in liquidity could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nReductions, delays or changes in U.S. government spending, including failure to timely appropriate funding, may reduce, delay or cancel certain programs in which we participate and as a result adversely affect our financial results.\nOur primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense, space and armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in a large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. President must propose and Congress must appropriate funds for a given program each GFY and may significantly change, increase, reduce or eliminate, funding for a program. The failure by Congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future sales. If a prolonged government shutdown were to occur, it could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the U.S. government\u2019s ability to make timely payments, and our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts.\nIn addition, a decrease in the DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, U.S. government agency budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the presidential election or otherwise, the U.S. government\u2019s budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., allocating more spending to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic), the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce U.S. government military spending, each of which could cause agency budgets to remain unchanged or to decline. A significant decline in U.S. military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. government.\nThe cancellation or material modification of one or more significant contracts could adversely affect our financial results.\nSales, directly and indirectly, to the U.S. government and its agencies accounted for approximately 96% of our total net sales in 2020. Our contracts typically permit the U.S. government to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination.\nIn addition, termination or suspension of any of our significant commercial contracts could result in the loss of future sales and unreimbursable expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Furthermore, the termination of any such contracts for default could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and ability to obtain new business in the future.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract performance and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and on suppliers to provide raw materials and component parts for our contract performance. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customers terminating their contract with us for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials, difficulties in the supplier qualification process or increases in prices of raw materials could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe use a significant quantity of raw materials that are subject to market fluctuations and government regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. We are often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. We may be unable to establish replacement materials and secure customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.\nThe supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant for many years, has been limited to a domestic independent single source that supplies the majority of the domestic solid propellant industry, and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. The completion of the Space Shuttle Program reduced demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. The abnormal escalation pricing language in our contracts and proposals may not be successful in passing the entire price increase on to the customer or may have a reduced profit margin as a result of any such price increase. Efforts to minimize impacts through contracting levers may not be successful.\nWe are also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the sustained availability, prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts, particularly on multi-year programs. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, electronic components, and constituent chemicals. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to negotiate with our customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to obsolete materials and commodity indices to reduce program impact. The DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the \"Berry Amendment\" which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. Similarly, European laws and regulations that apply to our business have additional strategic material sourcing requirements. Cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote \"price in effect\" at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to our programs.\nAn emerging challenge to the extended supply chain is U.S. government contracting regulations to comply with stringent cyber security regulations that may influence the cost of material and services on U.S. government contracts. Further, a relatively recent MDA requirement to pre-approve supplier background screening processes of personnel that will have access to \"controlled unclassified information\" and separately approve any supplier personnel with dual citizenship has been challenging due to delays at MDA in approving requests which will potentially impact the award of subcontracts while approval is pending. Cyber security requirements will prove to be a continuing challenge as some small key/critical suppliers do not have the capability or infrastructure to support the requirements.\nWe may be impacted by significant changes across our supply chain due to increased tariffs on materials imported directly, or any significant effects tariffs may have on domestic materials indirectly.\nProlonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe release, unplanned ignition, explosion, or improper handling of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business operations involve the handling, production, and disposition of potentially explosive and ignitable energetic materials and other dangerous chemicals, including motors and other materials used in rocket propulsion. The handling, production, transport, and disposition of hazardous materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise\ndisrupt our manufacturing operations and could cause production delays. A release of these chemicals or an unplanned ignition or explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and others. Material property damage to us and third parties could also occur. The use of these products in applications by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion, unplanned ignition or fire were to occur. Extensive regulations apply to the handling of explosive and energetic materials, including but not limited to, regulations governing hazardous substances and hazardous waste. The failure to properly store and ultimately dispose of such materials could create significant liability and/or result in regulatory sanctions. Any release, unplanned ignition or explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages or cause production delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe real estate market involves significant risk, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur real estate activities involve significant risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to various risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary re-zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects;\n\u2022we may be unable to complete environmental remediation or to have state and federal environmental restrictions on our property lifted, which could cause a delay or abandonment of these projects;\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain sufficient water sources to service our projects, which may prevent us from executing our plans;\n\u2022our real estate activities may require significant expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with our plans;\n\u2022economic and political uncertainties could have an adverse effect on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general;\n\u2022our property is subject to federal, state, and local regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations on our plans;\n\u2022much of our property is raw land that includes the natural habitats of various endangered or protected wildlife species requiring mitigation;\n\u2022if our land use plans are approved by the appropriate governmental authorities, we may face lawsuits from those who oppose such plans (such lawsuits and the costs associated with such opposition could be material and have an adverse effect on our ability to sell property or realize income from our projects); and\n\u2022the time frame required for approval of our plans means that we will have to wait years for a significant cash return.\nOur results of operations and financial position may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting economic disruption.\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Subsequently, all the states and local governments in communities where we operate issued various state of emergency decrees or \"Stay at Home\" orders restricting non-essential business activities. As a defense industrial-base U.S. government contractor, we are considered an essential business by the U.S. and state governments and we continue to operate as such during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some U.S., state, and local government restrictions have been lifted and eased, resulting in an increase in cases of COVID-19 throughout the U.S., which could in turn increase the risk of future outbreaks or exposure of our workforce to COVID-19 which may impact employee health and absenteeism. There is a risk that new strains of the virus could result in new outbreaks and that the efforts being undertaken to combat the virus may not be as successful or effective as intended. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it therefore remains highly uncertain, as we cannot predict if further governmental restrictions will be issued or if developments will cause a material change in our ability to maintain and operate our business.\nWe continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its future potential impact on our employees, customers, and supply chain. The increase in the number of our employees who are working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased cyber and other security-related risks that are associated with operating in a remote environment. As a result, we have increased reliance on our remote employees following our procedures and protocols to protect our confidential information and information entrusted to us. If our workforce fails to properly adhere to these procedures, we could have increased vulnerability to data loss, security breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar events and intrusions.\nWhile some of our employees are able to work remotely, a significant number can only perform their job functions on site, and we have promulgated policies designed to provide for appropriate social distancing, employee protection, mask-wearing, enhanced cleaning protocols, and health monitoring. We evaluate and modify these policies as needed on an ongoing basis, but there remains the risk of disruption or reduced efficiency caused by social distancing and other protective measures as well as elevated employee absence because of illness or required quarantines.\nWhile our customers and suppliers generally continue to operate and perform their missions, some facilities have temporarily reduced or halted operations due to precautionary measures, staffing illness, or cleaning disruptions. For example, NASA's Stennis Space Center, an engine test site for our space programs, continues to operate at Stage 3 of their coronavirus response framework which limits access to the facility for personnel supporting activities necessary for mission-essential and approved mission-critical work. The length and severity of such delays and closures, and any impact they will have on our\noperations, remains uncertain. We cannot predict whether the current or future closures of our customer facilities related to the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material adverse effect on our financial results and operations. In addition, as we have a diverse supply chain utilizing companies of varying size, resources and complexity, there is no guarantee that our supply network will have sufficient resources or the ability to maintain their operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have caused significant economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. Moreover, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments, companies, and individuals in response to the pandemic may affect our results of operations and financial positions in unexpected ways.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we experience cost overruns on our contracts, we would have to absorb the excess costs which could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to win new contracts.\nIn 2020, approximately 61% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts, most of which are in mature production mode. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a fixed price and realize all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in the costs of performing the contract. As a result, all fixed-price contracts involve the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. To the extent we incur unanticipated cost overruns on a program or platform subject to a fixed-price contract, our profitability would be adversely affected. Future profitability is subject to risks including the ability of suppliers to deliver components of acceptable quality on schedule and the successful implementation of automated tooling in production processes.\nIn 2020, approximately 39% of our net sales were from cost reimbursable contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we agree to be reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee. When our costs are in excess of the final target cost, fees and our margin may be adversely affected. If our costs exceed authorized contract funding or do not qualify as allowable costs under applicable regulations, those costs are expensed, and we will not be reimbursed for those costs. Cost overruns may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.\nAlso, certain costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are generally not allowable, and therefore not recoverable through U.S. government contracts. Unexpected variances in unallowable costs may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or failure to perform by our third party service providers.\nWe are dependent on various critical information technologies, including cyber security functions, administered and supported by third party service providers. The use of third party service providers can cause unexpected security vulnerabilities, loss of control and additional costs in the delivery of information services and data storage. Any disruption of our information technology infrastructure may cause operational stoppages, fines, penalties, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Additionally, we may incur additional costs to comply with our customers', including the U.S. government's, increased cyber security protections and standards in our products.\nSubstantially all of our excess real estate, that we are in the process of entitling for new opportunities, is located in Sacramento County, California, making us vulnerable to changes in economic and other conditions in that particular market.\nAs a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, our long-term real estate performance and the value of our properties will depend upon conditions in the Sacramento region, including:\n\u2022the sustainability and growth of industries located in the Sacramento region;\n\u2022the financial strength and spending of the State of California;\n\u2022local real estate market conditions;\n\u2022changes in neighborhood characteristics;\n\u2022changes in interest rates; and\n\u2022real estate tax rates.\nIf unfavorable economic or other conditions affect the region, our plans and business strategy could be adversely affected.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract and retain key employees.\nOur business has a continuing need to attract large numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding security clearances, to support the growth of the enterprise and to replace individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting, or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. In addition, our inability to appropriately plan for the transfer or replacement of appropriate intellectual capital and skill sets critical to us could result in business disruptions and impair our ability to achieve business objectives.\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 8% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the future, if we are unable to negotiate acceptable new agreements with the unions, upon expiration of the existing contracts, we could experience a strike or work stoppage. Even if we are successful in negotiating new agreements, the new agreements could call for higher wages or benefits paid to union members, which would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our profitability. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on us.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Financing\nWe use estimates when accounting for certain contracts and changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial results.\nOur quarterly and annual sales are affected by a variety of factors that may lead to significant variability in our operating results. In our Aerospace and Defense segment, sales earned under long-term contracts are recognized either on a cost basis, when deliveries are made, or when contractually defined performance milestones are achieved. The timing of deliveries or milestones may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We evaluate the contract value and cost estimates for performance obligations at least quarterly, and more frequently when circumstances change significantly which is described in more detail in Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the status of certain long-term contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur pension plans are currently underfunded and we expect to be required to make cash contributions in future periods, which may reduce the cash available for our businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the pension assets, projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation were $957.0 million, $1,381.5 million, and $424.5 million, respectively. In 2021, we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $94 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. We generally are able to recover contributions related to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts, but there are differences between when we contribute to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under pension funding rules and when it is recoverable under Cost Accounting Standards (\"CAS\"). Accordingly, in 2021, we expect to recover approximately $43 million of our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan contributions as allowable costs on our U.S. government contracts.\nThe funded status of our pension plans may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plans' assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plans' assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plans could be higher than we expect.\nAdditionally, the level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, increases in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporations premiums, changes in regulations, changes in mortality rate assumptions, and other factors affect our financial results. The timing of recognition of retirement benefits expense or income in our financial statements differs from the timing of the required funding under the Pension Protection Act or the amount of funding that can be recorded in our overhead rates through our U.S. government contracting business. Significant cash contributions in future periods could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nIf our operating subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow or if they are not able to pay dividends or otherwise distribute their cash to us, or if we have insufficient funds on hand, we may not be able to service our debt.\nAll of the operations of our Aerospace and Defense and Real Estate segments are conducted through subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations will be largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these subsidiaries to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend upon their operating results and cash flows and will be subject to applicable laws and any contractual restrictions contained in the agreements governing their debt, if any.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. Our ability to operate is limited by the agreements governing our debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had $654.1 million of debt principal. Subject to the limits contained in some of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, we may incur additional debt in the future. Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur level of debt places significant demands on our cash resources, which could:\n\u2022make it more difficult to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash for payments related to our debt, reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, entitlement of our real estate assets, contributions to our tax-qualified pension plan, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022limit our ability to expand our operations through acquisitions; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and fund our operating costs, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants outlined in our debt indentures and agreements that could restrict our operating activities. A failure to comply could result in a default which would, if not waived by the lenders, likely come with substantial cost and accelerate the payment of our debt.\nOur debt instruments generally contain various restrictive covenants which include, among others, provisions which may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022access the full amount of our revolving credit facility and/or incur additional debt;\n\u2022enter into certain leases;\n\u2022make certain distributions, investments, and other restricted payments;\n\u2022cause our restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create certain liens;\n\u2022purchase assets or businesses;\n\u2022sell assets and, if sold, retain excess cash flow from these sales; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur secured debt also contains other customary covenants, including, among others, provisions restricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens. In addition, certain covenants in our bank facility require that we maintain certain financial ratios.\nBased on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2020. Any of the covenants described in this risk factor may restrict our operations and our ability to pursue potentially advantageous business opportunities. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our amended and restated senior credit facility entered into on September 20, 2018, (the \"Senior Credit Facility\") with the lenders identified therein and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the 2\u00bc% Notes. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause cross defaults on the 2\u00bc% Notes.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is determined.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. After 2021, it is unclear whether banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, and no consensus currently exists as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. In the U.S., efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") that has been convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We cannot currently predict the effect of the discontinuation of, or other changes to, LIBOR or any establishment of alternative reference rates in the U.S., the European Union or elsewhere on the global capital markets. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to any alternative reference rate or rates, could have adverse impacts on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. Borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility, which consists of a revolver and term loan, constitute our most significant exposure to this transition and there is no guarantee that a shift from LIBOR to a new reference rate will not result in increases to our borrowing costs.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nOur success and growth depends on our ability to execute long-standing programs and periodically secure new contracts in a competitive environment.\nOur sales are primarily derived from long-standing contracts (often sole source) where we are the long-term incumbent. The challenge is to successfully utilize our technical, engineering, manufacturing, and management skills to execute these programs for the customer, to continue to innovate and refine our solutions, and to offer the customer increasing affordability in an era of fiscal restraint. If we are unable to successfully execute these long-standing programs, our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers may be impaired.\nIn addition, we continue to be subject to intense competition in certain sectors. For example, we face increasing competition from emerging spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have developed liquid fuel propulsion capabilities which are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles. For the in-space\npropulsion market, we also see a number of new startups entering the market in both small chemical propulsion and small electric propulsion systems targeted at the rapidly expanding small satellite market. The U.S. government also has its own manufacturing capabilities in some areas. We may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors and our inability to do so could result in a decrease in sales, profits, and cash flows that we historically have generated from certain contracts. Further, the U.S. government may open to competition programs on which we are currently the sole supplier, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe may expand our operations through acquisitions, which may divert management\u2019s attention and expose us to unanticipated liabilities and costs. Also, acquisitions may increase our non-reimbursable costs. We may experience difficulties integrating any acquired operations, and we may incur costs relating to acquisitions that are never consummated.\nOur business strategy may lead us to expand our Aerospace and Defense segment through acquisitions. However, our ability to consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by U.S. government regulations, the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources, and our ability to obtain financing. Our success in integrating newly acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel, avoid diversion of management\u2019s attention from operational matters, implement internal controls, integrate general and administrative services and key information processing systems and, where necessary, re-qualify our customer programs. In addition, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs, and/or contingent liabilities. We may also incur costs and divert management attention to acquisitions that are never consummated. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated.\nThere may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to, or were unable to, discover during our due diligence investigation of each business that we have acquired or may acquire and for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible. Our efforts to minimize the impact of these types of potential liabilities through indemnities and warranties from sellers in connection with acquisitions may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope, amount or duration, financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor, or other reasons.\nDue to the pending Merger, we do not expect to pursue additional strategic acquisitions at this time. If the Merger were not completed for any reason, we would expect to consider exploring possible strategic acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Legislation, Regulation, and Compliance\nOur Aerospace and Defense segment is subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations inherent in contracting with the U.S. government, and non-compliance could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn the performance of contracts with the U.S. government, we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the DCAA. These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting system. Any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. If such actions were to result in suspension or debarment, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThese laws and regulations provide for ongoing audits and reviews of incurred costs as well as contract procurement, performance and administration. The U.S. government may, if it deems appropriate, conduct an investigation into possible illegal or unethical activity in connection with these contracts. Investigations of this nature are common in the aerospace and defense industry, and lawsuits may result. In addition, the U.S. government and its principal prime contractors periodically investigate the financial viability of their contractors and subcontractors as part of its risk assessment process associated with the award of new contracts. If the U.S. government or one or more prime contractors were to determine that we were not financially viable, our ability to continue to act as a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor would be impaired.\nCyber security incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe routinely defend against various cyber and other security threats against our defenses to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology infrastructure, supply chain, business or customer information and other threats. We are also subject to similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement.\nThe threats we face range from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, insider threats and other threat vectors targeting us and other defense and aerospace companies; because we protect national security information. In addition, cyber threats are evolving, growing in their frequency and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners), and corruption\nof data, networks or systems. We also could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 systems that are used in connection with our business.\nIf we are unable to protect sensitive information or the integrity of our systems, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. There can be no assurance that the variety of efforts, procedures and controls we deploy to monitor and minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cyber security incidents will be sufficient. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to our customers, our future financial results, or our reputation. Such events could also result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts or other intellectual property, early obsolescence of our products and services, or contractual penalties. Moreover, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber security protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses.\nWe may experience warranty claims for product failures, schedule delays or other problems with existing or new products and systems.\nMany of the products we develop and manufacture are technologically advanced systems that must function under demanding operating conditions. The sophisticated and rigorous design, manufacturing and testing processes and practices we employ do not entirely prevent the risk that we may not be able to successfully launch or manufacture our products on schedule or that our products may not perform as intended.\nWhen our products fail to perform adequately, some of our contracts require us to forfeit a portion of our expected profit, receive reduced payments, provide a replacement product or service or reduce the price of subsequent sales to the same customer. Performance penalties may also be imposed when we fail to meet delivery schedules or other measures of contract performance. We do not generally insure against potential costs resulting from any required remedial actions or costs or loss of sales due to postponement or cancellation of scheduled operations or product deliveries.\nOur operations and properties are currently the subject of significant environmental liabilities, and the numerous environmental and other government requirements to which we are subject may become more stringent in the future.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that, among other things, require us to obtain permits to operate and install pollution control equipment and regulate the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. These requirements may become more stringent in the future. Additional regulations dictate how and to what level we remediate contaminated soils and the level to which we are required to clean contaminated groundwater. These requirements may also become more stringent in the future. We may also be subject to fines and penalties relating to the operation of our existing and formerly owned businesses. We have been and are subject to toxic tort and asbestos lawsuits as well as other third-party lawsuits, due to either our past or present use of hazardous substances or the alleged on-site or off-site contamination of the environment through past or present operations. We may incur material costs in defending these claims and lawsuits and any similar claims and lawsuits that may arise in the future. Contamination at our current and former properties is subject to investigation and remediation requirements under federal, state and local laws and regulations, and the full extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Any adverse judgment or cash outlay could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nGiven the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our established reserves may not be sufficient, which could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate range of our estimated future environmental obligations was $300.6 million to $451.1 million and the accrued amount was $300.6 million. In many cases the nature and extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. The reserves are based only on known sites and the known contamination at those sites. It is possible that additional sites needing remediation may be identified or that unknown contamination at previously identified sites may be discovered. It is also possible that the regulatory agencies may change clean-up standards for chemicals of concern such as ammonium perchlorate and trichloroethylene. This could lead to additional expenditures for environmental remediation in the future and, given the uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient.\nMost of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowed to be included in our U.S. government contracts. We currently estimate approximately 12% of our Aerospace and Defense segment environmental costs will not likely be reimbursable.\nOur environmental expenses related to non-Aerojet Rocketdyne sites are generally not recoverable and a significant increase in these estimated environmental expenses could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nA significant portion of our business relates to developing and manufacturing propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems, and munitions applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. The amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and\nuncertainties of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (\"Court of Chancery\") will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or employee of the Company to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine as that doctrine exists under the law of the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThis exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), except that it may apply to such suits if brought derivatively on our behalf. There is, however, uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision in connection with suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act if brought derivatively on our behalf, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nBusiness disruptions could seriously affect us.\nOur business may be affected by disruptions including, but not limited to: threats to physical security of our facilities and employees; information technology attacks; natural disasters; political and social unrest; and pandemics or other public health crises. The costs related to these events may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. For example, subsequent to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s 2020 year-end, a manufacturing building under construction experienced weather damage and we are currently evaluating the impact of such damage. Disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nTax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability\nOur effective tax rate for 2020 was 23.6% compared with 26.5% for 2019. Changes in applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our tax expense, operating results, and/or cash flows.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize such costs incurred in the U.S. over five years. While it is possible that Congress may modify, defer or repeal this provision before it takes effect, we have no assurance that the provision will be modified, deferred or repealed. If this provision is not modified, deferred or repealed, it may have an adverse effect on our cash taxes and as a result, our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affect our financial results.\nOur earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee retirement benefit plans. We calculate the expense for the plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions that we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key assumptions used to estimate retirement benefits expense for the following year are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets. Our pension expense or income can also be affected by legislation and other government regulatory actions.\nOur inability to protect our trade secrets, patents and proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses\u2019 prospects and competitive positions.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain protections for proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary rights protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. In addition, we may incur significant expense in protecting our intellectual property.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may be breached and remedies for a breach may not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred. Other parties may independently develop our know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology.", "PERMNO": 20765, "SIC": 3760, "TIC": "AJRD"}
