{"cik": "1735707", "company": "Garrett Motion Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. A substantial portion of our customers are OEMs in the automotive industry. This industry is subject to rapid technological change often driven by regulatory changes, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns. In addition to general economic conditions, automotive sales and automotive vehicle production also depend on other factors, such as supplier stability, factory transitions, capacity constraints, the costs and availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer preferences. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products. Economic declines and corresponding reductions in automotive sales and production by our customers, particularly with respect to light vehicles, have in the past had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if overall automotive sales and production remain stable, changes in regulations and consumer preferences may shift consumer demand away from the types of vehicles we prioritize or towards the types of vehicles where our products generate smaller profit margins. A decrease in consumer demand for the specific types of vehicles that have traditionally included our turbocharger products, such as a decrease in demand for diesel-fueled vehicles in favor of gasoline-fueled vehicles, or lower-than-expected consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we anticipate providing significant components as part of our strategic growth plan, such as a decrease in demand for vehicles utilizing electric-hybrid and fuel cell powertrains in favor of full battery electric vehicles, could have a significant effect on our business. If we are unable to anticipate significant changes in consumer sentiment, or if consumer demand for certain vehicle types changes more than we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSales in our aftermarket operations are also directly related to consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products, which may be affected by additional factors such as the average useful life of OEM parts and components, severity of regional weather conditions, highway and roadway infrastructure deterioration and the average number of miles vehicles are driven by owners. Improvements in technology and product quality are extending the longevity of vehicle component parts, which may result in delayed or reduced aftermarket sales. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to changes in the demand for our aftermarket products.\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nThe sales and margins of our business are directly impacted by government regulations, including safety, performance and product certification regulations, particularly with respect to emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. While such requirements can promote increased demand for our turbochargers and other products, several markets in which we operate are undertaking efforts to more strictly regulate or ban vehicles powered by certain older-generation diesel engines. If such efforts are pursued more broadly throughout the market than we have anticipated, such efforts may impact demand for our aftermarket products and consequently affect our results of operations.\nIn the long-term, several of the markets in which we operate are contemplating or undertaking multi-decade efforts to transition away from internal combustion engines in favor of hybrid or full-battery electric vehicles.\nAlthough we expect a significant number of hybrids will be turbocharged, if we overestimate the turbo penetration rate in hybrids or if a transition to battery-electric vehicles is pursued more broadly throughout the market, or is implemented more rapidly than we have anticipated, the demand for our products could be impacted and our results of operations consequently could be affected.\nConversely, in the U.S., the current political administration has signaled that it may support efforts to slow or even reverse the adoption of environmental regulations. If requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions are weakened or rolled back, whether in the U.S. or elsewhere in our markets, customer demand for our turbochargers could fall, negatively affecting our results of operations.\nOur future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products with acceptable margins that achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate regulatory changes.\nThe global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors; (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost effectively; and (v) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers\u2019 needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.\nWe have identified a trend towards increased development and adoption by OEMs of hybrid-electric powertrains, fuel cell powertrains and associated electric boosting technologies in preference to pure battery electric cars, which continue to face range, charging time and sustainability issues. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our estimates regarding adoption and penetration rates for hybrid-electric and fuel cell powertrains or for pure battery electric cars are incorrect.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property of others could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available, or we may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate registered or unregistered intellectual property, in every country in which we do business. Accordingly, our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of some business opportunities.\nThe protection of our intellectual property may require us to spend significant amounts of money. Further, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent others from infringing, violating or misappropriating our intellectual proprietary rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as we adopt new technology, we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights. Successful claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, or cause us to incur substantial monetary liability. We may also be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or be required to change our business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. In addition, our customer agreements may require us to indemnify the customer for infringement. The time and expense of defending against these claims, whether meritorious or not, may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability, can be time-consuming and costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Furthermore, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our existing customer relationships and our ability to develop new business.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims, including product recalls, and product liability actions that may be brought against us.\nDepending on the terms under which we supply products to an auto manufacturer, we may be required to guarantee or offer warranties for our products and to bear the costs of recalls, repair or replacement of such products pursuant to new vehicle warranties. There can be no assurance that we will have adequate reserves to cover such recall, repair and replacement costs. In the event that any of our products fails to perform as expected, we may face direct exposure to warranty and product liability claims or may be required to participate in a government or self-imposed recall involving such products. Our customers that are not end users, such as auto manufacturers, may face similar claims or be obliged to conduct recalls of their own, and in such circumstances, they may seek contribution from us. Our agreements with our customers typically do not contain limitation of liability clauses, so if any such claims or contribution requests exceed our available insurance, or if there is a product recall, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have a further adverse impact on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.\nThe operational constraints and financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third-party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver products, parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders on similar terms or at all, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. See \u201c-Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\u201d If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness and operational reliability of existing or future suppliers, if there is any unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and operational reliability, or if our suppliers do not perform or adhere to our existing or future contractual arrangements, any resulting increase in nonperformance by them, our inability to otherwise obtain the supplies or our inability to enforce the terms of the contract or seek other remedies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWork stoppages, other disruptions, or the need to relocate any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our business.\nOur geographic footprint emphasizes locating research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers, thereby enabling us to adopt technologies and products for the specific vehicle types sold in each geographic market. Because our facilities offer localized services in this manner, a work stoppage or other disruption at one or more of our R&D, engineering or manufacturing and assembly facilities in a given region could have material adverse effects on our business, especially insofar as it impacts our ability to serve customers in that region. Moreover, due to unforeseen circumstances or factors beyond our control, we may be forced to relocate our operations from one or more of our existing facilities to new facilities and may incur substantial costs, experience program delays and sacrifice proximity to customers and geographic markets as a result, potentially for an extended period of time.\nThe automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, and when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations, we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the \u201croot cause\u201d problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. We typically must also carry the costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight. Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. These losses and expenses could be significant, and may include consequential losses such as lost profits.\nIn addition, a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or other disruption at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could impact our ability to make timely deliveries to our customers and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time, or as a result of a work stoppage or other disruption, it is unlikely we will be fully compensated, if at all.\nWe may not realize sales represented by awarded business or effectively utilize our manufacturing capacity.\nWhen we win a bid to offer products and services to an OEM customer, the customer typically does not commit to award us its business until a separate contract has been negotiated, generally with a term ranging from one year to the life of the model (usually three to seven years). Once business has been awarded, the OEM customer typically retains the ability to terminate the arrangement without penalty and does not commit to purchase a minimum volume of products while the contract is in effect.\nIn light of the foregoing, while we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions, including projected future sales volumes, the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers\u2019 products; our customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory; design changes; changes in our customers\u2019 manufacturing strategy; the success of customers\u2019 goods and models; and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers. A significant decrease in demand for certain key models or a group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or the ability of a manufacturer to re-source and discontinue purchasing from us its requirements for a particular model or group of models, could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, we may be unable to forecast the level of customer orders with sufficient certainty to allow us to optimize production schedules and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. Any excess capacity would cause us to incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during economic downturns. Similarly, a significant failure or inability to adapt to increased production or desired inventory levels (including as a result of accelerated launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms), comply with customer specifications and manufacturing requirements more generally or respond to other unexpected fluctuations, as well as any delays or other problems with existing or new products (including program launch difficulties) could result in financial penalties, increased costs, loss of sales, loss of customers or potential breaches of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nIf actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business, or if we are unable to improve utilization levels for manufacturing lines that consequently are underutilized and correctly manage capacity, the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate.\nWe may not be able to successfully negotiate pricing terms with our customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe negotiate sales prices annually with our automotive customers. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the period of production. In addition, our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts at any time, which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions. OEMs have also exercised significant influence over their suppliers, including us, because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive and serves a limited number of customers. Based on these factors, our status as a Tier I supplier (one that supplies vehicle components directly to manufacturers) and the fact that our customers\u2019 product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes, our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing, and any cost-cutting initiatives that our customers adopt generally will result in increased downward pressure on our pricing. Any resulting impacts to our sales levels and margins, or the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors, could over time significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. In particular, large commercial settlements with our customers may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.\nWe have created a geographic footprint that emphasizes locating R&D, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers. Our international geographic footprint subjects us to many risks, including: exchange control regulations; wage and price controls; antitrust and environmental regulations; employment regulations; foreign investment laws; monetary and fiscal policies and protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, establish local content requirements, or impact trade volumes; import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes); violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws; changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises; nationalization of private enterprises; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses; global health risks and pandemics; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions; violence, civil and labor unrest; acts of terrorism; and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Additionally, certain of the markets in which we operate have adopted increasingly strict data privacy and data protection requirements or may require local storage and processing of data or similar requirements. The European Commission has approved a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), that came into force in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The GDPR and similar data protection measures may increase the cost and complexity of our ability to deliver our services.\nAs negotiations relating to the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union proceed, our manufacturing operations in Cheadle and the businesses of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted if tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on the free flow of goods to and from the U.K. Similarly, President Donald Trump\u2019s decisions in March 2018 to impose both an ad valorem tariff on steel products imported into the United States and a separate set of tariffs on certain Chinese imports, and the resulting discussions about potential retaliatory tariffs from the E.U., China and other countries, could result in the creation of further barriers to trade. Such barriers could adversely affect the businesses of our customers and suppliers, which could in turn negatively impact our sales and results of operations. These and other instabilities and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, along with the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\nAs a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar whereas a significant amount of our payment obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange risk. We monitor and seek to reduce such risk through hedging activities; however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility.\nFinally, we generate significant amounts of cash that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose us to financial loss.\nWe have invested substantial resources in specific foreign markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized.\nWe have identified certain countries, such as China and India, as key high-growth geographic markets. We believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long-term growth, and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in numerous manufacturing operations, technical centers, R&D activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas. If market demand for evolving vehicle technologies in these regions does not grow as quickly as we anticipate, or if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions, we may fail to realize expected rates of return, or even incur losses, on our existing investments and may be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories, potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors. In particular, our ability to remain competitive and continue to grow in these regions depends in part on the absence of competing state-sponsored domestic businesses. If a state-sponsored operation entered a local market as a competitor, it might have access to significant social and financial capital that would enable it to overcome the ordinary barriers to entry in the turbocharger industry and acquire potentially significant market share at our expense.\nWe could be adversely affected by our leading market position in certain markets.\nWe believe that we are a market leader in the turbocharger industry in many of the markets in which we operate. Although we believe we have acted properly in the markets in which we have significant market share, we could face allegations of abuse of our market position or of collusion with other market participants, which could result in negative publicity and adverse regulatory action by the relevant authorities, including the imposition of monetary fines, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional capital that we need in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations, satisfy indemnity obligations to Honeywell, and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and R&D projects and the status and timing of these developments. If our access to capital were to become constrained significantly, or if costs of capital increased significantly, due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the solvency of our customers, a material decline in demand for or our products, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain targeted credit ratings.\nMoreover, we have historically relied on Honeywell for assistance in satisfying our capital requirements. As a result of the Spin-Off, we are no longer able to rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of Honeywell, and Honeywell will not provide funds to finance our capital requirements. We are also responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements independent of Honeywell, and debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. Incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, our agreements and obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement that address compliance with Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) may limit our ability to issue stock. We may need additional capital resources in the future in order to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Spin-Off - We may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate effectively as an independent, publicly traded company, and we may experience increased costs due to our separation from Honeywell.\u201d\nWe are subject to risks associated with the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we are required to make substantial cash payments to Honeywell, measured in substantial part by reference to estimates by Honeywell of certain of its liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into an Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, pursuant to which we have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of Honeywell\u2019s asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, primarily related to Honeywell\u2019s legacy Bendix friction materials (\u201cBendix\u201d) business in the United States as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, in each case related to legacy elements of our business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less 90% of Honeywell\u2019s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities.\nThe amount payable by the Company in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year will be payable in Euros, subject to a cap (denominated in Euros) equal to $175 million, calculated by reference to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate. The cap is exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum.\nFor example, if in any given year, Honeywell\u2019s annual liabilities including associated legal costs that are within the scope of the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement totaled $200 million, and if Honeywell\u2019s associated insurance receipts and other specified recoveries totaled $20 million (resulting in a net amount of $180 million), then our payment obligation in respect of that year would be based upon 90% of the net amount ($162 million), payable in Euros, calculated by reference to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate (1.16977 USD = 1 EUR) (totaling\napproximately \u20ac138.5 million). However, if in any given year, such liabilities including associated legal costs totaled $250 million, and the associated insurance receipts and other specified recoveries totaled $30 million, then our payment obligation in respect of that year would be capped at approximately \u20ac149.6 million (which equals $175 million divided by the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate of 1.16977 USD = 1 EUR) even though 90% of the net amount is higher at $198 million (\u20ac169.3 million calculated by reference to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate of 1.16977 USD = 1 EUR).\nThe Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement provides that the agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (x) December 31, 2048 or (y) December 31st of the third consecutive year during which certain amounts owed to Honeywell during each such year were less than $25 million as converted into Euros in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\nFollowing the Spin-Off in 2018, the Company paid Honeywell $41 million in connection with the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement. Prior to the Spin-Off, Honeywell\u2019s asbestos-related Bendix liability payments for the years 2017 and 2016 including any legal fees, were $223 million and $201 million, respectively, and Honeywell\u2019s associated insurance receipts for 2017 and 2016 were $20 million and $37 million, respectively.\nIn the event that Honeywell enters into a global settlement of all or substantially all of the asbestos-related Bendix claims in the United States, the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement provides that we are obligated to pay 90% of the amount paid or payable by Honeywell in connection with such global settlement payment, less 90% of insurance receipts relating to such liabilities, and in such event, we are required to pay an amount equal to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate equivalent of $175 million per year until the amount payable by us in respect of such global settlement payment is less than an amount equal to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate equivalent of $175 million. During that time, the annual payment by us to Honeywell of an amount equal to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate equivalent of $175 million will be first allocated towards asbestos-related liabilities arising outside of the scope of the global settlement and environmental-related liabilities and then towards the global settlement payment. Payment amounts will be deferred to the extent that the payment thereof would cause a specified event of default under certain indebtedness, including our principal credit agreement or cause us to not be compliant with certain financial covenants in certain indebtedness, including our principal credit agreement on a pro forma basis, including the maximum total leverage ratio (ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement, which excludes any amounts owed to Honeywell under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement), and the minimum interest coverage ratio. In each calendar quarter, our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock in such calendar quarter will be restricted until any amounts payable under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement in such quarter (including any deferred payment amounts) are paid to Honeywell and we will be required to use available restricted payment capacity under our debt agreements to make payments in respect of any such deferred amounts. Payment of deferred amounts and certain other amounts (which are not expected to be material) could cause the amount we are required to pay under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement in any given year to exceed an amount equal to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate equivalent of $175 million per year (exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum). All amounts payable under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that act as guarantors under our principal credit agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, we are also subject to certain of the affirmative and negative covenants to which we are subject under our principal credit agreement. Further, pursuant to the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, our ability to (i) amend or replace our principal credit agreement, (ii) enter into another credit agreement and make amendments or waivers thereto, or (iii) enter into or amend or waive any provisions under other agreements, in each case, in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of Honeywell under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, will be subject to Honeywell\u2019s prior written consent. This consent right will significantly limit our ability to engage in many types of significant transactions on favorable terms (or at all), including, but not limited to, equity and debt financings, liability management transactions, refinancing transactions, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions.\nThis agreement may have material adverse effects on our liquidity and cash flows and on our results of operations, regardless of whether we experience a decline in net sales. The agreement may also require us to accrue significant long-term liabilities on our consolidated and combined balance sheet, the amounts of which will be dependent on factors outside of our control, including Honeywell\u2019s responsibility to manage and determine the outcomes of claims underlying the liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we have accrued $1,244 million of liability in connection with Bendix-related asbestos as well as environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, representing the estimated liability for pending claims as well as future claims expected to be asserted. The liabilities related to the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement may have a significant negative impact on the calculation of key financial ratios and other metrics that are important to investors, rating agencies and securities analysts in evaluating our creditworthiness and the value of our securities. Accordingly, our access to capital to fund our operations may be materially adversely affected and the value of your investment in our company may decline. Moreover, the payments that we are required to make to Honeywell pursuant to the terms of that agreement will not be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAlthough we have access to certain information regarding these liabilities as we may reasonably request for certain purposes, as well as the ability to participate in periodic standing meetings with Honeywell\u2019s special counsel responsible for management of the underlying claims, the payment obligations under this agreement relate to legal proceedings that we will not control, and we accordingly do not expect to be able to make definitive decisions regarding settlements or other outcomes that could influence our potential related exposure.\nThe Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement also includes other obligations that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests.\nRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials (including, but not limited to, grey iron, aluminum, stainless steel and a nickel, iron and chromium-based alloy) is a key element in the cost of our products. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single- or sole-source basis. Although we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Short- or long-term capacity constraints or financial distress at any point in our supply chain could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial performance, particularly when the affected suppliers and vendors are the sole sources of products that we require or that have unique capabilities, or when our customers have directed us to use those specific suppliers and vendors. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial contracts, and could result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.\nFailure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business.\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, workforce reductions, asset impairments, product line rationalizations and other cost-saving initiatives. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the investigation and cleanup of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may arise from hazardous substance releases and exposures. We are also subject to potentially material liabilities related to the compliance of our operations with the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign governments that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. If we are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to substantial fines and criminal sanctions, and be required to install costly equipment or make operational changes to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations or government enforcement of policies concerning the environment, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new information related to individual contaminated sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur additional currently unanticipated costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of our current and historical business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, product liability (including legacy asbestos claims involving the friction materials legacy business), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If we were required to make payments, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the complex nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel, scientists and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem or service failures, including as a result of cyber or other security incidents, could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nPursuant to our Transition Services Agreement with Honeywell, we continue to rely on Honeywell\u2019s information technology and engineering systems. In addition, we deploy and maintain our own IT and engineering systems. Our and Honeywell\u2019s systems involve sensitive information and may be conducted in hazardous environments. As a result, we are subject to systems or service failures, not only resulting from our own or Honeywell\u2019s failures or the failures of third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, but also from exposure to cyber or other security threats. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats,\ndirected at the Company, Honeywell, our or Honeywell\u2019s products, our or Honeywell\u2019s customers and/or our or Honeywell\u2019s third-party service providers, including cloud providers. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber and other security threats we face, and our customers are increasingly requiring cyber and other security protections and mandating cyber and other security standards in our products.\nCyber and other security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Moreover, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other intentional or inadvertent non-compliance with our security protocols may result in a breach of our information systems. Cyber and other security incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products.\nThe potential consequences of a material cyber or other security incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the United States Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cyber and other security protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action, these incidents could generate increased costs or loss of revenue if our customers choose to postpone or cancel previously scheduled orders or decide not to renew any of our existing contracts.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The successful assertion of a large claim against us with respect to a cyber or other security incident could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs, may be a distraction to our management and harm our customer relationships, as well as our reputation.\nOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of our future earnings which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. The Tax Act includes changes to the taxation of foreign earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system, expansion of the current anti-deferral rules, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion. The Tax Act also includes a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, expensing of capital investment, and limitation of the deduction for interest expense. Furthermore, as part of the transition to the new tax system, a one-time transition tax was imposed on a U.S. shareholder\u2019s historical undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates. Although the Tax Act was generally effective January 1, 2018, GAAP requires recognition of the tax effects of new legislation during the reporting period that includes the enactment date, which was December 22, 2017.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, we are required to make payments to a subsidiary of Honeywell in an amount payable in Euros (calculated by reference to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate) representing the net tax liability of Honeywell under the mandatory transition tax attributable to us, as determined by Honeywell. Following the Spin-Off, Honeywell has determined the portion of its net tax liability attributable to us is $240 million. The amount will be payable in installments over 8 years and may be adjusted at Honeywell\u2019s discretion in the event of an audit adjustment or otherwise. In connection with the Tax Matters Agreement, we paid Honeywell the Euro-equivalent of $19 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. Furthermore, Honeywell will control any subsequent tax audits or legal proceedings with respect to the mandatory transition tax, and accordingly we do not expect to be able to make definitive decisions regarding settlements or other outcomes that could influence our potential related exposure.\nBecause we have officers and directors who live outside of the United States, you may have no effective recourse against them for misconduct and may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of your investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers.\nWe have officers and directors who live outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the U.S. any judgments obtained against those officers and directors, or obtain judgments against them outside of the U.S. that are based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the U.S. Investors may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of their investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers.\nOur emerging opportunities in technology, products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nA number of our emerging opportunities in technology, products and services rely on key technologies developed or licensed from third parties. While none of our current product offerings are covered by third-party licenses, many of our emerging technology offerings that we are developing use software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including both through proprietary and open source licenses. Should such emerging products become a significant part of our product offerings, our reliance on third-party licenses may present various risks to our business. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our emerging technology offerings, our relationship with these third parties may deteriorate, or our agreements with these third parties may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available for use in the future on terms that may be acceptable or that allow our emerging product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our emerging technology offerings. Moreover, it is possible that as a consequence of a future merger or acquisition we may be involved in, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to obtain these rights.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off and our Separation from Honeywell\nIf the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could have an indemnification obligation to Honeywell, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf, as a result of any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, we could be required to indemnify Honeywell for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Further, if any pre-spin restructuring activities that were initiated by Honeywell were determined to be taxable and benefit the Company, we could be required to indemnify Honeywell. Those amounts could be material. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that resulted in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Distribution, the Spin-Off would generally be taxable to Honeywell, but not to stockholders, under Section 355(e), unless it were established that such transactions and the Spin-Off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions. If the Spin-Off were taxable to Honeywell due to such a 50% or greater change in ownership of our stock, Honeywell would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value on the Distribution Date of our common stock distributed to Honeywell stockholders over Honeywell\u2019s tax basis in our common stock, and we generally would be required to indemnify Honeywell for the tax on such gain and related expenses. Those amounts would be material. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe have agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 of the Code and are intended to preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. These covenants include certain restrictions on our activity for a period of two years following the Spin-Off, unless Honeywell gives its consent for us to take a restricted action, which Honeywell is permitted to grant or withhold at its sole discretion. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we will be able to, among other things, design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are better targeted to our business\u2019s areas of strength and differentiation, better focus our financial and operational resources on those specific strategies, create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance, provide investors more flexibility and enable us to achieve alignment with a more natural stockholder base and implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all, for a variety of reasons, including: (i) operating as a stand-alone public company following the Spin-Off will require significant amounts of our management\u2019s time and effort, which may divert management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our business; (ii) we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of Honeywell; and (iii) our businesses will be less diversified than Honeywell\u2019s businesses prior to the separation. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate effectively as an independent, publicly traded company, and we may experience increased costs due to our separation from Honeywell.\nWe have historically operated as part of Honeywell\u2019s corporate organization, and Honeywell has provided us with various corporate functions. Due to the separation, Honeywell no longer has an obligation to provide us with assistance other than certain transition and other services. The agreements providing for these services do not include every service that we have received from Honeywell in the past, and Honeywell is only obligated to provide the transition services for limited periods following completion of the Spin-Off. The agreements were entered into on arms-length terms similar to those that would be agreed with an unaffiliated third party such as a buyer in a sale transaction, but because we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Honeywell representing our interests while the agreements were being negotiated, it is possible that we might have been able to achieve more favorable terms if the circumstances differed. We will rely on Honeywell to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under our transition services agreement and other agreements related to the Spin-Off, and if Honeywell does not satisfy such obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nFollowing the cessation of these agreements, we will need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services we will no longer receive from Honeywell. These services include legal, accounting, information technology, software development, human resources and other infrastructure support, the effective and appropriate performance of which are critical to our operations. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Honeywell. Because our business historically operated as part of the wider Honeywell organization, we may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently, or may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business. In particular, our ability to position and market ourselves as a provider of connected vehicle software could be adversely affected by our loss of access to Honeywell\u2019s development platforms. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions, and our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject.\nWe are in the process of installing and implementing information technology infrastructure to support certain of our business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, customer service, inventory control and distribution. We may incur substantially higher costs than currently anticipated as we transition from the existing transactional and operational systems and data centers we currently use as part of Honeywell. If we are unable to transition effectively, we may incur temporary interruptions in business operations. Any delay in implementing, or operational interruptions suffered while implementing, our new information technology infrastructure could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we are unable to replicate or transition certain systems, our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired. As a result of the Spin-Off, we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. Beginning with our second required Annual Report on Form 10-K, we intend to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these, and other public company reporting, requirements. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market-If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\u201d\nWe have a limited operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived much of the financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K from Honeywell\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of Honeywell\u2019s broader corporate organization, and Honeywell performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Honeywell for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent publicly traded company.\n\u2022\nWe have entered into transactions with Honeywell that did not exist prior to the Spin-Off, such as Honeywell\u2019s provision of transition and other services, and undertaken indemnification obligations, which will cause us to incur new costs.\n\u2022\nOur historical consolidated and combined financial information prior to the Spin-Off does not reflect changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of our separation from Honeywell, including changes in the financing, cash management, operations, cost structure and personnel needs of our business. As part of Honeywell, we enjoyed certain benefits from Honeywell\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments, and we have lost these benefits due to the Spin-Off. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, or access capital markets, on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of Honeywell prior to the Spin-Off, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, our historical consolidated and combined financial data prior to the Spin-Off do not include an allocation of interest expense comparable to the interest expense we incurred as a result of the Spin-Off and related reorganization transactions, including interest expense in connection with our incurrence of indebtedness.\nDue to our separation from Honeywell, we also face additional costs and demands on management\u2019s time associated with being an independent, publicly traded company, including costs and demands related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. While we have been profitable as part of Honeywell, we cannot assure you that our profits will continue at a similar level now that we are an independent, publicly traded company.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred substantial indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,660 million, of which $1,628 million of the net proceeds were transferred to Honeywell substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Spin-Off.\nWe historically relied upon Honeywell to fund our working capital requirements and other cash requirements. We are now responsible for servicing our own debt and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. Due to our separation from Honeywell, our access to and cost of debt financing will be different from the historical access to and cost of debt financing under Honeywell. Differences in access to and cost of debt financing may result in differences in the interest rate charged to us on financings, as well as the amount of indebtedness, types of financing structures and debt markets that may be available to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe terms of the indebtedness we incurred in connection with the Spin-Off restricts our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of the indebtedness we incurred in connection with the Spin-Off include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\n\u2022\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nFurthermore, the lenders of this indebtedness have required that we pledge our assets as security for our repayment obligations and that we abide by certain financial or operational covenants. Our ability to comply with such covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of this indebtedness. If an event of default occurred, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt, and the event of default or acceleration could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and lenders could then proceed against any collateral. Any subsequent replacement of the agreements governing such indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. The occurrence and ramifications of an event of default could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, as a result of all of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations.\nThe London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our debt obligations under the term loan B facility of our principal credit agreement may be adversely affected.\nOur customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. Any failure of parties to be satisfied with our financial stability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with Honeywell with respect to our past and ongoing relationships.\nConflicts of interest may arise between Honeywell and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Honeywell;\n\u2022\nintellectual property matters;\n\u2022\nemployee recruiting and retention; and\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving our company.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with a party with whom we were not previously affiliated.\nCertain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in Honeywell.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Honeywell, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in Honeywell. Continuing ownership of Honeywell shares could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and Honeywell face decisions that could have implications for both us and Honeywell.\nThe allocation of intellectual property rights between Honeywell and us as part of the Spin-Off, and our shared use of certain intellectual property rights, could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into agreements with Honeywell governing the allocation of intellectual property rights related to our business. These agreements could adversely affect our position and options relating to intellectual property enforcement, licensing negotiations and monetization. We also may not have sufficient rights to grant sublicenses of intellectual property used in our business. These circumstances could adversely affect our ability to protect our competitive position in the industry.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur stock has only been trading since the Spin-Off, and an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell our shares and could lead to our share price being depressed or volatile.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade or whether the combined market value of a share of our common stock and a share of Honeywell\u2019s common stock will be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of a share of Honeywell common stock prior to the Spin-Off. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\ncompetition and industry capacity;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our common stock after the Spin-Off;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and our industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nLow trading volume for our stock, which may occur if an active trading market is not sustained, among other reasons, would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility.\nShould the market price of our stock drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThere is a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the supporting evidence for our liability to Honeywell under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets reflect a liability of $1,244 million in Obligations payable to Honeywell as of December 31, 2018 (the \u201cIndemnification Liability\u201d). The amount of the Indemnification Liability is based on information provided to us by Honeywell with respect to Honeywell\u2019s assessment of its own asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable as of such date and is calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement. Honeywell estimates its future liability for asbestos-related claims based on a number of factors.\nIn the course of preparing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, our management determined that there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the supporting evidence for our liability to Honeywell under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement. Specifically, we were unable to independently verify the accuracy of the certain information Honeywell provided to us that we used to calculate the amount of our Indemnification Liability, including information provided in Honeywell's actuary report and the amounts of settlement values and insurance receivables. For example, Honeywell did not provide us with sufficient information to make an independent assessment of the probable outcome of the underlying asbestos proceedings and whether certain insurance receivables are recoverable.\nIt is possible that, in future periods, new information may become available relating to the amount of Honeywell\u2019s underlying asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable as of December 31, 2018 that could cause the amount of the Indemnification Liability reported on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to change, possibly materially, which could lead to a restatement of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nIf we are unable to remediate this material weakness or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify future deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, or in the event of any restatement of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, the market price of shares of common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to evaluate whether to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, and the terms of our indebtedness will limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe plan to evaluate whether to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, will fall within the discretion of our board of directors. The Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on consideration of many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, sufficiency of distributable reserves, opportunities to retain future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth, capital requirements, debt service obligations, obligations under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Additionally, the terms of the indebtedness we intend to incur in connection with the Spin-Off and obligations under the Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement each will limit our ability to pay cash dividends. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence paying dividends.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we will be granting to our directors, officers and other employees. We expect that shares of our common stock will be issuable upon the future vesting of certain Honeywell equity awards held by our employees that converted into Garrett equity awards in connection with the Spin-Off. Our Board has adopted and Honeywell, as our sole shareholder, approved, the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan of Garrett and its Affiliates (the \u201cEquity Plan\u201d) for the benefit of certain of our current and future employees and other service providers. Our non-employee directors will be eligible to participate in the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Awards made under such plans will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may generally determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of our board of directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFrom time-to-time, we may opportunistically evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities, including acquisitions for which the consideration thereof may consist partially or entirely of newly-issued shares of our common stock and, therefore, such transactions, if consummated, would dilute the voting power and/or reduce the value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, among others, provisions that:\n\u2022\nprovide for staggered terms for directors on our Board for a period following the Spin-Off;\n\u2022\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, in each case except as such rights may otherwise be provided to holders of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to enter into business combination transactions.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of Garrett, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the courts of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Garrett, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the action may be brought in any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nBeginning with our second required annual report on form 10-K, we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as\nrequired by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, the market price of shares of common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may provide an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. Even if we were to conclude, and our auditors were to concur, that our internal control over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our shares of common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. See \u201c-Risks Relating to the Spin-Off-As we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions, and our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject.\u201d", "PERMNO": 18065, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "GTX"}
