{"cik": "907242", "company": "MONARCH CASINO & RESORT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact our business. You should carefully consider the following discussion of risks, and the other information provided in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us; however, they do represent all material risks currently known to us. Additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOUR BUSINESS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO WEAK DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING\nConsumer demand for entertainment and other amenities at hotel-casino properties and casino properties, such as ours, are particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary consumer spending on leisure activities and corporate spending on conventions and trade shows. We market to and rely upon the patronage of customers from the Reno and Denver metropolitan areas, as well as leisure traveler and conventioneer guests. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences in these, and other geographic markets, brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for bank failures, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to pandemic diseases, such as the coronavius, which could materially and adversely affect travel, CONVENTIONS, HOTEL STAYS AND/OR LOCAL VISITORS, EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN and result in reduced demand for our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the effect of, or the public perception of a risk of, a pandemic disease on the travel, convention and leisure industries. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, financial results, cash flows and liquidity for an extended period of time. We expect the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial results, will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue. We were allowed to open the Atlantis on June 4, 2020, and Monarch Black Hawk Casino on June 17, 2020. We cannot predict whether there will be a subsequent closing order due to pandemic spikes or other reasons or whether additional or changed conditions, or restrictions may occur or continue, nor the effects of any such conditions. Once travel, social distancing and self-quarantine restrictions are modified or cease to be necessary, demand for our properties may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if and when the gaming and non-gaming activities of our properties will return to pre-outbreak levels of volume or pricing. Future demand for properties may be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth or reduced business spending for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and extended shutdowns of certain businesses and cancelations or postponements of public events, including conventions, trade shows and sporting events around the world. The convention business at Atlantis has been affected by state-mandated gathering limits. We have experienced hotel stay and convention booking cancelations, and since the reopening, guest visitation and hotel and convention bookings have been lower than prior to the state-mandated closures, and are expected to remain lower for the near future.\nOur businesses would also be impacted should the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic lead to prolonged changes in consumer behavior. There are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of these matters, such as the fixed costs at our properties. The COVID-19 pandemic also makes it more challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our businesses, particularly over the near to medium term. These events may continue to disrupt our ability to staff our business, could continue to disrupt our operations or construction projects and, if the global response to contain the COVID-19 pandemic escalates or is unsuccessful, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are required to raise capital in the future, our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing would be negatively impacted. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. There is no guarantee that our current debt financings will be enough to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. Our current facility contains restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions and various financial covenants. We cannot assure you that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will not impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants in the future, nor can we assure you that we would be able to obtain waivers or modifications from our lenders in the event of noncompliance in the future.\nWe are entirely dependent on TWO resorts for all of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties\nWe are currently entirely dependent upon our Atlantis Casino Resort and our Monarch Black Hawk for all of our operating cash flow. As a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties or greater geographic diversification. The risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:\n\u25cf changes in local economic and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf labor supply disruptions or shortages;\n\u25cf disruptions in our supply chain;\n\u25cf changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations, and the way in which those laws and regulations are applied;\n\u25cf natural and other disasters, including pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks of infectious or contagious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf continuing actions by government officials at the federal, state and/or local level with respect to steps to be taken in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak, including, without limitation, temporary or extended shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing and shelter-in-place orders;\n\u25cf an increase in the cost of maintaining our properties;\n\u25cf a decline in the number of visitors to Reno or Black Hawk; and\n\u25cf a decrease in gaming and non-casino activities at our resorts.\nAny of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments or maintain our covenants with respect to our debt.\nCERTAIN OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS OWN LARGE INTERESTS IN OUR CAPITAL STOCK AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE OUR AFFAIRS\nJohn Farahi and Bob Farahi, our officers and directors, David Farahi, John Farahi\u2019s son and an officer, together with John\u2019s and Bob\u2019s brother Ben Farahi, beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 34% of our outstanding common stock, inclusive of options held by them which are exercisable within 60 days. As such, members of the Farahi family, if voting together, have the ability to significantly influence our affairs, including the election of the board of directors and, except as otherwise provided by law, approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including a merger, consolidation, or sale of assets.\nTO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, WE WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CASH. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund future capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. On September 3, 2020, we entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and certain banks (the \u201cFourth Amended Credit Facility\u201d), which amended and restated our $250.0 million credit facility, dated as of July 20, 2016 (the \u201cPrior Credit Facility\u201d). On September 29, 2020, we executed an Amendment to the Fourth Amended Credit Facility, which amends the definition of \u201cFinancial Covenant Start Date\u201d. Our failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain future borrowings may impact our ability to repay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. In such cases, we may have to adopt alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. These financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nCOVENANT RESTRICTIONS UNDER OUR FOURTH AMENDED CREDIT FACILITY MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur Fourth Amended Credit Facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, make distributions, make investments, grant liens on our assets to secure debt, enter into transactions with affiliates and effect mergers or acquisitions, as well as covenants that relate to our Monarch Black Hawk Expansion. Although the covenants in our Fourth Amended Credit Facility are subject to various exceptions, we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest. In addition, our long-term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. A breach of any of the covenants in the agreement governing our Fourth Amended Credit Facility could result in a default under such agreement. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control, including difficulties or delay in the completion of our Monarch Black Hawk Expansion. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these covenants. If an event of default under the agreement governing our Fourth Amended Credit Facility occurs, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, our Fourth Amended Credit Facility is secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of our assets. If we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default, the lenders could foreclose on these assets.\nOUR VARIABLE RATE INDEBTEDNESS SUBJECTS US TO INTEREST RATE RISK, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY\nAn increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense arising on our indebtedness. The interest rate under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility is a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.25%, the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 3.25%. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under the Fourth Amended Credit Facility will increase even when the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nUncertainty relating to the likely phasing out of LIBOR may result in our paying increased interest under our credit facilities.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the continuation of LIBOR on its current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. The administrator of LIBOR has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two-month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. Extending the publication of certain USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023 would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before LIBOR experiences disruptions.\nBorrowings under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility bears interest at a rate determined using LIBOR as the reference rate. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance, modification or other reform of LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks, or LIBOR-based debt instruments such as our Fourth Amended Credit Facility. However, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rates payable under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility to be substantially higher than we would otherwise have expected.\nINTENSE COMPETITION EXISTS IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO CONTINUE TO INTENSIFY\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers, employees and management. We compete with numerous casinos and hotel-casinos, with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, with various other entertainment businesses, and with any new forms of gaming, including internet gaming, that has been or may be legalized. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. We compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas in which we operate. In some markets, we also face competition from nearby markets. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television, movies, concerts, and travel.\nAs competitive pressures increase, other casinos may intensify their marketing efforts. Increased competitive pressures in our local markets could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract local residents to the Atlantis and the Monarch Black Hawk or require us to use more expensive, and therefore, less profitable, promotions to compete.\nWith fewer new markets opening for development, competition in existing markets has intensified. We have invested in expanding the Atlantis and renovating and expanding the Monarch Black Hawk. Our competitors have also expanded their facilities and developed new facilities. These expansions, the increases in the number of properties and aggressive marketing strategies of our competitors have increased competition in our markets, and this intense competition can be expected to continue. In addition, competition may intensify if our competitors implement aggressive pricing and promotional activities in order to attract customers.\nIf our competitors operate more successfully than we do, if they attract customers away from us, if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees, if their properties are enhanced or expanded, if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages from differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes, or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around our markets, we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees. In particular, the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also believe that the legalization of additional casino gaming in or near any major metropolitan area in the Atlantis\u2019 or Monarch Black Hawk\u2019s key marketing areas could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there have been proposals for the development of Native American, racetrack and video lottery terminal casinos throughout the state of Colorado over the years, although none of the proposals has been adopted by the state\u2019s electorate or legislature. Twice, the owners of the Arapahoe Race Track, southeast of Denver, have funded state wide ballot initiatives to allow casino style gaming at the race track. Both measures were voted down by wide margins. As of December 31, 2020, none of the proposals have been adopted by the state\u2019s electorate or by the legislature. Should any form of additional gaming be authorized in the Denver metropolitan area, Monarch Black Hawk could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Native American gaming facilities in some instances operate under less stringent regulatory requirements than those imposed on our properties, which could provide them a competitive advantage in our markets. Moreover, we face competition from internet and other account wagering gaming services, which would allow their guests to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. The legalization of internet poker and other forms of internet gaming could create further competition for our operations.\nOUR EXPANSION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT RISKS INHERENT IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS\nOur Monarch Black Hawk expansion and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory, environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects.\nWe have not entered into a guaranteed maximum price (\u201cGMP\u201d) amendment as contemplated in the construction contract with our Monarch Black Hawk general contractor. We have numerous disagreements with our Monarch Black Hawk general contractor, including disagreements over costs, schedule delays, and other construction related matters. Such disagreements have resulted in litigation with our Monarch Black Hawk general contractor, as discussed in this annual report.\nThe disputes with the Monarch Black Hawk Expansion general contractor have resulted in and may continue to result in:\n\u25cf delays in completing the Monarch Black Hawk Expansion and exiting facility renovation;\n\u25cf disputes and claims over the quality and management of the construction;\n\u25cf disputes and claims over payments, construction costs, staffing costs, damages and other financial responsibility; and\n\u25cf disruptions of relationships with the general contractor, subcontractors, vendors and others.\nIn addition, our current and future projects could also experience:\n\u25cf delays and significant cost increases;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;\n\u25cf shortages of materials;\n\u25cf shortages of skilled labor, work stoppages or labor disputes;\n\u25cf poor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance;\n\u25cf unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u25cf weather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses; and\n\u25cf COVID-19 related delays.\nThe completion dates of any of our projects could differ significantly from expectations for construction-related or other reasons.\nIn connection with the expansion of the Monarch Black Hawk and the related disputes described above, our general contractor PCL and certain subcontractors have provided Monarch with purported notice of their intent to file a liens against the Monarch Black Hawk some subcontractors have recorded such liens Any action to enforce such liens against the Monarch Black Hawk may impact our operations on the property and result in us incurring significant expenses relating to defending against such actions.\nIn addition, actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations. Our initial project costs and construction periods are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared at inception of the project in consultation with architects and contractors. Many of these costs can increase over time as the project is built to completion.\nWe may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns. If we cannot pay cost overruns through cash sources or financing on a timely basis, the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate funding is available. We can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on time, if at all, or within established budgets, or that any project will result in increased earnings to us. Significant delays, cost overruns, or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY GOVERNMENT APPROVALS FOR OUR EXPANSION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, OR AT ALL\nWe have not yet obtained certain permits, licenses and approvals necessary for some of our anticipated projects. The scope of the approvals required can be extensive and may include gaming approvals, state and local land-use permits and building and zoning permits. Unexpected changes or concessions required by governmental authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of facilities.\nOUR EXPANSION AND RENOVATION ACTIVITIES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS\nAlthough we plan our expansion and renovation projects to minimize disruption of our existing business operations, these projects require, from time to time, all or portions of affected existing operations to be closed or disrupted. Any significant disruption in operations of a property could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFAILURE OF THE RENO-SPARKS CONVENTION CENTER TO BOOK AND ATTRACT CONVENTION BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AT THE ATLANTIS\nThe Atlantis is the closest hotel-casino to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center and the enclosed pedestrian sky bridge, that connects the Atlantis directly with the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, has afforded us a distinct competitive advantage in attracting its conventioneers, who typically pay higher average room rates than non-conventioneers. However, if the Reno-Sparks Convention Center does not succeed in booking the anticipated level of conventions, we will not, in turn, benefit from the patronage of such conventioneers. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR EXPANSION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS AND OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SUCH PROJECTS WILL BE JEOPARDIZED\nWe intend to finance our future expansion and renovation projects, as well as our other capital expenditures, primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility. If we are unable to finance our future expansion and renovation projects, or our other capital expenditures, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying or abandoning planned expansion and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, considering obtaining equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our Fourth Amended Credit Facility. These sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion, development, investment and renovation projects, and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nRISING OPERATING COSTS AT OUR GAMING PROPERTIES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS\nThe operating expenses associated with our properties could increase due to, among other reasons, the following factors:\n\u25cf changes in federal, state or local tax or regulations, including state gaming regulations or gaming taxes, could impose additional restrictions or increase our operating costs;\n\u25cf aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns by our competitors for an extended period of time could force us to increase our expenditures for marketing and promotional campaigns in order to maintain our existing customer base or attract new customers;\n\u25cf increases in costs of labor;\n\u25cf expenditures for repairs, maintenance, and to replace equipment necessary to operate our business;\n\u25cf our reliance on slot play revenues and any additional costs imposed on us from vendors;\n\u25cf availability and cost of the products and services we provide our customers, including food, beverages, retail items, entertainment, hotel rooms and spa;\n\u25cf availability and costs associated with insurance; and\n\u25cf our properties use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy, and energy price increases may adversely affect our cost structure.\n\u25cf continuing adverse impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, construction projects, financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf continuing actions by government officials at the federal, state and/or local level with respect to steps to be taken, including, without limitation, temporary or extended shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing and shelter-in-place orders, in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u25cf our ability to manage guest safety concerns caused by COVID-19;\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage and control expenses during temporary or extended shutdown periods;\n\u25cf impact of temporary or extended shutdowns on our ability to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of our credit facilities and other material contracts;\n\u25cf construction factors, including delays, disruptions, availability of labor and materials, increased costs of labor and materials, contractor disagreements, zoning issues, environmental restrictions, soil and water conditions, weather and other hazards, site access matters, building permit issues and other regulatory approvals or issues;\n\u25cf ongoing disagreements over costs of and responsibility for delays and other construction related matters with our Monarch Black Hawk general contractor, PCL Construction Services, Inc., including, as previously reported, the litigation against us and threatened liens by such contractor;\n\u25cf claims for construction defects, breach of contract, breach of warranty, fraud, fraudulent inducement, negligence or other construction related claims that we may have against our contractors in connection with construction and completion of Monarch Black Hawk and any adverse impacts on operations required to correct the same;\n\u25cf our filing of affirmative defenses and extensive counterclaims against the Monarch Black Hawk contractor, PCL Construction Services, Inc., in the above-mentioned litigation in which litigation the parties are currently conducting discovery, and investigation of the claims by and against us is therefore ongoing;\n\u25cf our potential need to post bonds or other forms of surety to support our legal remedies;\n\u25cf risks related to development and construction activities (including disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors; construction, equipment or staffing problems and delays; shortages of materials or skilled labor; environmental, health and safety issues; weather and other hazards, site access matters, and unanticipated cost increases);\n\u25cf our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to help finance our expansion plans and subsequent debt reduction;\n\u25cf changes in laws mandating increases in minimum wages and employee benefits;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations permitting expanded and other forms of gaming in our key markets;\n\u25cf the effects of local and national economic, credit and capital market conditions on the economy in general and on the gaming industry and our business in particular;\n\u25cf the effects of labor shortages on our market position, growth and financial results;\n\u25cf the potential of increases in state and federal taxation to address budgetary and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf the potential of increased regulatory and other burdens to address the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf guest acceptance of our expanded facilities once completed and the resulting impact on our market position, growth and financial results; and\nIf our operating expenses increase without any offsetting increase in our revenues, our results of operations would suffer.\nFAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, PROTECT OUR INTERNAL AND CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM CYBERSECURITY OR OTHER RISKS, OR COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to process customer transactions, manage customer data, manage employee data and communicate with third-party vendors and other third parties, and we may also access the internet to use our computer systems. Our operations require that we collect and store customer data, including credit card numbers and other personal information, for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. We also collect and store personal information about our employees. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Breaches of our security measures or information technology systems or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal information or confidential data about us, or our customers, or our employees including the potential loss or disclosure of such information as a result of hacking or other cyber-attack, computer virus, fraudulent use by customers, employees or employees of third party vendors, trickery or other forms of deception or unauthorized use, or due to system failure, could expose us, our customers, our employees or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our casino or brand names and reputations or otherwise harm our business. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of customer information, such as payment card, employee information and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly, however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data security measures could be significant.\nAdditionally, the collection of customer and employee personal information imposes various privacy compliance related obligations on our business and increases the risks associated with a breach or failure of the integrity of our information technology systems. The collection and use of personal information is governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our customers. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third party service providers engaged by us) may also result in damage of reputation, result in vulnerabilities that could be exploited to breach our systems and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of personal information.\nOUR GAMING OPERATIONS RELY HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY SERVICES AND AN UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF ELECTRICAL POWER\nAny unscheduled disruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, a failure of our information technology or related systems, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY GAMING AND OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US\nThe ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation. The State of Nevada, the State of Colorado and the applicable local authorities require various licenses, registrations, permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries. The Nevada Gaming Commission and the Colorado Commission may, among other things, limit, condition, suspend, revoke or decline to renew a license or approval to own the stock of our subsidiaries for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority. If we violate gaming laws or regulations, substantial fines could be levied against us, our subsidiaries and the persons involved, and we could be forced to forfeit a portion of our assets. The suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our current gaming activities. However, gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under Nevada and Colorado law. We cannot assure you that our existing licenses, permits and approvals will be maintained or extended.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, environmental matters, employment, currency transactions, taxation, construction, zoning, construction and land-use laws, marketing and advertising, smoking, and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit function assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years, the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry. Recent public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should make efforts to obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects may adversely impact our operations.\nThere is a growing consensus that greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. We may become subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult, burdensome and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators and regulators, stockholders and nongovernmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Many states have announced or adopted programs to stabilize and reduce GHG emissions and in the past federal legislation has been proposed in Congress. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Unless and until legislation is enacted and its terms are known, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or ability to compete. Further, regulation of GHG emissions may limit our guests\u2019 ability to travel to our properties as a result of increased fuel costs or restrictions on transport related emissions. Climate change could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We have described the risks to us associated with extreme weather events in the risk factors below.\nOUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGISLATION PROHIBITING TOBACCO SMOKING.\nLegislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in jurisdictions in which we operate. Colorado imposes such restrictions; our Nevada gaming areas are not currently subject to tobacco restrictions. If additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate, we could experience a decrease in gaming revenue. This is particularly the case if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market.\nIF GAMING TAXES AND FEES INCREASE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED\nThe federal government has, from time to time, considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future. State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, an economic downturn could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes or other fees. If the state and/or local governments where our properties are located were to increase gaming taxes and fees, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIF WE LOSE OUR KEY PERSONNEL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED\nWe depend on the continued performances of John Farahi and Bob Farahi, our Chief Executive Officer and our President, respectively, and their management team. If we lose the services of the Farahi brothers, or other senior Atlantis or Monarch Black Hawk management personnel, and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner with competent and experienced personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY STAFF OUR OPERATIONS\nFrom time to time, the competition for employees increases. During such times, new and growing business in the area may create job opportunities that at times have exceeded the area\u2019s supply of qualified employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or if competition for employees results in materially increased wages, our ability to maintain and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nWE OWN FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS\nExtreme weather or weather-related conditions, including snowstorms and forest or range fires may interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. If there is a prolonged disruption at either our Atlantis or Monarch Black Hawk properties due to extreme weather or weather-related conditions, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For example, extreme snow in and around the Black Hawk area often leads to closure of US 6 and I-70, the roads between Denver and Black Hawk. An excessive number of snow days in a fiscal period has, in the past, and would, in the future, have a negative effect on our guest visitations and adversely affect our revenue, results of operation and financial results for the reporting period.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs and loss of revenue that we incur as a result of some extreme weather or weather-related conditions, our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather or weather-related conditions. If any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather or weather-related conditions in the future, or if extreme weather or weather-related conditions adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. As we acquire properties, we may not know the full level of exposure that we may have undertaken despite appropriate due diligence.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. The Monarch Black Hawk is located within an area of historic mining activity and near superfund sites that have been the subject of state and federal clean-up actions. Although the Monarch Black Hawk is not part of a superfund site, the fact that such sites are in the vicinity and that mining activities occurred throughout the area, it is possible that as a result of our ownership and operation of Monarch Black Hawk (on which mining may have occurred in the past), we may incur costs related to this matter in the future. Furthermore, there may have been soil or groundwater contamination at certain of our properties resulting from current or former operations. We cannot assure that these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.\nCHANGES IN REGULATIONS ON LAND USE REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS\nChanges in regulations on land use requirements with regard to development of new hotel casinos in the proximity of the Atlantis and the Monarch Black Hawk could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A relaxation in such regulations could make it easier for competitors to enter our markets. A tightening of such regulations could adversely impact our future expansion opportunities.\nOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY HIGH-END PLAYERS\u2019 WINNINGS OR THEIR FAILURE TO REPAY FUNDS EXTENDED ON CREDIT\nAlthough not the major focus of our marketing efforts, we have selectively targeted high-end players. Should one or more of these high-end players win large sums in our casino, or should a material amount of credit extended to such players not be repaid, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWE FACE THE RISK OF FRAUD AND CHEATING\nOur gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK\nOUR COMMON STOCK PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY, AND A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S INVESTMENT COULD DECLINE IN VALUE\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, such as those described in the Risk Factors described herein and others, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf our sale of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf conditions and trends in the gaming and destination entertainment industries;\n\u25cf changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets;\n\u25cf general economic conditions, including, without limitation, changes in the cost of fuel and air travel; and\n\u25cf fears of impact on leisure and general travel due to pandemic concerns, include the coronavirus.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies\u2019 operating performance. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and/or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH WOULD LEAD TO DILUTION OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK\nIf we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, it would result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 equity interests in us. Our board of directors has the authority to issue, without vote or action of stockholders, preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue convertible preferred stock, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders\u2019 interest.\nIf our holders of outstanding options and rights to purchase shares of our common stock exercise their options or rights, and sell the underlying shares of common stock we issue upon such exercise, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the market price of our shares of common stock could decline. Further, the perception that such securities might be exercised could adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. In addition, during the time that such securities are outstanding, they may adversely affect the terms on which we could obtain additional capital.\nWE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS. AS A RESULT, STOCKHOLDERS WILL BENEFIT FROM AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK ONLY IF IT APPRECIATES IN VALUE\nWe have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we do not plan to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and further expansion and growth of our business, including acquisitions. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. We cannot guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nTHE CONCENTRATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE SLOT MACHINE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON OUR OPERATIONS\nA majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot machines operated at our gaming facilities. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer popular and technologically advanced slot machine games to our customers.\nIn recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically often require the payment of a fixed daily rental or a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability.\nGENERAL RISKS\nOUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MAY NOT RESULT IN THE EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nWe have expended a significant amount of capital on our multi-phased Monarch Black Hawk Expansion. We continuously invest in the upgrade and maintenance of our facilities to present a fresh, high quality product to our guests. Our ability to realize the expected returns on these capital investments depends on a number of factors, including, general economic conditions, changes to construction plans and specifications, delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, disputes with contractors, disruptions to our business caused by construction and other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.\nWhile we believe that the overall budgets for our planned capital expenditures are reasonable, these costs are estimates and the actual costs may be higher than expected. In addition, we cannot assure you that these investments will be sufficient or that we will realize our expected returns on our capital investments, or any returns at all. If we fail to realize our expected returns on capital investments, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCHANGES IN LEGISLATION AND REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS\nRegulations governing the conduct of gaming activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change and could impose additional operating, financial, competitive or other burdens on the way we conduct our business.\nIn particular, certain areas of law governing new gaming activities, such as the federal and state law applicable to sports betting, are new or developing in light of emerging technologies. New and developing areas of law may be subject to the interpretation of the government agencies tasked with enforcing them. In some circumstances, a government agency may interpret a statute or regulation in one manner and then reconsider its interpretation at a later date. No assurance can be provided that government agencies will interpret or enforce new or developing areas of law consistently, predictably, or favorably. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our business may be introduced in the future in states where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations or enactment of other adverse regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL POSSIBLE LOSSES THAT OUR PROPERTIES COULD SUFFER. IN ADDITION, OUR INSURANCE COSTS MAY INCREASE AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE SAME INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE\nAlthough we have general property insurance covering damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire and natural disasters), each such policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance is in an amount that may be less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the applicable complex if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as public health emergencies, including pandemics such as the COVID-19, labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, might not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts, events or conditions could expose us to heavy, uninsured losses.\nIn addition, although we currently have insurance coverage for occurrences of terrorist acts and for certain losses that could result from these acts, our terrorism coverage is subject to the same risks and deficiencies as those described above for our general property coverage. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses in the event that any damages occur, directly or indirectly, as a result of terrorist attacks or otherwise, which could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nIn addition to the damage caused to our property by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in such event.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Among other factors, it is possible that homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits) and additional exclusions from coverage. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect not to, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nOur debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS, AN OUTBREAK OF HIGHLY INFECTIOUS DISEASE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, GUN VIOLENCE OR WAR MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS\nNatural disasters, man-made disasters and outbreaks of highly infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 may result in decreases in travel to and from, and economic activity in, areas in which we operate, and may adversely affect the number of visitors to our properties. In addition, catastrophic events, such as terrorist and war activities in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming and tourism. If any of the foregoing events occur in the future, they could disrupt our operations, including our ability to staff our business adequately, damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have insurance coverage with respect to some of these disasters or events, we cannot assure you that any such coverage will be sufficient to indemnify us fully against all direct and indirect costs, including any loss of business that could result from substantial damage to, or partial or complete destruction of, any of our properties.", "PERMNO": 79507, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "MCRI"}
