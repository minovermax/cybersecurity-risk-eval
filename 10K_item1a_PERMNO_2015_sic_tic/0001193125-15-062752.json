RISK FACTORS.\nThe statements under this heading describe the most significant risks to the Company\u2019s business identified by management and should be considered carefully in conjunction with the discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. However, predicting or identifying all such risks and uncertainties is not possible. As a result, the following factors should not be considered to be a complete discussion of the Company\u2019s risks and uncertainties.\nCompetitors may develop products that make the Company\u2019s products obsolete or less competitive.\nThe CAM2 market is characterized by rapid technological change. Competitors may develop new or improved products, processes or technologies that may make the Company\u2019s products obsolete or less competitive.\nAs a result, the Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on its ability to maintain its technological advantage by developing new products and applications and enhancing its existing products, which can be complex and time-consuming and require substantial investment by the Company. Significant delays in new product releases or difficulties in\ndeveloping new products could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company can provide no assurance that it will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or maintain its technological advantage.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is dependent on the conditions of various industries, including the automotive, aerospace, and heavy equipment industries, which have from time to time experienced, and may again experience, significant disruptions in the economic environment.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s sales are to manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace, and heavy equipment industries. The Company is dependent upon the continued viability and financial stability of its customers in these industries, which are highly cyclical and dependent upon the general health of the economy and consumer spending.\nReductions in defense spending could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s customers operate in the defense sector and depend significantly on U.S. government spending. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 which imposes spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over the next ten years. Automatic spending reductions, referred to as sequestration, were implemented in March 2013. Ongoing budgetary discussions in the federal government may result in other cuts to defense spending. Reductions in defense spending that impact the aerospace and defense industries could have an adverse affect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe buying process for most of the Company\u2019s customers for the its measurement products is highly decentralized and typically requires significant time and expense for the Company to further penetrate the potential market of a specific customer, which may delay the Company\u2019s ability to generate additional revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on its ability to further penetrate its customer base. During 2014, approximately 63% of the Company\u2019s revenue was attributable to sales to its existing customers. If the Company is not able to continue to further penetrate its existing customer base, its sales growth may decline. However, most of the Company\u2019s customers have a decentralized buying process for measurement devices, and the Company must spend significant time and resources to increase revenues from a specific customer. For example, the Company may provide products to only one of its customer\u2019s manufacturing facilities or for a specific product line within a manufacturing facility. The Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be able to maintain or increase the amount of sales to its existing customers, which could adversely affect its financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to protect its patents and proprietary rights in the United States and foreign countries could adversely affect its revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary right protection for its processes and products in the United States and other countries. The Company also relies upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing inventions to maintain its competitive position. The Company seeks to protect its technology and trade secrets, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees and contractors. However, the Company\u2019s employees may breach these agreements or the Company\u2019s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by inventors. If the Company is unable to obtain or maintain protection of its patents, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, it may not be able to prevent third parties from using its proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s patent protection involves complex legal and technical questions. Its patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Further, the Company may be able to protect its proprietary rights from infringement by third parties only to the extent that its proprietary processes and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around the Company\u2019s patented technologies. Litigation or other proceedings to defend or enforce its intellectual property rights could require the Company to spend significant time and money, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nClaims from others that the Company infringes their intellectual property rights may adversely affect its business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, the Company receives notices from others claiming it infringes their intellectual property rights. Resolving these claims may require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require it to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or require it to pay damages. In addition, from time to time, the Company is involved in intellectual property lawsuits. The Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition. Any litigation or interference proceedings, regardless of their outcome, may be costly and may require significant time and attention of the Company\u2019s management and technical personnel.\nProduct failures or product availability and performance issues could result in increased warranty costs, delays in new product introductions and enhancements and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company regularly introduces new products and enhances existing products. Failures in the Company\u2019s new or existing products could result in increased warranty costs, delays in new product introductions, and a loss of sales and customers and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve financial results within its target goals, and its operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to achieve financial results that are within its goals is subject to a number of factors beyond its control. Moreover, the Company\u2019s annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future. Factors that cause the Company\u2019s financial results to fluctuate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the manufacturing industry and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales promotions;\n\u2022\ngeographic expansion in the Asia-Pacific region and other regions;\n\u2022\ntraining and ramp-up time for new sales people;\n\u2022\ninvestments in strategic sales, product or other initiatives;\n\u2022\ninvestments in technologies and new products and product enhancements, including costs associated with new development and product introductions and the timing and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nshrinkage or other inventory losses due to product obsolescence, scrap or material price changes;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the Company\u2019s manufacturing capability;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of customer orders, many of which are received towards the end of the quarter;\n\u2022\nthe amount of time that it takes to fulfill orders and ship the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nthe length of the Company\u2019s sales cycle to new customers;\n\u2022\ncustomer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nstart-up costs and ramp-up time associated with opening new sales offices outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nvariations in the effective income tax rate and the difficulty in predicting the tax rate on a quarterly and annual basis; and\n\u2022\nlitigation and regulatory action brought against the Company.\nAny one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s annual and quarterly operating results in the future and could cause it to fail to achieve its target financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s growth depends on the ability of the Company\u2019s products to attain broad market acceptance.\nThe market for traditional fixed-base CMMs, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and surveying equipment is mature. Part of the Company\u2019s strategy is to continue to displace these traditional measurement devices. Displacing traditional measurement devices and achieving broad market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products requires significant effort to convince customers to reevaluate their historical measurement procedures and methodologies.\nThe potential size and growth rate of the CAM2 market is uncertain and difficult to quantify. If the CAM2 market does not continue to expand or does not expand as quickly as the Company anticipates, it may not be able to grow its sales, which may affect its financial results.\nThe Company markets seven closely interdependent products (FaroArm, FARO Laser ScanArm, FARO Gage, FARO Laser Tracker, FARO 3D Imager AMP, FARO Focus3D and FARO Freestyle3D) and related software for use in measurement, inspection, and high density surveying applications. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s revenues are currently derived from sales of these products and software, and it plans to continue its business strategy of focusing on the software-driven, 3-D measurement and inspection market. Consequently, the Company\u2019s financial performance will depend in large part on computer-based measurement, inspection, and high density surveying products achieving broad market acceptance. If its products cannot attain broad market acceptance, the Company will not grow as anticipated and may be required to make increased expenditures on research and development for new applications or new products.\nThe Company competes with manufacturers of measurement systems and traditional measurement devices, many of which have more resources than the Company and may develop new products and technologies.\nThe broad market for measurement devices is highly competitive. In the FARO Gage product line, the Company competes with manufacturers of handheld measurement tools and fixed-base CMMs, including some large, well-established companies. In the FaroArm, FARO Laser ScanArm, FARO Laser Tracker, FARO Focus3D and FARO 3D Imager AMP product lines, the Company competes primarily with Hexagon Metrology, a division of Hexagon AB, and with Steinbichler Optotechink GmbH and GOM mbH in the 3D Imager product lines. The Company also competes in these product lines with a number of other smaller competitors. The Company competes on the basis of technical innovation, product performance, quality, and price with respect to all of its products.\nThe Company will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain the technological advantage that it believes it currently has over its competition. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than it possesses. Moreover, the Company cannot be certain that its technology or its product development efforts will allow it to successfully compete as the industry evolves. As the market for its measurement systems expands, additional competition may emerge and the Company\u2019s existing and future competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which the Company participates. The Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by pricing strategies pursued by competitors or technological or product developments by competitors.\nThe Company derives a substantial part of its revenues from its international operations, which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than its domestic operations.\nThe Company derives more than half of its revenues from international operations. The Company\u2019s international operations are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\nlonger customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ncompliance with export and import regulations and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to the Company from its operations outside the United States; and\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices.\nSeveral of the countries where the Company operates have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and any measures that it may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of its international operations may not be effective.\nBecause a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, the Company faces significant exposure to foreign exchange rate risk.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates which can cause significant fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly and annual results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, and could result in potentially significant foreign exchange gains and losses. To the extent that the percentage of its non-U.S. dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future, the Company\u2019s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase.\nThe Company is subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certification processes and regulations, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, import and export of products, currency conversions and repatriation, taxation of foreign earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and use of local employees and suppliers. An inability to comply with these regulations or obtain any necessary certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nManufacturers of electrical goods are subject to the European Union\u2019s RoHS2 and WEEE directives, which took effect during 2006. RoHS2 prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products, and WEEE makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of covered electronic products and components. Parallel initiatives are being proposed in other jurisdictions, including several states in the United States and China.\nThe Company currently holds WEEE registration and is in compliance with the directives of the European Union. Under the classification of \u201cIndustrial Monitoring and Control Instruments,\u201d the Company\u2019s products have until July 22, 2017 to become compliant with the RoHS2 directive. Currently, only the FARO Laser Tracker ION does not meet the RoHS2 directive. However, if the Company is unable to bring the FARO Laser Tracker ION into compliance with the RoHS2 directive by July 22, 2017, it would be unable to sell the FARO Laser Tracker ION in European Union countries and China, and potentially in several states in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on its sales and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-corruption laws could subject the Company to fines and penalties.\nIn 2012, the Company\u2019s monitorship expired pursuant to its settlement with the SEC and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, concerning certain payments made by the Company\u2019s China subsidiary that may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other applicable laws. The Company is, of course, still subject to such laws and has adopted and maintains a compliance plan designed to ensure compliance with these laws; however, in light of the Company\u2019s prior conduct, any future failure to comply with any such continuing obligations could result in the SEC and the DOJ aggressively seeking to impose penalties against the Company in the future. In addition, many countries in which the Company operates have increased regulation regarding anti-corruption practices generally. Compliance with such regulations could be costly and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations or delay entry into new markets.\nThe Company may not be able to identify or consummate acquisitions or achieve expected benefits from acquisitions, which could harm its growth.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy partly depends on its ability to obtain additional technologies, complementary product lines and sales channels through selective acquisitions\nand strategic investments. The Company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions, if necessary, on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In the past, the Company has used its stock as consideration for acquisitions. The Company\u2019s common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting the Company\u2019s existing shareholders, and potential acquisition candidates may not view the Company\u2019s stock attractively.\nIn addition, realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the sales and marketing, distribution, manufacturing, engineering, software development, customer service, finance and administrative organizations of the acquired companies. The integration of acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the management of the acquired companies. Any acquisition may be subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to assimilate effectively the operations, products, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies (some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions);\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of relationships with customers.\nThe Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be able to identify or complete suitable acquisitions, integrate successfully any acquisitions, that any acquired companies will operate profitably, or that it will realize the expected synergies and other benefits from any acquisition.\nThe Company may face difficulties managing the effects of its growth.\nIf its business grows rapidly in the future, the Company expects it to result in:\n\u2022\nincreased complexity;\n\u2022\nincreased responsibility for existing and new management personnel; and\n\u2022\nincremental strain on its operations and financial and management systems.\nIf the Company is not able to manage the effects of its future growth, its business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s dependence on suppliers for materials could impair its ability to manufacture its products.\nOutside vendors provide key components used by the Company in the manufacture of its products. Any supply interruption in a limited source component would harm its ability to manufacture its products until a new source of supply is identified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component, either known or unknown to the Company, or incompatibility with its manufacturing processes could harm its ability to manufacture its products. The Company may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If the Company fails to obtain a supplier for the manufacture of components of its potential products, it may experience delays or interruptions in its operations, which would adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe disclosure requirements under the \u201cconflict minerals\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could increase the Company\u2019s costs and limit the supply of certain metals used in its products and affect its reputation with customers and shareholders.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements, which became effective in 2014, for public companies using certain minerals and metals in their products. These minerals and metals are generally referred to as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d regardless of their country of origin. Under these rules, the Company is required to perform due diligence and disclose its efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. Conflict minerals are commonly used in the manufacture of electronics and may be incorporated in the Company\u2019s products. As a result of these new regulations, the Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the conflict minerals used in the Company\u2019s products. These new requirements could also adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals, and the pool of suppliers who provide \u201cconflict free\u201d metals may be limited. As a result, the Company or its suppliers may not be able to obtain materials necessary for production of the Company\u2019s products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. In addition, since the Company\u2019s supply chain is complex, it may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of all metals used in its products and confirm that they are \u201cconflict free,\u201d which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of sales or decreased profitability.\nThe Company may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to support its growth. In addition, the loss of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, or other key personnel, could adversely affect its sales, profitability or growth. Moreover, the Company continues to rely in part on equity awards to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may result in an increase in compensation expense.\nRisks generally associated with the Company\u2019s information systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business reputation and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on its information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:\n\u2022\nfacilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items;\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022\naccurately bill and collect from customers;\n\u2022\nprocess payments to suppliers and employees; and\n\u2022\nsummarize results and manage the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of the Company\u2019s critical business computer systems or failure of its back-up systems could lead to a loss of sales or decreased profitability.\nA cyberattack or security breach of the Company\u2019s systems may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the Company\u2019s internal data, the availability of the Company\u2019s products and websites designed to support the Company\u2019s customers, or the Company\u2019s customer data. Computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to penetrate the Company\u2019s network security and the Company\u2019s website. Unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, or breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage the Company\u2019s network security or the Company\u2019s website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, suppliers or other vendors. Any security breach, cyberattack or cyber security breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, sensitive or confidential customer information, whether by the Company or by one of its vendors, could require the Company to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, interrupt its operations and damage its reputation, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation and results of operations.\nThe Company is in the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning, or ERP system, which is expected to be completed in phases over the next year. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities. During implementation, the Company may encounter difficulties in operating its business, which could disrupt operations, including the ability to timely ship customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage the supply chain, and otherwise adequately service customers, and lead to increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant delays or disruptions during the implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to risks of natural disasters.\nThe Company has manufacturing facilities in each of its regions. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather where the Company has a manufacturing facility could result in physical damage to, and complete or partial closure of, the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial performance. Interruptions in the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations or damage to its manufacturing facilities could reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and increase its costs and the extent of losses from natural disasters and severe weather will be a function of both the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage, it can offer no assurance that its insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses or that it will be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost in the future. If losses from business interruption or property damage exceed the amounts for which the Company is insured, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Company may experience volatility in its stock price.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to various factors, many of which are beyond its control, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for, and sales of, the Company\u2019s products or prolonged downturns in the industries that the Company serves;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic uncertainties;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by the Company or its competitors.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may also be affected by its inability to meet analyst and investor expectations and failure to achieve projected financial results. Any failure to meet such expectations or projected financial results, even if minor, could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline significantly. Volatility in its stock price may result in the inability of the Company\u2019s shareholders to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nThe Company\u2019s relatively small public float and daily trading volume have in the past caused, and may in the future result in, significant volatility in its stock price. At December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately 17.0 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. The Company\u2019s daily trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2014 averaged approximately 128,303 shares.\nIn addition, stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In the past, securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against such companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies\u2019 securities. If any such litigation is instigated against the Company, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, its bylaws and provisions of Florida law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, its bylaws and provisions of Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company. Although the Company believes such provisions are appropriate to protect long-term value for its shareholders, these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s shares. Because of these provisions, you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na limitation on shareholders\u2019 ability to call a special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements to nominate directors for election to the Company\u2019s board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s classified board of directors, which means that approximately one-third of its directors are elected each year; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nThe provisions described above could delay or make more difficult transactions involving a change in control of the Company or its management.", "PERMNO": 85372, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "FARO"}
