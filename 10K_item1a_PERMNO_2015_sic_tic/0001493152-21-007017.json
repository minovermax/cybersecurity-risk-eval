RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could be decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 pandemic might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a \u201cpandemic.\u201d The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in, and a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases could result in, a widespread health crisis that could materially and adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the operations and financial position of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors, if the target company\u2019s personnel, vendors and service providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner, or if COVID-19 causes a prolonged economic downturn. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to consummate a business combination may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCOVID-19 could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as a portion of our workforce is required to work from home and therefore new processes, procedures, and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment. Further, should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, the attention of the management team and resources could be diverted.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 could also heighten the risks we face related to each of the risk factors disclosed below. As COVID-19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving, the potential impacts to these risk factors remain uncertain. As a result, COVID-19 may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider may present significant risks to our operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company.\nWe were incorporated in Nevada in July 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have generated $2,254,811 and $4,484,822, respectively, in revenues and incurred net losses of $3,752,953 and $1,349,478, respectively. The likelihood of our success must be considered in the light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we are operating. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:\n\u25cf our ability to market our product and services;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues; and\n\u25cf our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue marketing and developing our product.\nWe are not currently profitable and may not become profitable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,086,753 cash on hand and our Greenpro\u2019s common stockholders\u2019 equity was $8,395,602. We have generated $2,254,811 in revenue in 2020 and have incurred operating loss of $2,905,575 and net loss of $3,752,953. We expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future due to operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business.\nWe may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $3,752,953 and used cash in operating activities of $1,567,758, and at December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $3,411,175. In addition, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company\u2019s December 31, 2020 audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company\u2019s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, if necessary, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nOur operating results may prove unpredictable which could negatively affect our profit.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which we have no control. Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly include: our inability to generate enough working capital from future equity sales; the level of commercial acceptance by clients of our services; fluctuations in the demand for our service the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure and general economic conditions. If realized, any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our service or establish a significant market presence, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nOur growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully market our service to prospective clients. However, our planned services may not achieve significant acceptance. Such acceptance, if achieved, may not be sustained for any significant period of time. Failure of our services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations.\nManagement\u2019s ability to implement the business strategy may be slower than expected and we may be unable to generate a profit.\nOur business plans, including offering a cloud accounting system and consulting services, may not occur. Our growth strategy is subject to significant risks which you should carefully consider before purchasing our shares.\nOur services may be slow to achieve profitability, or may not become profitable at all, which will result in losses. There can be no assurance that we will succeed.\nWe may be unable to enter into our intended markets successfully. The factors that could affect our growth strategy include our success in (a) developing our business plan, (b) obtaining our clients, (c) obtaining adequate financing on acceptable terms, and (d) adapting our internal controls and operating procedures to accommodate our future growth.\nOur systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support the expansion of our business operations. Significant growth will place managerial demands on all aspects of our operations. Our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical, administrative and financial controls and reporting systems.\nCompetitors may enter this sector with superior service which would affect our business adversely.\nWe believe that barriers to entry are low to medium because of economies of scale, cost advantage and brand identity. Potential competitors may enter this sector with superior services. This would have an adverse effect upon our business and our results of operations. In addition, a high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and recurring sales of our services. Despite having accumulated customers from the past four years, we may still need to continue to improve our platform and software in order to assist potential customers in using our platform, and we also need to provide effective support to future clients. If we are unable to increase customer support and improve our platform in the face of increasing competition, with the increase in competition, our ability to sell our services to potential customers could adversely affect our brand, which would harm our reputation.\nOur use of open source and third-party software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our services.\nWe intend to incorporate open-source software into our platform. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts or jurisdictions elsewhere, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our services. We could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open-source software incorporated into our products. In either event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue our services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also intend to incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our website and may need to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in releases of our platform until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Any disruption in our access to software programs or third-party technologies could result in significant delays in releases of our platform and could require substantial effort to locate or develop a replacement program. If we decide in the future to incorporate into our products any other software program licensed from a third party, and the use of such software program is necessary for the proper operation of our appliances, then our loss of any such license would similarly adversely affect our ability to release our products in a timely fashion.\nThe security of our computer systems may be compromised and harm our business.\nA significant portion of our business operations is conducted through use of our computer network. Although we intend to implement security systems and procedures to protect the confidential information stored on these computer systems, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties. As well, they may be able to create system disruptions, shutdowns or effect denial of service attacks. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our networks or client computers, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, or that misappropriate and distribute confidential information stored on these computer systems. Any of the foregoing could result in damage to our reputation and customer confidence in the security of our products and services and could require us to incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate the problem. Additionally, our ability to transact business may be affected. Such damage, expenditures and business interruption could seriously impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations focus on utilizing the sales efforts which are principally located in South-East Asia and East Asia. As a result, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition depend upon the demand for our services in these regions. Lack of broad diversification in the industry type and geographic location, adverse developments in our current segment of the midstream industry, or in our existing areas of operation, could have a greater impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition than if our operations were more diversified.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in South-East Asia and East Asia\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nOur business operations are conducted in South-East Asia and East Asia. Accordingly, the results of our operations, financial condition and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal conditions of the South-East Asia and East Asia countries where we intend to develop business. Following the closing of our initial public offering in 2017, we derive a significant portion of our revenues and earnings from Hong Kong, our principal business place, PRC, Malaysia and other South-East Asia countries, respectively. Operation in multiple foreign countries involves substantial risk. For example, our operations and business activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and security requirements, labor laws, intellectual property laws, privacy laws, and anti-competition regulations. As we expand into additional countries, the complexity inherent in complying with these laws and regulations increases, making compliance more difficult and costly and driving up the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, make it more difficult or impossible to do business in that country and harm our reputation.\nThe Hong Kong economy may be vulnerable to slowdown in Chinese activity and world trade.\nSince Hong Kong is now closely linked to China with respect to economic and political development, Hong Kong economic and political development will be more likely to be affected by China\u2019s development. As there are more and more mainland Chinese companies listed on The Hong Kong Stock Exchange and industries in general are becoming delocalized to mainland China, the Hong Kong stock market and local economy will become more vulnerable to the economic development in the mainland China. If the economic development in China becomes unstable, the Hong Kong economy will be negatively affected. Besides, the Hong Kong economy is externally oriented and highly dependent on trade with the rest of the world. Our business may be subject to the cyclical effect of the economic development in the world, including the adverse impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nOutbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The international stock markets reflect the uncertainty associated with the slow-down in the global economy and the reduced levels of international travel experienced since the beginning of January 2020, large declines in oil prices and the significant decline in the Dow Industrial Average at the end of February and beginning of March 2020 was largely attributed to the effects of COVID-19. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and the pandemic is still ongoing. The extent to which the COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken globally to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, the efficacy of vaccines on COVID-19 and its variants, among others. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from all such possible events. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event and may hamper our efforts to contact our service providers and advisors and to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations with the SEC, especially in the event of office closures, stay-in-place orders and a ban on travel or quarantines. We are still assessing our business operations and the impact COVID-19 may have on our results and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-019 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.\nWe face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the central government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions of the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social environment.\nIntroduction of new laws or changes to existing laws by the PRC government may adversely affect our business.\nThe PRC legal system is a codified legal system made up of written laws, regulations, circulars, administrative directives and internal guidelines. Unlike common law jurisdictions like the U.S., decided cases (which may be taken as reference) do not form part of the legal structure of the PRC and thus have no binding effect on subsequent cases with similar issues and fact patterns. Furthermore, in line with its transformation from a centrally planned economy to a relatively free market economy, the PRC government is still in the process of developing a comprehensive set of laws and regulations. As the legal system in the PRC is still evolving, laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same may be subject to further changes. For example, the PRC government may impose restrictions on the amount of service fees that may be payable by municipal governments to wastewater and sludge treatment service providers. Also, the PRC central and municipal governments may impose more stringent environmental regulations which would affect our ability to comply with, or our costs to comply with, such regulations. Such changes, if implemented, may adversely affect our business operations and may reduce our profitability\nWe face the risk that changes in the world economy and political developments in Malaysia may adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, there have been political instabilities in the Malaysian government which may reduce investors\u2019 confidence, result in reduction in foreign direct investment and weigh on consumer and business sentiment, depressing growth. In addition, the Malaysian economy is reliant on external demand. Any possible worsening global demand is likely to hinder the export development and any economic weakness may possibly lead to market intervention and the government may impose capital controls. Under these circumstances, our business operation may be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We will have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in South-East Asia and East Asia, which may experience corruption. Our proposed activities in South-East Asia and East Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, or sales agents of our Company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It will be our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. Also, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, or sales agents of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nWe are a Nevada corporation but most of our assets are and will be located outside of the United States. Almost all our operations are conducted in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the PRC. In addition, most of our officers and directors are the nationals and residents of a country other than the United States. Most of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon them. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, since he or she is not a resident in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Hong Kong or other Asian countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts.\nPayment of dividends is subject to restrictions under Nevada, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the PRC laws.\nUnder Nevada law, we may only pay dividends subject to our ability to service our debts as they become due and provided that our assets will exceed our liabilities after the payment of such dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will therefore depend on our ability to generate adequate profits. Under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, we are permitted to make payments of dividends from distributable profits (that is, accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses). Under the Laws of Malaysia, we may only make a distribution to the shareholders out of our profits available if we are solvent. The Company is regarded as solvent if the Company can pay its debts as and when the debts become due within twelve months immediately after the distribution is made. In addition, because of a variety of rules applicable to our operations in China and the regulations on foreign investments as well as the applicable tax law, we may be subject to further limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe can give no assurance that we will declare dividends of any amounts, at any rate or at all in the future. The declaration of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial conditions, legal and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nTogether, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Chong Kuang, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert own a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of our corporate matters.\nMr. Lee Chong Kuang, our CEO, beneficially owns 27.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, and Mr. Loke Che Chan Gilbert, our CFO, beneficially owns 27.85% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, Messrs. Lee and Loke are collectively able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership in our shares by executive officers will limit the other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in the de-listing of our Common Stock.\nOn November 29, 2019, we received a letter from Nasdaq which stated that, based upon the closing bid price of our Common Stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we no longer met the requirement set forth in NASDAQ Rule 5450(a)(1), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Rule\u201d). In accordance with NASDAQ Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided with a period of 180 calendar days, or until May 27, 2020, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, including the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so.\nOn May 27, 2020, we regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule to maintain the bid price of our Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of the shares of Common Stock by existing shareholders could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nIf our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of the shares, then the market price of our Common Stock could fall. Such sales by our existing shareholders might make it more difficult for us to issue new equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and place we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of shares, the prevailing market price for our shares could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our shares is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf variations in our actual and perceived operating results;\n\u25cf news regarding gains or losses of customers or partners by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf news regarding gains or losses of key personnel by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of competitive developments, acquisitions or strategic alliances in our industry by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u25cf potential litigation;\n\u25cf general market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; and\n\u25cf the operating and stock price performance of other companies, other industries and other events or factors beyond our control.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of certain companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the shares.\nIn case that our shares trade under $5.00 per share they will be considered penny stock. Trading in penny stocks has many restrictions and these restrictions could severely affect the price and liquidity of our shares.\nIf our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our Common Stock would be considered as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established Members and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our Common Stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stocks is often volatile, and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Presently, we intend to retain all our earnings, if any, to finance development and expansion of our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our Common Stock appreciates.", "PERMNO": 17885, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "GRNQ"}
