{"cik": "883943", "company": "CHRISTOPHER & BANKS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks. Thus, an investment in our stock is also subject to risk. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements that are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cReport\u201d), as well as certain of our other filings with the SEC. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the trading price of our stock and/or the outcome of matters with respect to which forward-looking statements are made in this Report. The risk factors described below should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be other risk factors not identified in this Report, that are either not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, that could cause materially adverse effects.\nAll of our stores are located within the United States, making us highly susceptible to macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the United States, and both of these factors may have a significant impact on consumer demand for our apparel and accessories.\nThe demand for our products is influenced by national, regional and local economic factors, and how those factors in turn influence consumer spending levels. Apparel retailing is a volatile industry that is highly dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending. Purchases of specialty apparel and related goods tend to be highly correlated with levels of disposable income for consumers and overall consumer confidence. Because apparel generally is a discretionary purchase, declines in consumer spending may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than on other retailers.\nFactors that could adversely affect the demand for our products include recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, any or all of which could have an adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, economic conditions could negatively impact the Company's retail landlords and their ability to maintain their shopping centers, including a high level of sustained occupancy, and otherwise perform their obligations, which in turn could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe ability to attract customers to our stores that are located in regional malls and other shopping centers depends heavily on the attractiveness of the malls and the centers in which our stores are located, and any decrease in customer traffic to and occupancy at these malls and centers could cause our sales to be less than expected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe majority of our current stores are located in shopping malls and other retail centers. Sales at these stores are derived in considerable part from the volume of traffic generated in those malls or retail centers and surrounding areas. To take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers, we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations may be strong. Our stores benefit from the ability of nearby tenants to generate consumer traffic near our stores, and the continuing popularity of the regional malls and outlet, lifestyle and power centers where our stores are located. Customer traffic and, in turn, our sales volume may be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors. A continued reduction in customer traffic could result in lower sales and leave us with excess inventory. In such circumstances, we may have to respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which could adversely impact our financial results and business.\nImproving our store productivity will be largely dependent upon the performance of our missy, petite and women\u2019s format (\u201cMPW stores\u201d) including our outlet stores, as well as in maintaining or increasing customer traffic in our stores and converting that traffic into sales.\nImproving the performance of our existing stores, in particular outlets, and optimizing our store productivity is critical to improving our sales and returning to profitability. Over the past several years, the Company has opened a number of outlet stores and either opened or converted existing stores into MPW stores such that approximately 83% of our stores (including outlets) at fiscal year-end were in the MPW format, up from 75% at the end of the prior fiscal year. If we are unable to improve the overall performance and store productivity of the MPW stores, our revenues, margins, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing all of our store locations.\nWe currently lease all of our store locations. Our leases range from month-to-month to approximately ten years in length. A number of our leases have early termination provisions that apply if we do not achieve specified sales levels after an initial term and, in some cases, allow us to pay rent based on a percent of sales if we fail to achieve certain specified sales levels. The leases for approximately 33% of our store base expire between February 1, 2017 and January 31, 2018, including those leases which are month to month. We believe that, over the last few years, we have generally been able to negotiate favorable rental rates and extend leases due, in part, to the state of the economy and higher than usual vacancy rates. It is possible this trend may not continue and that we may not be able to renew our leases on as favorable terms, or in certain circumstances, at all. As a result, we may need to pay higher occupancy costs or close stores, which could adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and ability to generate positive cash flow.\nOur business has recently undergone a change in Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and changes to our business operations are expected to follow. If we do not successfully implement and adapt to these changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter, LuAnn Via, CEO left the Company, Joel Waller was named interim President & CEO and we announced a search for a permanent CEO. In connection with the recent change in management, and potentially following the hiring of a permanent CEO, we anticipate that there will be changes to the Company\u2019s operations as well as with respect to its key strategies and tactical initiatives. If we do not successfully implement and adapt to these changes they may not lead to the desired improvement in our business and results of operation. This in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to increase sales and achieve and sustain an acceptable level of gross margin, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, profitability and liquidity.\nWe experienced a significant shortfall in sales in the fourth fiscal quarter which had a negative impact on our financial results. For the full fiscal year total sales, comparable stores sales and gross margin were slightly below or flat as compared to fiscal 2015 results. Our ability to reverse this trend and improve our sales performance and gross margin is subject to a variety of challenges. The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to consumers, which could cause our overall sales and gross margin to decline further if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs or cost of goods. If our sales decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, it will adversely impact our gross margin and operating income. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur fiscal 2017 plan to improve the Company\u2019s financial performance is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement our strategic and tactical initiatives.\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal 2017 operational plan contemplates modest growth in sales; improved selling, general and administrative expense leverage; and gross margin expansion intended to result in improved operating income as compared to fiscal 2016. Our ability to achieve this plan depends upon a variety of factors, including a number of factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully implement and execute the strategic and tactical initiatives underlying our fiscal 2017 plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur sales and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain or recruit key personnel as well as attract, develop and retain qualified employees.\nWe are currently searching for a permanent CEO. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our CEO, members of senior management and other key personnel. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance to our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. A significant amount of turnover of senior management employees with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. Also, if we are unable to recruit, train and assimilate a sufficient number of qualified sales associates that may impair our efficiency and effectiveness in serving our customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive retail apparel industry. The size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could reduce our revenues and gross margin.\nThe women's specialty retail apparel business is highly competitive. We believe we compete primarily with department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, and on line businesses that sell women's apparel. Many of our competitors are significantly larger with greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources available to them, may offer a broader selection of merchandise than we do, and have greater brand recognition and comparatively lower costs of operations. They may be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Given their greater financial resources and larger staff, our competitors may be better able to prioritize and manage large or complex projects, as well as respond more quickly to economic, operational, regulatory or organizational changes. Further, we do not typically advertise using television or radio media and thus do not reach customers through methods some of our competitors may use. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable store locations, lease terms and qualified associates. Increased competition in any of these areas may result in higher costs, which could reduce our revenue and gross margins.\nFailure to maintain our reputation and brand image or to successfully execute our marketing initiatives could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business as well as the implementation of strategies to expand it. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brand will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. In addition, while our brand is mature, our success depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to shop our brand, both in-store and on line. Successful marketing efforts require the ability to reach customers through various methods of communication. A number of our marketing programs are planned well in advance of the date by which the related product is available for sale. If we are unable to accurately predict our customers\u2019 preferences, to utilize their desired mode of communication, or to ensure availability of advertised products that could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn addition, the receipt of negative publicity could adversely impact our brand and the brand loyalty of our customers, which would adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to anticipate or react to changing consumer preferences in a timely and accurate manner and offer a compelling product at an attractive price impacts our sales, gross margins and results of operations.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to consistently gauge and respond on a timely basis to fashion trends and provide a balanced assortment of merchandise that satisfies changing fashion tastes and our customers\u2019 demands for style, fit, quality and price, which preferences can vary considerably both among our customer demographic and throughout the geographic areas in which we operate. Forecasting consumer demand for our merchandise and allocating the right amount and sizes of such merchandise to individual stores and to our eCommerce business can be challenging. In addition, our merchandise assortment differs from season to season and, at any given time, our assortment may not resonate with our customers in terms of style, fit, quality or price. Generally, we begin the design process for apparel six to eight months before the merchandise is available to customers, and we typically begin to make purchase commitments several months in advance of deliveries to stores. These lead times can make it difficult for us to respond quickly to changes in the demand for our products or to adjust the cost of the product in response to customers' fashion or price preferences. Any missteps may affect merchandise desirability and gross margins, and result in excess inventory levels, which could impair our profitability.\nIf we miscalculate the market for our merchandise, our customers' tastes or purchasing habits or the demand for our products, we may have fewer sales at an acceptable mark-up over cost. As a result, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would have an adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operations. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales opportunities and lost revenues.\nThere are risks associated with our eCommerce business.\nWe sell merchandise over the Internet through our web site, www.christopherandbanks.com, which represents a growing percentage of our overall net sales. The successful operation of our eCommerce business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and continuous operation of our eCommerce websites and our fulfillment operations, and to provide a shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to our site. Our eCommerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated operating problems;\n\u2022\nrapid technological change;\n\u2022\nthe successful implementation of, and costs to implement, new systems and upgrades including those related to the operation of our new website platform;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties with respect to the operation of the website, order fulfillment and customer service and such third parties' computer hardware and software;\n\u2022\ndiversion of sales from our stores;\n\u2022\nliability for online content;\n\u2022\nlack of compliance with, or violations of, applicable state or federal laws and regulations, which could lead to litigation or regulatory investigations as well as impact consumer demand for our products;\n\u2022\nincreased or unfavorable governmental regulation of eCommerce (which may include regulation of privacy, data protection, eCommerce payment services, content, accessibility and other related subjects);\n\u2022\ncredit card fraud;\n\u2022\nsystem failures or disruptions and security breaches and the costs to address and remedy such failures, disruptions or breaches;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient levels of inventory of product or sizes to meet online demand; and\n\u2022\nuntimely delivery of our merchandise to our customers by third parties.\nIf we fail to successfully address and respond to these risks, it could damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. There also can be no assurance that our eCommerce operations will meet our sales and profitability plans, and the failure to do so also could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.\nCosts of raw materials, commodities, transportation or labor may rise resulting in an increase in component and delivery costs, and overall product costs, all of which could erode margins and impact our profitability.\nThe raw materials and labor used to manufacture our products, and our transportation and contract manufacturing labor costs are subject to availability constraints and price volatility. The results of our business operations could suffer due to significant increases or volatility in the prices of certain commodities, including but not limited to cotton, polyester and other items used in the production of our apparel and accessories, as well as fuel, oil and natural gas. Price increases of these items or other inflationary pressures may result in significant cost increases for our raw materials, product components and finished products, as well as increases in the cost of distributing merchandise to our retail locations. Consequently, higher product costs as a result of one or more of these factors could have a negative effect on our gross profits, as we may not be able to pass such costs on to our customers.\nOur reliance on foreign sources of production poses various risks.\nFor the last fiscal year, we directly imported approximately 36% of our merchandise, and much of the merchandise we purchase domestically is made overseas. Substantially all of our directly imported merchandise is manufactured in Asia.\nBecause a significant portion of our merchandise is produced overseas, we are subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:\n\u2022\ndelays in the delivery of cargo;\n\u2022\nimposition of, or increases in, duties, taxes or other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nnew legislation or regulations relating to increased tariffs, import quotas, embargoes, customs or other trade restrictions that may limit or prohibit merchandise that may be imported into the United States from countries or regions where we do business, increase the cost or reduce the supply of the merchandise we purchase or limit our ability to source products from countries that have the labor and expertise to manufacture our products cost effectively;\n\u2022\nfinancial or political instability in any of the countries in which our merchandise is manufactured;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies or restrictions on the transfer of funds, or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or foreign governments;\n\u2022\nsupply chain security initiatives undertaken by the United States or foreign governments that delay or impede the delivery of imports and normal flow of product;\n\u2022\ndelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to the failure of suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations;\n\u2022\ndelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at United States or foreign ports;\n\u2022\npotential recalls or cancellations of orders for any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards;\n\u2022\ninability to meet our production needs due to labor shortages; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, extreme weather, political or military conflicts, terrorism, disease epidemics and public health related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and embargoing or increased scrutiny (and the resulting delays) of goods produced in affected areas.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or a combination of them, could increase our costs or result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise, thereby negatively impacting sales, gross profit and operating income.\nIt is also possible that the inability of our suppliers to access credit may cause them to extend less favorable terms to us, which could adversely affect our cash flows, margins and financial condition. Additionally, delays by our vendors in supplying our inventory needs could cause us to incur more expensive transportation charges, which may adversely affect our margins.\nPotential changes in trade relations or tax changes related to the importation of goods could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our goods are imported, with China representing the largest supplier of such imported goods. President Trump has expressed a dislike for certain international trade agreements, indicated a willingness to reduce trade with China and/or impose higher tariffs on products imported from China and has also discussed changes in our tax code. It is possible the United States may impose new trade or other initiatives that adversely affect the trading status of countries where our apparel is manufactured and such initiatives could include retaliatory duties, higher tariffs or other trade sanctions that, if enacted, would increase the cost of products imported from countries where our suppliers manufacture merchandise. As a result, such goods may no longer be affordable at a commercially attractive price which could result in our seeking new suppliers in countries with which we have little or no experience. It is also possible the United States may change the tax laws relating to imported goods. One or more of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our merchandise is ordered through a small number of suppliers and our business could suffer if we needed to replace them.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead we depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. For the most recently completed fiscal year, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 73% of the merchandise we purchased, and we purchased 28% and 9% of our goods respectively from our two largest suppliers.\nWe generally maintain non-exclusive relationships with the suppliers that manufacture our merchandise, and we compete with other companies for production facilities. As a result, we have no contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing, and any supplier, including our key suppliers, could discontinue selling to us at any time. Moreover, a key supplier may not be able to supply our inventory needs due to capacity constraints, financial instability or other factors beyond our control, or we could decide to stop using a supplier due to quality or other performance or cost issues. If we determined to cease doing business with one or more of our key suppliers or if a key supplier were unable to supply desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, we could experience delays in the receipt of inventory until alternative supply arrangements were secured; such delays could result in lost sales and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nIf third parties with whom we do business do not adequately perform, or are unable or unwilling to perform, their functions, we might experience disruptions in our business, resulting in decreased profits, or losses, and damage to our reputation.\nWe depend upon independent third parties, both domestic and foreign, for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell. The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to us. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course.\nAdverse economic, industry or market conditions could result in an increased risk to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. Failure by any of these third parties to perform these functions effectively, properly and timely, or any disruption in our business relationships with any of these third parties, could negatively impact our operations, profitability and reputation.\nOur business and reputation could suffer if one or more of our suppliers or the factories they use fails to comply with applicable laws or to follow acceptable labor practices, or is accused of such non-compliance.\nOur success depends, in part, on the suppliers of our goods and the factories that they use to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to comply with our vendor code of conduct. Although each of our purchase orders requires adherence to accepted labor practices, applicable laws and compliance with our vendor code of conduct, we do not supervise or control our suppliers or the factories that produce the merchandise we sell. We rely on the staff of third-party auditing services to periodically visit and inspect the operations of a number of our independent factories to, among other things, assess compliance with our vendor code of conduct. Nonetheless, we cannot ensure that these factories will conduct their businesses in compliance with these expectations. Moreover, apparel companies can, in some cases, be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the suppliers of their products. In addition, we cannot control the public\u2019s perceptions of such suppliers or factories, even if they are compliant with applicable law but are nonetheless viewed in a negative light by the public. Their failure to comply with our vendor code of conduct or otherwise avoid creating negative consumer perceptions about their manufacturing methods and environment, could damage our reputation, interrupt or disrupt the shipment of products, result in a decrease in customer traffic to our stores or website and adversely affect our sales and operating income.\nThere are risks relating to the transportation of our merchandise to our distribution center, to our eCommerce fulfillment center, to our stores, and to our eCommerce customers.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments, including shipments to our distribution center, our stores, our eCommerce fulfillment center and our eCommerce customers. Our use of outside delivery services for shipments is subject to a variety of risks which may impact a shipper's ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely impact deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such a change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the independent third-party transportation providers we currently use, which would increase our costs.\nIn addition, because the vast majority of our products are shipped by ocean from overseas, there are risks associated with a disruption in the operation of ports through which our products are shipped. If a disruption in a port\u2019s operations occurs, we are likely to experience delays in the receipt of products, and we or our suppliers may have to find alternative shipping methods, possibly at greater expense, increased lead times and increased costs of our goods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. As a large part of our merchandise is produced in Asia, it is largely shipped to us through the ports on the West Coast. Any disruption in the operation of the West Coast ports could lead to the delayed receipt of merchandise and adjustments in our marketing promotions as a result. Any such delays could result in lost sales and lower gross margins due to the lack of seasonality of the product at time of receipt, and thus adversely affect our results of operations, gross profit and cash flows.\nInstability in the shipping industry could increase our costs, result in delays in the receipt or loss of merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2016, the seventh largest deep sea cargo transportation carrier filed for court receivership. This had a variety of repercussions throughout the shipping industry including increases in shipping costs and reduced overall capacity of available shipping containers and a temporary disruption in the flow of goods. While we do not rely on a single ocean carrier company to transport our goods, further disruption or instability among transportation carriers could result in reduced capacity, increased rates, delay in the receipt of or the loss of goods. This, in turn, could increase our costs, result in lost sales or sales at lower margins negatively impacting our brand, overall sales and our financial results.\nWe depend on a single facility to conduct our operations and distribute our merchandise. Our business could suffer a material adverse effect if this facility were shut down or its operations severely disrupted.\nOur corporate headquarters, data center and our only distribution facility are located in one facility in Plymouth, Minnesota. Our distribution facility supplies merchandise to our retail stores and our third party eCommerce fulfillment center. Any serious disruption to our distribution facility or a facility closure for any reason, could delay shipments to stores and our eCommerce fulfillment center and result in inventory shortages which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations. In addition, our main data center and all of our senior management, including critical resources dedicated to merchandising, operations, marketing, finance and administrative functions, are located at our corporate headquarters. In the event of a disaster or other calamity impacting our corporate facility or data center, our management and staff would have to find and operate out of other suitable locations and/or rely on alternative sources for computer, telecommunications and data storage systems. We have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate office and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business, personnel and results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that any insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us if our distribution center or corporate office were shut down for any unplanned reason.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges.\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nAdverse and/or unseasonable weather conditions in the United States could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. For example, inclement weather conditions can make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and/or result in temporary store closures or reduced hours of operation. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our merchandise offerings incompatible with those unseasonable conditions in the affected areas. Such unseasonable weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or other catastrophes could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, disruptive global political events, or similar catastrophes could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. To the extent these events result in the closure of our distribution center, corporate headquarters, or a significant number of our stores, or impact one or more of our key third-party providers of services or goods, our operations and financial performance could be adversely affected. These events also could have indirect consequences, such as loss of property or other damage which may or may not be covered by insurance.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and our ability to maintain and upgrade these systems from time-to-time and operate them in a secure manner. Any failure, interruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our information technology systems (\u201cIT systems\u201d). In particular, we rely on point-of-sale terminals, which provide information to our host analysis systems used to track sales and inventory, we rely on our eCommerce website through which we sell merchandise to our customers and we rely on a third party to process payroll for our employees. Although our data is backed up and securely stored off-site, our main data center is located at our headquarters in Plymouth, Minnesota. The data center and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption due to a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nfire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ngenerator loss, computer systems failures, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees and similar events;\n\u2022\nphysical and electronic loss of data or security breaches; and\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses or software bugs.\nAny disruption in the operation of our IT systems, the loss of key employees knowledgeable about such systems or our failure to continue to effectively enhance such systems could interrupt our operations resulting in the temporary loss of or ability to access data or interfere with our ability to sell goods in-store, which could result in reduced sales and affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, any interruption in the operation of our website could cause us to lose sales due to the temporary inability of customers to purchase merchandise through our website.\nFrom time-to-time, we improve and upgrade our IT systems and the functionality of our Internet website in an effort to ensure they meet our evolving business and security needs and are adequate to handle business growth. The cost of any such system upgrades or enhancements can be significant. In fiscal 2016, we made significant investments in our omni-channel capabilities, including the roll out of a new point-of-sale system and the launch of a new eCommerce website. If we are unable to effectively maintain, operate and secure this upgraded operating system and eCommerce website, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. While we believe that we are diligent in selecting vendors, systems and third party providers to assist us in maintaining the integrity of our information technology systems, we realize that there are risks and no assurance can be provided that future disruptions, service outages and failures or unauthorized intrusions will not occur.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur additional expenses in order to mitigate such risks or in response to unauthorized access to our data. In addition, an incident in which we or our third party service providers fail to protect our customers' information against a security breach could result in costly government enforcement actions and monetary damages against us from private litigation. Such an incident could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Company and our third-party service providers, which manage portions of the Company\u2019s data, are subject to cyber security risks. The nature of our business involves the receipt and transmission, and in some cases storage by us or third parties on our behalf, of customers\u2019 personal information, shopping preferences and our customers\u2019 private label credit card information, in addition to employee information and the Company\u2019s financial and strategic data. The protection of our customers\u2019 data, as well as confidential Company data is vitally important to the Company. The Company and its third-party service providers employ systems and/or websites that are intended to protect the storage and/or transmission of proprietary or confidential information by us and these third-party service providers. While the Company has implemented measures to prevent and detect security breaches and cyber incidents and to monitor its computer network, any failure of these measures and any failure of third parties that assist the Company in managing its data could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company expects our third-party service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures to protect the proprietary and confidential information once it is received by them, we cannot control these service providers and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or degrade storage service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we and the service providers we use may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties acting on our behalf, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees or those of our third-party providers. Despite our preventative efforts and those of our third-party service providers, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, privacy or denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events which could expose us and our third-party service providers to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary and confidential information, litigation and potential liability. Cyber security attacks may be targeted at us, our third-party service providers, or our customers. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant additional expense, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Any cyber security or security breaches, including any breaches that result in theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or company information, or our lack of compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, may result in significant legal and financial exposure, including claims for unauthorized purchases with stolen credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, and considerable other additional expenses. Some or all of these costs may not be adequately covered by our insurance, and could result in a loss of confidence in our security measures, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, business and reputation.\nConsumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is prevalent. Any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us or our service providers, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. Should customers lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, they may discontinue shopping in our stores or on our website.\nLaws on privacy continue to evolve and further limits on how we collect or use customer information could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect and store customer information primarily for marketing purposes and to improve our operations and the services we provide. The use or retention of certain information is subject to applicable privacy laws. These laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are evolving on a frequent basis. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to fines or penalties, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any compromise of customer information could subject us to customer, third-party or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Any limitations imposed on the use of such customer information by federal, state or local governments, could have an adverse effect on our future marketing activities. Governmental focus on data security and/or privacy may lead to additional legislative action, and the increased emphasis on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security. As a result, we may have to modify our business with the goal of further improving data security, which would result in increased expenses and operating complexity.\nA failure to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the use of credit and debit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our eCommerce website, and because of such use are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI Standards\u201d). If we or our business partners fail to comply with the PCI Standards or to adequately protect sensitive customer information, we may become subject to fines or limitations on our ability to accept credit or debit cards, which could adversely affect our sales, operating income, brand and reputation. Also, any changes we may be required to make to our private label credit card program in the future could adversely affect the promotional financing arrangements available to our credit card customers and therefore our operating results.\nThe sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors.\nThe sufficiency and availability of our sources of liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) the level of our operating cash flows, which are impacted by consumer acceptance of our merchandise, general economic conditions and the level of consumer discretionary spending; and (ii) our ability to maintain borrowing availability and to comply with applicable covenants contained in our Credit Facility.\nOur ability to return to profitability and to generate positive cash flows is dependent upon many factors, including favorable economic conditions and consumer confidence and our ability to successfully execute our financial plan and strategic and tactical initiatives. There can be no assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient at all times to support our Company without additional financing or credit availability. An inability to generate sufficient cash flow could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money or to invest in our business operations;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to open new stores, improve existing stores or convert stores to the MPW format; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to incur significant additional indebtedness.\nShould we be unable in the future to borrow under the Credit Facility, it is possible, depending on the cause of our inability to borrow, that we may not have sufficient cash resources for our operations. If that were to occur, our liquidity would be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccess to additional financing from the capital markets may be limited.\nWhile we have availability under our Credit Facility to bolster our liquidity, we may need additional capital to fund our operations, particularly if our cash flows from operating activities were to decrease or if the Credit Facility were unavailable. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities in order to improve our liquidity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we borrow under our Credit Facility or incur other debt, our expenses will increase and we could be subject to additional restrictions that may limit our operating flexibility. Newly issued securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock. There is no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be more vulnerable to any future downturns in our business or the general economy. Future increases in interest rates or other tightening of the credit markets, or future turmoil in the financial markets, could make it more difficult for us to access funds, to refinance our indebtedness (if necessary), to enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or to obtain funding through the issuance of our securities.\nOur ability to maintain the value of our trademarks impacts our business and financial performance.\nWe believe that our \u201cchristopher & banks\u201d, \u201ccj banks\u201d and related trademarks are important to our success and we register a number of our trademarks in the United States in an effort to protect them. Even though we take actions to establish, register and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights, we cannot be sure that we will be successful or that others will not imitate or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure that others will not seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights. If we cannot adequately protect our existing and future trademarks or prevent infringement of them, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe may be subject to adverse outcomes in current or future litigation matters or regulatory proceedings which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.\nFrom time-to-time, we may be involved in litigation, regulatory actions and other claims against our business. There are also other types of claims that could be asserted against us based on litigation that has been asserted against others, particularly in the retail industry such as intellectual property infringement (as discussed below) customer and employment claims, including class action claims or lawsuits alleging violations of federal or state laws. These matters typically arise in the ordinary course of business but, in some cases, could also raise complex factual and legal issues requiring significant management time and, if determined to be adverse to the Company, could subject the Company to material liabilities.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing activity by companies which have acquired intellectual property rights, but do not practice those rights (sometimes referred to as \u201cpatent trolls\u201d), to engage in very broad licensing programs aimed at a large number of companies in a wide variety of businesses, or at retail companies specifically. These efforts typically involve proposing licenses in exchange for a payment of money and may also include the threat or actual initiation of litigation. Any such litigation can be costly to defend, even if unsubstantiated or invalid. It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, of such claims on our business and operations.\nAn unfavorable outcome in any such litigation, claims or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or our reputation. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings can be expensive and require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to them, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nChanges in accounting rules and regulations, or failures in our internal controls may cause us to inaccurately report our financial results or to fail to prevent fraud which could adversely affect our results of operations or market confidence in our reported financial information.\nChanges to and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations may occur in the future, as well as new accounting rules or regulations. Such changes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and monitored by management, who meet regularly with our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We devote significant resources to document, test, monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so; however, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing fraud. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls or to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover. We are entitled to certain other protective provisions under Delaware law.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of the Company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable by, among other things:\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022authorizing the Board to designate and issue \"blank check\" preferred stock;\n\u2022limiting persons who can call special meetings or the Board of Directors or stockholders;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a stockholders' meeting.\nWe may be subject to increased labor costs.\nOur retail store operations are subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, vacation, sick leave and overtime pay. If federal, state or local minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of any minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Similarly, if federal or state overtime regulations change, more of our employees may be entitled to overtime pay, which could also increase our labor costs. Increasingly states and local municipalities are enacting laws governing working conditions particularly in the areas of sick leave, vacation and work schedules. Complying with these laws in limited geographic areas adds increased cost and complexity. If such minimum wage and other labor laws prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.\nStock price volatility.\nOur stock price, like that of other retail companies, is subject to significant volatility due to many factors, including, but not limited to: general economic conditions, stock and credit market conditions, quarter- to-quarter variations in our actual or anticipated financial results, analysts\u2019 ratings and investor sentiment. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and which may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nFurthermore, we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this Report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with the guidance we have provided. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance\nor the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our Company due to proxy contests, shareholder proposals, media campaigns and other actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our current or future business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or potential changes to the composition of the Board of Directors or senior management may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability. Such perceptions may also make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified and experienced senior management and Board members. The uncertainties and potential disruptions resulting from stockholder actions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price.", "PERMNO": 77478, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CBKC"}
