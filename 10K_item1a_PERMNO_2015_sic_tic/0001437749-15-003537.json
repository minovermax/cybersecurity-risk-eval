Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenues and operating income could fluctuate significantly.\nOur revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter to quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations may result from, among other factors:\n\u25cf\nthe timing of FDA approvals we receive;\n\u25cf\nour ability to resolve the Form 483 observations and warning letter issued by the FDA and the effect of any product recalls or seizure, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, and suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals resulting therefrom;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of process validation for particular drug products;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of product launches, and market acceptance of such products launched;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the amount we spend to research, develop, acquire, license or promote new products;\n\u25cf\nthe outcome of our clinical trial programs;\n\u25cf\nserious or unexpected health or safety concerns with our products, the brand products we have genericized, or our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new products by others that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to maintain selling prices and gross margins on our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our policies regarding returns, rebates, allowances and chargebacks for our products;\n\u25cf\nthe outcome of our patent infringement litigation and other litigation matters and expenditures as a result of such litigation;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to comply with complex governmental regulations which deal with many aspects of our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in coverage and reimbursement policies of health plans and other health insurers, including changes to Medicare, Medicaid and similar state programs;\n\u25cf\nincreases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing and supply interruptions, including product rejections or recalls due to failure to comply with manufacturing specifications;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our license partner(s) to secure regulatory approval, gain market share, sales volume, and sales milestone levels;\n\u25cf\ntiming of revenue recognition related to our alliance and collaboration agreements;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of others; and\n\u25cf\nthe addition or loss of customers.\nAs an illustration, we earned significant revenues and gross profit from sales of our authorized generic Adderall XR\u00ae and fenofibrate products during fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014. With respect to our authorized generic Adderall XR\u00ae products, in June 2012, an unrelated pharmaceutical company received FDA approval for a competitor product to our authorized generic Adderall XR\u00ae products and began marketing this product. Further, we were dependent on another unrelated third-party pharmaceutical company to supply us with such products we market and sell through our Global Division. Our supply agreement with such third party for the supply of generic Adderall XR\u00ae products expired on September 30, 2014. Although we continue to market and sell generic Adderall XR\u00ae products that we have in inventory, we will not earn any future revenue from the sale of such products after we exhaust our inventory. With respect to our fenofibrate products, in October 2012, a competitor product to our fenofibrate capsule was approved for sale by the FDA. As a result of these competing products, we have experienced significant diminution of our sales revenue and gross profit from our generic Adderall XR\u00ae and fenofibrate products. In our branded products division, we earned significant revenues and gross profit from sales of our Impax-labeled Zomig\u00ae (zolmitriptan) tablet, orally disintegrating tablet and nasal spray formulation products that we began selling during the year ended December 31, 2012 pursuant our Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca. In May 2013, our exclusivity period for branded Zomig\u00ae tablets and orally disintegrating tablets expired and we experienced diminution of our sales revenue and gross profit from those products as a result of increased competition. We launched authorized generic versions of those products in the United States. We continue to commercialize the branded Zomig\u00ae nasal spray which has U.S. patents expiring as late as May 2021, which patents have been challenged by an ANDA filer seeking to market a generic to Zomig\u00ae nasal spray.\nAny further diminution of sales revenue and/or gross profit from such products or our other significant products due to existing or additional competition, product supply or any other reasons in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations in such periods.\nDue to the fluctuations in revenue and operating results discussed in greater detail below, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. We cannot predict with any certainty the timing or level of sales of our products in the future. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance and any full-year financial forecast should not be relied upon as a guarantee of future performance for that year or for any given quarter within that year. If our quarterly sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the value of our securities could decline substantially.\nWe have received a warning letter and Form 483 observations from the FDA. If we are unable to promptly correct the issues raised in the warning letter and/or Form 483 observations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn late May 2011, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to an on-site FDA inspection of our Hayward, California manufacturing facility citing deviations from current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing practices for finished pharmaceutical products and which establish requirements for manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards and controls. The FDA observations set forth in the warning letter related to sampling and testing of in-process materials and drug products, production record review, and our process for investigating the failure of certain manufacturing batches (or portions of batches) to meet specifications. During the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, the FDA conducted inspections of our Hayward manufacturing facility and at the conclusion of each inspection, we received a Form 483. The Form 483 issued during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 contained observations primarily relating to our Quality Control Laboratory and the Form 483 issued during the quarter ended March 31, 2013 contained several observations pertaining to the operations of the Hayward facility, three of which were designated by the FDA as repeat observations from inspections that occurred prior to the warning letter. We provided the FDA with what we believe to be our complete written responses relating to the observations in the warning letter and the Form 483 issued in 2012. In connection with the Form 483 issued in 2013, we provided our written response and updates to the FDA regarding the completion status of our corrective actions. In late October 2013, at the FDA\u2019s request, we participated in a regulatory meeting with representatives of the FDA to provide additional information and clarifications on our response and updates related to the Form 483 issued in 2013. The FDA performed a re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility during June and July 2014. At the conclusion of the re-inspection, the FDA issued a Form 483 with seven inspectional observations, two of which were designated by the FDA as repeat observations from the inspection that occurred in 2013. We provided the FDA with what we believe to be our complete written response and updates regarding the completion status of our corrective actions through December 2014. To date, we have not been informed by the FDA as to whether a satisfactory re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility will be required to close out the warning letter and resolve the 2014 Form 483 observations on our Hayward manufacturing facility.\nIn July 2014, the FDA conducted an inspection of our Taiwan manufacturing facility and at the conclusion of the inspection, we received a Form 483 with ten observations. At the time of the inspections, the FDA did not provide any status or classification to either the Form 483 observations on our Hayward or Taiwan manufacturing facilities and, pursuant to its established regulatory process, would wait until they have received and reviewed our responses to classify those inspections. We received and responded to a request for additional information from the FDA regarding our Taiwan facility in December 2014. On January 7, 2015, we received approval from the FDA for the sale and marketing of RYTARY\u2122, our first internally developed branded product for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, which is manufactured in our Taiwan facility.\nTo date, the FDA has not notified us of any additional enforcement actions at either the Hayward or Taiwan manufacturing facilities; however, no assurance can be given as to whether the FDA will take any further actions. We are currently cooperating with the FDA to close out the warning letter and resolve the Form 483 observations. The warning letter and Form 483 observations do not currently place restrictions on our ability to manufacture and ship our existing products.\nWe have taken a number of steps to review our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards and are working with third-party experts to assist us with our review and in enhancing such systems and standards. This work is ongoing and we are committed to improving our quality control and manufacturing practices. We cannot be assured, however, that the FDA will be satisfied with our corrective actions and as such, we cannot be assured of when the warning letter will be closed out. Unless and until the warning letter is closed out and the Form 483 observations resolved, it is possible we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA as a result of current or future FDA observations, including, among others, monetary sanctions or penalties, product recalls or seizure, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, and suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals. Additionally, the FDA has withheld and may continue to withhold approval of pending drug applications listing our Hayward, California facility as a manufacturing location of finished dosage forms until the warning letter is closed out and the Form 483 observations on our Hayward facility are resolved. Further, other federal agencies, our customers and partners in our alliance, development, collaboration and other partnership agreements with respect to our products and services may take the warning letter and Form 483 observations into account when considering the award of contracts or the continuation or extension of such partnership agreements. If we are unable promptly to correct the issues raised in the warning letter and Form 483 observations, our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur continued growth is dependent on our ability to continue to successfully develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner.\nOur financial results depend upon our ability to introduce and commercialize additional generic and branded products in a timely manner. In the generic pharmaceutical products market, revenue from newly launched generic products that we are the first to market is typically relatively high during the period immediately following launch and can be expected generally to decline over time. Revenue from generic drugs in general can also be expected to decline over time. Revenue from branded pharmaceutical products can be expected to decline as the result of entry of new competitors, particularly of companies producing generic versions of the branded products. Our continued growth is therefore dependent upon our ability to continue to successfully introduce and commercialize new generic and branded products. As of February 6, 2015, we had 21 product applications pending at the FDA for generic versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals. In our branded products division, we have one internally developed branded pharmaceutical product, RYTARY\u2122, an extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa, for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and/or manganese intoxication that was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015. We also have a number of other product candidates that are in varying stages of development. The development and commercialization process for our products, particularly of our branded products, is time-consuming, costly and involves a high degree of business risk. The FDA and the regulatory authorities may not approve our products submitted to them or our other products under development. Additionally, we may not successfully complete our development efforts. Even if the FDA approves our products, we may not be able to market them successfully or profitably or, with respect to our generics products, we may not be able to market them at all if we do not prevail in the patent infringement litigation in which we are involved. Our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to timely develop, receive FDA approval for, and market new pharmaceutical products or otherwise acquire new products.\nA substantial portion of our total revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a limited number of customers. In 2014, our five major customers, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Amerisource-Bergen, CVS Caremark Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores accounted for 36%, 20%, 19%, 3% and 2%, respectively, or an aggregate of 80%, of our gross revenue.\nA reduction in, or loss of business with, any one of these customers, or any failure of a customer to pay us on a timely basis, would adversely affect our business.\nA substantial portion of our total revenues is derived from sales of a limited number of products.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of a limited number of products. In 2014, our top five products in our Global Division accounted for 15%, 8%, 6%, 6% and 6%, or an aggregate of 41%, of Global product sales, net. In our Impax Division, revenue from sales of branded Zomig\u00ae products pursuant to our Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca accounted for 100% of our Impax product sales, net. The sale of our products can be significantly influenced by market conditions, as well as regulatory actions. We may experience decreases in the sale of our products in the future as a result of actions taken by our competitors, such as price reductions, or as a result of regulatory actions related to our products or to competing products, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. Actions which could be taken by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, may include, without limitation, pricing changes and entering or exiting the market for specific products.\nSales of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our customer base.\nA significant proportion of our sales is made to relatively few retail drug chains, wholesalers, and managed care purchasing organizations. These customers are continuing to undergo significant consolidation. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products.\nOur net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, major distributors and other trade buyers, whether resulting from pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition, since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, or any delay in receiving payments from a single customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition from both brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing, and other resources than we have. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 customer base consists of an increasingly limited number of large pharmaceutical wholesalers, chain drug stores that warehouse products, mass merchandisers, mail order pharmacies. Our competitors may be able to develop products competitive with or more effective or less expensive than our own for many reasons, including that they may have:\n\u25cf\nproprietary processes or delivery systems;\n\u25cf\ngreater resources in the area of research and development and marketing;\n\u25cf\nlarger or more efficient production capabilities;\n\u25cf\nmore expertise in a particular therapeutic area;\n\u25cf\nmore expertise in preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nmore experience in obtaining required regulatory approvals, including FDA approval;\n\u25cf\nmore products; or\n\u25cf\nmore experience in developing new drugs and financial resources, particularly with regard to brand manufacturers.\nWith respect to generic pharmaceutical products, FDA approval of our ANDAs may be delayed if a branded pharmaceutical company files patent infringement suits that automatically delay FDA approval of generic products, or obtains new patents and brings new patent infringement suits. Further, the FDA approval process often results in the FDA granting final approval to a number of ANDAs for a given product at the time a patent for a corresponding brand product or other market exclusivity expires. This often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market. As competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies intensifies, selling prices and gross profit margins often decline, which has been our experience with our existing products. Moreover, with respect to products for which we file a Paragraph IV certification, if we are not the first ANDA filer challenging a listed patent for a product, we are at a significant disadvantage to the competitor that first filed an ANDA for that product containing such a challenge, which is awarded 180 days of market exclusivity for the product. With respect to our 12 publicly disclosed product applications pending FDA approval for which we have filed Paragraph IV certifications as of February 6, 2015, we believe we are first to file for some strengths of one product and not on other strengths of such product and unrelated third parties are the first to file with respect to the other 11 products. With respect to publicly disclosed products in which the applications are held by our third-party partners pursuant to alliance, development or collaboration agreements and for which Paragraph IV certifications have been filed, third parties unrelated to us or our partners are first to file with respect to one such product. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product that we develop is generally related to the number of competitors in that product\u2019s market and the timing of that product\u2019s regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Although we cannot assure, we strive to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to be competitive in our industry (see \u201cItem 1 Business - Regulation\u201d). Additionally, ANDA approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices and reduced margins for generic products compared to brand products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued price and margin erosion over the generic product life cycle.\nIn addition to the competition we face from other generic pharmaceutical companies, we face competition from brand-name pharmaceutical companies related to our generic products. Branded pharmaceutical companies often sell their branded products as \u201cauthorized generics\u201d (an industry term that describes instances when a brand-name manufacturer licenses a generic manufacturer to market the brand product under the licensee\u2019s name and registration at typical generic discounts).\nOur principal competitors in the generic pharmaceutical products market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Actavis, plc., Mylan Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., Lannett Company, Inc., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. and Sandoz.\nIn the brand-name pharmaceutical market, we market Impax-labeled branded Zomig\u00ae products pursuant to the AZ Agreement with AstraZeneca. In May 2013, our exclusivity period for branded Zomig\u00ae tablets and orally disintegrating tablets expired and we experienced diminution of our sales revenue and gross profit from those products as a result of increased competition. We launched authorized generic versions of both products in the United States in May 2013. We received approval from the FDA on January 7, 2015 to market and sell RYTARY\u2122, our first internally developed branded pharmaceutical product for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and we currently plan to fully launch our sales and marketing efforts for the product in early April 2015. We currently expect our principal competitors in the branded pharmaceutical market to include pharmaceutical companies that are focused on Parkinson\u2019s disease and other CNS disorders. In addition, with respect to products that we are developing internally and/or any additional products we may in-license from third parties, we expect that we will face increased competition from large pharmaceutical companies, other drug delivery companies, and other specialty pharmaceutical companies that have focused on CNS disorders.\nAny of the actions by our competitors as described above may significantly impact sales of our generic and branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past, and our future profitability is uncertain.\nAlthough 2007 was our first profitable year, and we continued to record net income on an annual basis through and including 2014, we do not know whether our business will continue to be profitable or generate positive cash flow, and our ability to remain profitable or obtain positive cash flow is uncertain. To remain operational and profitable, we must, among other things:\n\u25cf\nobtain FDA approval of our products;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully launch and market new products;\n\u25cf\nprevail in patent infringement litigation in which we are involved;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to generate or obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms to fund our operations; and\n\u25cf\ncomply with the many complex governmental regulations that deal with virtually every aspect of our business activities.\nAny delays or unanticipated expenses in connection with the operation of our limited number of facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA substantial portion of our manufacturing capacity as well as our current production is attributable to our two manufacturing facilities located in Hayward, California and Taiwan and to certain third party suppliers. A significant disruption at any one of these facilities within our internal or third party supply chain, even on a short-term basis, whether due to an adverse quality or compliance observation, including a total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution by regulatory authorities, an act of God, civil or political unrest, or other events could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis and could, among other consequences, subject us to exposure to claims from customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe completed construction of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan, installed equipment, and received FDA approval during 2009. We initiated construction of an expansion to the facility later that year and have expanded the Taiwan facility in stages. As of May 2014, the second phase of the expansion was completed and the manufacturing equipment in the facility was qualified for their intended use. A major portion of the second phase of the expansion was dedicated to the production of RYTARY\u2122 for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, which was approved by the FDA on January 7, 2015. We completed transfer of a substantial portion of our Hayward, California production to the lower cost production site in Taiwan during 2013 to create capacity for future products being launched from the Hayward facility. We currently plan to continue increasing production at our Taiwan facility of tablets and capsules in support of transferred products and in preparation for the growth of RYTARY\u2122.\nWhile we have thus far not suffered any material delays, significant increases in estimated expenses or other material setbacks associated with the construction, expansion and operation of the manufacturing facility in Taiwan, we cannot assure that costs of production will be within our projections or that the expansion of the facility will ultimately result in profitable operations.\nOur business is subject to the economic, political, legal and other risks of maintaining facilities and conducting clinical trials in foreign countries.\nIn 2010, we commenced shipment of commercial product from our new manufacturing facility in Taiwan, and we plan to increase our commercial manufacturing operations in Taiwan in the future. In addition, certain clinical trials for our product candidates are conducted at multiple sites in Europe. These foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in maintaining operations and doing business abroad, such as economic and political destabilization, international conflicts, restrictive actions by foreign governments, expropriation or nationalization of property, changes in laws and regulations, changes in regulatory requirements, the difficulty of effectively managing diverse global operations, adverse foreign tax or tariff laws, more limited intellectual property protection in certain foreign jurisdictions, and the threat posed by potential international disease pandemics in countries that do not have the resources necessary to deal with such outbreaks. Further, as our global operations require compliance with a complex set of foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, and export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. These foreign economic, political, legal and other risks could impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are routinely subject to patent litigation that can delay or prevent our commercialization of generic products or accelerate generic competition for our branded products and we may also become involved in other legal proceedings, all of which force us to incur substantial expense to defend and expose us to substantial liability.\nOur generic products division is routinely subject to patent infringement litigation brought by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking to delay FDA approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products. Likewise, our branded products division is currently involved in patent infringement litigation against a generic drug manufacturer seeking FDA approval to market its generic drug prior to patent expiration. Patent infringement litigation involves many complex technical and legal issues and its outcome is often difficult to predict, and the risk involved in doing so can be substantial. For generic product manufacturers, the potential consequences to such generic companies in the event of an unfavorable outcome include delaying generic launch until patent expiration and potential damages measured by the profits lost by the branded product manufacturer rather than the profits earned by the generic pharmaceutical company. For brand drug manufacturers, an unfavorable outcome may significantly accelerate generic competition ahead of patent expiration. Such litigation usually involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our products.\nAs of February 6, 2015, our generic products division was involved in one patent infringement suit involving oxymorphone hydrochloride. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred costs of approximately $2.9 million in connection with our participation in this matter, as well as for other matters that were resolved in 2014. If this or any of our future patent litigation matters are resolved unfavorably, we or any alliance or collaboration partners may be enjoined from manufacturing, developing or selling the product that is the subject of such litigation without a license from the other party. In addition, if we decide to market and sell generic products prior to the resolution of patent infringement suits, we could be held liable for lost profits if we are found to have infringed a valid patent, or liable for treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a valid patent. Although it is not currently possible to quantify the liability we could incur if any of these suits are decided against us, any patent litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of February 6, 2015, our branded products division was involved in one patent infringement suit involving Zomig\u00ae nasal spray. If this patent litigation matter is resolved unfavorably, our Zomig\u00ae nasal spray product may face generic competition significantly earlier than the date of patent expiration in May 2021.\nIn addition to patent infringement litigation claims, we are or may become a party to other litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, other intellectual property rights infringement, violations of securities laws, employment discrimination or breach of commercial contract. A detailed description of our significant legal proceedings are described in \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Note 19. Legal and Regulatory Matters.\u201d In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur agreements with brand pharmaceutical companies, which are important to our business, are facing increased government scrutiny in the U.S., which may result in increased government actions and private litigation suits.\nWe are involved in numerous patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies\u2019 listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic pharmaceutical products, as well as patent infringement litigation in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and/or their applicability to their generic pharmaceutical products, and therefore settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be an important part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S., including us, are required by law to file them with the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, some of the brand - generic settlement agreements violate the antitrust laws and has brought actions against some brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court in its decision in FTC v. Actavis determined that \u201creverse payment\u201d settlement agreements between brand and generic companies could violate antitrust laws. The Supreme Court held that such settlement agreements are neither immune from antitrust attack nor presumptively illegal but rather should be analyzed under the \u201cRule of Reason.\u201d It is currently uncertain the effect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will have on our existing settlement agreements or its impact on our ability to enter into such settlement agreements in the future or the terms thereof. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision may result in heightened scrutiny from the FTC of such settlement agreements and we may become subject to increased FTC investigations or enforcement actions arising from such settlement agreements. Further, private plaintiffs, including direct and indirect purchasers of our products, may also become more active in bringing private litigation claims against us and other brand and generic pharmaceutical companies alleging that such settlement agreements violate antitrust laws.\nIn May 2012, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (\u201cCID\u201d) from the FTC concerning its investigation into the drug SOLODYN\u00ae and its generic equivalents. According to the FTC, the investigation is to determine whether we, along with Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.) and six other companies, have engaged or are engaged in unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce by entering into agreements regarding SOLODYN\u00ae or its generic equivalents and/or engaging in other conduct regarding the sale or marketing of SOLODYN\u00ae or its generic equivalents. In February 2014, we received a CID from the FTC concerning its investigation into the drug Opana\u00ae ER and its generic equivalents. According to the FTC, the investigation relates to whether we and Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. have engaged or are engaged in unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce by (i) entering into agreements regarding Opana\u00ae ER or its generic equivalents and/or (ii) engaging in other conduct regarding the regulatory filings, sale or marketing of Opana\u00ae ER or its generic equivalents. To our knowledge, no proceedings by the FTC have been initiated against us at this time in either of the FTC\u2019s investigations into SOLODYN\u00ae and Opana\u00ae ER; however no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of these investigations.\nPrivate plaintiffs have also filed class action complaints against us and other manufacturers of SOLODYN\u00ae, Opana\u00ae ER and their respective generic equivalents. A detailed description of the SOLODYN\u00ae and Opana\u00ae ER FTC investigations and class action suits are described in \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Note 19. Legal and Regulatory Matters.\u201d The defense of antitrust litigation investigation and claims are generally expensive and time consuming, and we can give no assurance as to the timing or outcome of such investigation or claims or of any future private litigation or government action alleging that one of our settlement agreements violates antitrust laws.\nOur ability to develop or license, or otherwise acquire, and introduce new products on a timely basis in relation to our competitors\u2019 product introductions involves inherent risks and uncertainties.\nProduct development is inherently risky, especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established and the market is not yet proven. Likewise, product licensing involves inherent risks including uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones, as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to terms such as license scope or termination rights. The development and commercialization process, particularly with regard to new drugs, also requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The process of obtaining FDA approval to manufacture and market new pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly and largely unpredictable. We, or a partner, may not be successful in obtaining FDA approval or in commercializing any of the products that we are developing or licensing.\nOur approved products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe availability of alternative products from our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe prices of our products relative to those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of our market entry;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to market our products effectively at the retail level;\n\u25cf\nthe perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payers, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits of our drug products compared to those of competing products; and\n\u25cf\nthe acceptance of our products by government and private formularies.\nSome of these factors are not within our control, and our products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance. Additionally, continuing and increasingly sophisticated studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others which can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs such as the need for a patient registry.\nOur business is highly dependent on market perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. Our business or products could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket perceptions of our business are very important to us, especially market perceptions of the safety and quality of our products. If any of our products or similar products that other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because our business is dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, illness or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain existing products, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually evaluate the performance of our products, and may determine that it is in our best interest to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. For example, during 2013, we decided to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain products after we conducted a strategic review of our then currently manufactured generic product portfolio. We cannot guarantee that we have correctly forecasted, or will correctly forecast in the future, the appropriate products to discontinue or that our decision to discontinue various products is prudent if market conditions change. In addition, there are no assurances that the discontinuance of products will reduce our operating expenses or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such a decision. Furthermore, the discontinuance of existing products entails various risks, including, in the event that we decide to sell the discontinued product, the risk that we will not be able to find a purchaser for such products or that the purchase price obtained will not be equal to at least the book value of the net assets for such products. Other risks include managing the expectations of, and maintaining good relations with, our customers who previously purchased products from our discontinued products, which could prevent us from selling other products to them in the future. Moreover, we may incur other significant liabilities and costs associated with our discontinuance of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions or the recovery of our research and development expenditures.\nWe conduct research and development primarily to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with FDA regulations. We spent approximately $79.1 million, $68.9 million, $81.3 million on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We are required to obtain FDA approval before marketing our drug products. The FDA approval process is costly and time consuming. Typically, research expenses related to the development of innovative compounds and the filing of NDAs are significantly greater than those expenses associated with ANDAs. As we continue to develop new products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in our industry, our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.\nOur bioequivalence studies, other clinical studies and/or other data may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products. While we believe that the FDA\u2019s ANDA procedures will apply to our bioequivalent versions of branded drugs, these drugs may not be suitable for, or approved as part of, these abbreviated applications. In addition, even if our drug products are suitable for FDA approval by filing an ANDA, the abbreviated applications are costly and time consuming to complete. After we submit an NDA or ANDA, the FDA may require that we conduct additional studies, and as a result, we may be unable to reasonably determine the total research and development costs to develop a particular product. Also, for products pending approval, we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in anticipation of the product\u2019s launch. In the event that FDA approval is denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete. Finally, we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products or product-delivery technologies will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new products or new delivery technologies as a result of those efforts, we will be unable to recover those expenditures.\nThe time necessary to develop generic drugs may adversely affect whether, and the extent to which, we receive a return on our capital.\nWe generally begin our development activities for a new generic drug product several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the brand-name drug equivalent. The development process, including drug formulation, testing, and FDA review and approval, often takes three or more years. This process requires that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near-term return. Also, because of the significant time necessary to develop a product, the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly less than the originally projected market for the product. If this were to occur, our potential return on our investment in developing the product, if approved for marketing by the FDA, would be adversely affected and we may never receive a return on our investment in the product. It is also possible for the manufacturer of the brand-name product for which we are developing a generic drug to obtain approvals from the FDA to switch the brand-name drug from the prescription market to the OTC market. If this were to occur, we would be prohibited from marketing our product other than as an OTC drug, in which case revenues could be substantially less than we anticipated.\nResearch and development efforts invested in our branded pharmaceutical products may not achieve expected results.\nWe invest increasingly significant resources to develop our branded products, both through our own efforts and through collaborations, in-licensing and acquisition of products from or with third parties. The development of proprietary branded drugs involves processes and expertise different from those used in the development of generic products, which increases the risks of failure that we face. For example, the time from discovery to commercial launch of a branded product can be 15 years or even longer, and involves multiple stages: not only intensive preclinical and clinical testing, but also highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval processes which can vary from country to country. The longer it takes to develop a product, the longer time it may take for us to recover our development costs and generate profits, if at all.\nDuring each development stage, we may encounter obstacles that delay the process or approval and increase expenses, leading to significant risks that we will not achieve our goals and may be forced to abandon a potential product in which we have invested substantial amounts of time and money. These obstacles may include: preclinical failures; difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials; delays in completing formulation and other work needed to support an application for approval; adverse reactions or other safety concerns arising during clinical testing; insufficient clinical trial data to support the safety or efficacy of the product candidate; and failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the facilities in which it is manufactured. For instance, during 2013, we discontinued our branded pharmaceutical development programs for the potential treatment of moderate to severe Restless Leg Syndrome (\u201cRLS\u201d) after the results from the study did not achieve the statistical criteria for its primary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo and our program for the potential treatment of epilepsy as a result of technical and competitive factors. As a result of the obstacles noted above, our investment in research and development of branded products can involve significant costs with no assurances of future revenues or profits.\nApprovals for our new generic drug products may be delayed or become more difficult to obtain if the FDA institutes changes to its approval requirements.\nThe FDA may institute changes to its ANDA approval requirements, which may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain approval for our new generic products. For instance, in July 2012, the Generic Drug Fee User Amendments of 2012 (\u201cGDUFA\u201d) was enacted into law. The GDUFA legislation implemented fees for new ANDAs, Drug Master Files, product and establishment fees and a one-time fee for back-logged ANDAs pending approval as of October 1, 2012. In return, the program is intended to provide faster and more predictable ANDA reviews by the FDA and increased inspections of drug facilities. Under GDUFA, generic product companies face significant penalties for failure to pay the new user fees, including rendering an ANDA not \u201csubstantially complete\u201d until the fee is paid. It is currently uncertain the effect the new fees and new review procedures will have on our ANDA process and business, however, any failure by us or our suppliers to pay the fees or to comply with the other provisions of GDFUA may impact or delay our ability to file ANDAs, obtain approvals for new generic products, generate revenues and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the implementation of new fees and review procedures by the FDA, the FDA may also implement other changes that may directly affect some of our ANDA filings pending approval from the FDA, such as changes to guidance from the FDA regarding bioequivalency requirements for particular drugs. Such changes may cause our development of such generic drugs to be significantly more difficult or result in delays in FDA approval or result in our decision to abandon or terminate certain projects. Any changes in FDA requirements may make it more difficult for us to file ANDAs or obtain approval of our ANDAs and generate revenues and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting clinical trials could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our own branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to our branded products which do not qualify for the FDA\u2019s abbreviated application procedures, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that these products are safe and effective for use. We have only limited experience in conducting and supervising clinical trials. The process of completing clinical trials and preparing an NDA may take several years and requires substantial resources. Our studies and filings may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products and, if the FDA grants approval, we cannot predict the timing of any approval. There are substantial filing fees for NDAs that are not refundable if FDA approval is not obtained.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials. The results of clinical trials may not be indicative of results that would be obtained from large scale testing. Clinical trials are often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease and, as a result, during the course of treatment these patients can die or suffer adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agents being tested, but which nevertheless affect the clinical trial results. In addition, side effects experienced by the patients may cause delay of approval or limit the profile of an approved product. Moreover, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve certain products developed by us, there is no assurance that such regulatory authorities will not subject marketing of such products to certain limits on indicated use.\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and, in addition, the results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later and larger clinical trials, and product candidates in later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety or efficacy despite having progressed successfully through earlier clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in earlier clinical trials. For example, we had previously sought to develop an earlier product formulation containing carbidopa/levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Following completion of the clinical trials and submission of the NDA, the NDA was not approved due to the FDA\u2019s concerns over product nomenclature and the potential for medication errors. In early 2013, we discontinued our branded pharmaceutical development program for IPX159, an oral controlled-release formulation for the potential treatment of moderate to severe RLS, after the results from the clinical study in patients did not achieve the statistical criteria for its primary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo. In the future, the completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or halted for the reasons noted above in addition to many other reasons, including:\n\u25cf\ndelays in patient enrollment, and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nregulators or institutional review boards may not allow us to commence or continue a clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nour inability, or the inability of our partners, to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient to complete our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with trial design, which may result in a failure of the trial to show statistically significant results even if the product candidate is effective;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment commences, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u25cf\npoor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nsafety issues, including adverse events associated with product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of patients to complete clinical trials due to adverse side effects, dissatisfaction with the product candidate, or other reasons;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental or regulatory delays or changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; and\n\u25cf\nvarying interpretation of data by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, our product candidates could be subject to competition for clinical study sites and patients from other therapies under development which may delay the enrollment in or initiation of our clinical trials.\nThe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct unanticipated additional clinical trials, which could result in additional expense and delays in bringing our product candidates to market. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates would prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot assure that our expenses related to clinical trials will lead to the development of brand-name drugs that will generate revenues in the near future. Delays or failure in the development and commercialization of our own branded products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials and testing for our product candidates, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their legal and regulatory obligations, as well as their contractual obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe design the clinical trials for our product candidates, but rely on contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out these trials, including with respect to site selection, contract negotiation, analytical testing and data management. We do not control these third parties and, as a result, they may not treat our clinical studies as their highest priority, or in the manner in which we would prefer, which could result in delays.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and related activities, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices and good laboratory practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. The FDA enforces good clinical practices and good laboratory practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we, our contract research organizations or our study sites fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices and good laboratory practices, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with good clinical practices and good laboratory practices. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product manufactured under the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers if any are involved in the process, to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements. If our clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently do not have a license partner for commercialization of IPX066 outside of the United States.\nIn December 2010, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Glaxo Group Limited (\u201cGSK\u201d) whereby GSK received an exclusive license to develop and commercialize IPX066 (brand name RYTARY\u2122 in the United States) throughout the world, except in the United States and Taiwan, and certain follow-on products at the option of GSK. In April 2013, we announced with GSK that we were terminating our collaboration as a result of delays in the anticipated regulatory approval and launch dates in countries in which GSK had rights to commercialize the product and the License, Development and Commercialization Agreement was terminated. At the end of July 2013, GSK\u2019s rights to develop and commercialize IPX066 outside the United States and Taiwan were transferred back to us.\nIn November 2014, we submitted a Market Authorization Application (\u201cMAA\u201d) to the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) for IPX066, which was accepted for filing by the EMA later that month. We are, however, also seeking a license partner for the development and commercialization of IPX066 outside of the United States. No assurances, however, can be made that we will be able to receive regulatory approval from the EMA or that we will find a license partner for the development and commercialization of IPX066 outside of the United States. If we are unsuccessful in entering into a third party collaboration arrangement for the development and commercialization activities for IPX066 outside of the United States and/or are unable to satisfy our regulatory obligations with respect to IPX066 in such territories, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for IPX066 in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties could illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or no active pharmaceutical ingredients at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nReports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nPublic loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials that we use to manufacture our products and interruptions in our supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe typically purchase the ingredients, other materials and supplies that we use in the manufacturing of our products, as well as certain finished products, from a small number of foreign and domestic suppliers. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier or the supplier was not in compliance with FDA or other applicable requirements, the FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved. As a result, there is no guarantee we will always have timely and sufficient access to a required raw material or other product. In addition, some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Generally, we would need as much as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year\u2019s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. Further, a significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including:\n\u25cf\ngreater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems;\n\u25cf\nthe relative instability of some foreign governments and economies;\n\u25cf\ninterim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf\nuncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights.\nThose of our raw materials that are available from a limited number of suppliers include Bendroflumethiazide, Chloroquine, Colestipol, Digoxin, Fenofibrate, Methyltestosterone, Nadolol, Pyridostigmine and Klucel\u00ae, all of which are active pharmaceutical ingredients except Klucel\u00ae, which is an excipient used in several product formulations. The manufacturers of several of these products are sole-source suppliers. While none of the active ingredients is individually significant to our business, the excipient, which is not covered by a supply agreement, is utilized in a number of significant products. Only a couple of the active ingredients are covered by long-term supply agreements and, although we have to date only experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive uninterrupted or adequate supplies of such raw materials.\nMany third-party suppliers are subject to governmental regulation and, accordingly, we are dependent on the regulatory compliance of these third parties. We also depend on the strength, enforceability and terms of our various contracts with these third-party suppliers. We also rely on complex shipping arrangements throughout the various facilities of our supply chain spectrum. Customs clearance and shipping by land, air or sea routes rely on and may be affected by factors that are not in our full control or are hard to predict.\nAny inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases which cannot be passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur policies regarding returns, rebates, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods.\nBased on industry practice, generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post-sale inventory allowances. Under these arrangements, from time to time, we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing. Therefore, if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products, we would likely reduce the price of our product. As a result, we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products, which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided. Like our competitors, we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies or other customers. A chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler\u2019s end-customer pays for a product. Although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods, we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns, rebates, allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates.\nCertain of our products use controlled substances, the availability of which may be limited by the DEA and other regulatory agencies.\nWe utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development and therefore must meet the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the DEA in the United States. These laws relate to the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the active ingredients used in certain of our current products and products in development and, as a result, our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. We must annually apply to the DEA for procurement quota in order to obtain these substances. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnstable economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global economy has undergone a period of significant volatility which has led to diminished credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and increases in unemployment rates. There remains caution about the stability of the U.S. economy due to the global financial crisis, and we cannot assure that further deterioration in the financial markets will not occur. These economic conditions have resulted in, and could lead to further, reduced consumer spending related to healthcare in general and pharmaceutical products in particular.\nIn addition, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including our partners under our alliance and collaboration agreements, suppliers of raw chemical materials, drug wholesalers and other customers that may be affected by an unstable economic environment. Any economic instability may affect these parties\u2019 ability to fulfill their respective contractual obligations to us, cause them to limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us or drive us and our competitors to decrease prices, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility. Disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding. In the event current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions and the general availability of credit. Future debt financing may not be available to us when required or may not be available on acceptable terms, and as a result we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information. Any of these events could result in the loss of key information, impair our production and supply chain processes, harm our competitive position, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus, patches, data encryption, log monitors, routine back-ups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events.\nWe may be adversely affected by alliance, collaboration, supply, or license and distribution agreements we enter into with other companies.\nWe have entered into several alliance, collaboration, supply or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future. These arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us. Relationships with alliance partners may also include risks due to regulatory requirements, incomplete marketplace information, inventories, and commercial strategies of our partners, and our agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes. If we or our partners are not successful in commercializing the products covered by the agreements, such commercial failure could adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to license and distribution agreements with unrelated third party pharmaceutical companies, we are dependent on such companies to supply us with product that we market and sell, and we may enter into similar agreements in the future. Any delay or interruption in the supply of product under such agreements could curtail or delay our product shipment and adversely affect our revenues, as well as jeopardize our relationships with our customers.\nFrom time to time we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market our products may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on qualified scientific and technical employees and are increasingly dependent on our direct sales force, and our limited resources may make it more difficult to attract and retain these personnel.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. We are not aware of any pending, significant losses of scientific or technical personnel. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key scientific and technical personnel, however, would be significantly detrimental to our product-development programs. As a result of our small size and limited financial and other resources, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and qualified scientific and technical personnel.\nIn addition, marketing of the Zomig\u00ae products pursuant to our AZ Agreement with AstraZeneca and future marketing of our internally developed branded products approved by the FDA, including RYTARY\u2122, requires and will continue to require much greater use of a direct sales force compared to marketing of our Global products. Our ability to realize significant revenues from marketing and sales activities depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense. Any failure to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or to enter into third party arrangements on favorable terms for a contract sales force could negatively impact our sales revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees. Under the employment agreements, the employee may terminate his or her employment upon 60 days prior written notice to us. All of our other key personnel are employed on an at-will basis with no formal employment agreements. We do not maintain \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on any executives.\nWe are subject to significant costs and uncertainties related to compliance with the extensive regulations that govern the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products as well as environmental, safety and health regulations.\nThe manufacturing, distribution, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and advertising of our products are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies, including the FDA, DEA, FTC, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Environmental Protection Agency, among others. We are also subject to state and local laws, regulations and agencies in California, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as well as the laws and regulations of Taiwan. Such regulations are also subject to change by the relevant federal, state and international agencies. For instance, beginning on January 1, 2015, manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers of certain prescription drugs must provide and capture certain product tracing information under the Drug Quality and Security Act (\u201cDQSA\u201d). Title II of the DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, requires companies in certain prescription drugs\u2019 chain of distribution to build electronic, interoperable systems to identify and trace the products as they are distributed in the United States. Compliance with the DQSA or any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase the Company's operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. Compliance with other federal and state and local law regulations, including compliance with any newly enacted regulations, requires substantial expenditures of time, money and effort to ensure full technical compliance. Failure to comply with the FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, exposure to product liability claims, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, suspension of the FDA\u2019s review of NDAs or ANDAs, enforcement actions, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution.\nAs discussed above, we received a warning letter in late May 2011 from the FDA related to an on-site FDA inspection of our Hayward, California manufacturing facility citing deviations from cGMP. During 2012, 2013 and 2014, the FDA conducted inspections of our Hayward manufacturing facility and at the conclusion of each inspection, we received a Form 483. In July 2014, the FDA conducted an inspection of our Taiwan manufacturing facility and at the conclusion of the inspection, we received a Form 483 with ten observations. We have taken a number of steps to review our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards and are working with third-party experts to assist us with our review and in enhancing such systems and standards. We cannot be assured, however, that the FDA will be satisfied with our corrective actions and as such, we cannot be assured of when the warning letter will be closed out. Unless and until the warning letter is closed out and the Form 483 observations resolved, it is possible we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA as a result of the current or future FDA observations, including, among others, monetary sanctions or penalties, product recalls or seizure, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, and suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals. Additionally, the FDA has withheld and may continue to withhold approval of pending drug applications currently or previously listing our Hayward, California facility as a manufacturing location of finished dosage forms until the warning letter is closed out and the Form 483 observations on our Hayward facility are resolved. Further, other federal agencies, our customers and partners in our alliance, development, collaboration and other partnership agreements with respect to our products and services may take the warning letter and the Form 483 observations into account when considering the award of contracts or the continuation or extension of such partnership agreements. Any such actions could significantly disrupt our business and harm our reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect, to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations, we cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that we may be required to make in order to comply with such laws as they apply to our operations and facilities. We are also subject to potential liability for the remediation of contamination associated with both present and past hazardous waste generation, handling, and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by environmental, safety, and health regulatory agencies. Environmental laws are subject to change and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and face larger capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws.\nWe may experience reductions in the levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products by governmental authorities, HMOs or other third-party payers. Any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious governmental authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs, provide reimbursement to consumers for the cost of certain pharmaceutical products. Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which such reimbursement is available. In addition, third-party payers are attempting to control costs by limiting the level of reimbursement for medical products, including pharmaceuticals, and increasingly challenge the pricing of these products which may adversely affect the pricing of our products. Moreover, health care reform has been, and is expected to continue to be, an area of national and state focus, which could result in the adoption of measures that could adversely affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals or the amount of reimbursement available from third-party payers for our products.\nReporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other government programs are complex, and failure to comply could result in sanctions and penalties or we could be required to reimburse the government for underpayments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMedicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and somewhat ambiguous. State attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice have brought suits or instituted investigations against a number of other pharmaceutical companies for failure to comply with Medicaid and other government reporting obligations. Our methodologies for making these calculations are complex and the judgments involved require us to make subjective decisions, such that these calculations are subject to the risk of errors. Government agencies may impose civil or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. Any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative or regulatory programs that may influence prices of prescription drugs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCurrent or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, prescription drug prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by certain state attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice. Decreases in health care reimbursements or prices of our prescription drugs could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements governing the healthcare industry may result in substantial fines, sanctions and restrictions on our business activities.\nOur practices and activities related to the sales and marketing of our products, as well as the pricing of our products, are subject to extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state healthcare statutes and regulations intended to combat fraud and abuse to federal and state healthcare payment programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, Tri-Care, CHAMPUS, and Department of Defense programs. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and similar state laws and implementing regulations. For example, the payment of any incentive to a healthcare provider to induce the recommendation of our product or the purchase of our products reimbursable under a federal or state program is prohibited under these laws. Likewise, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to a federal or state health care program would expose a company to sanctions and penalties. Similarly, the inaccurate reporting of prices leading to inflated reimbursement rates would also be considered a violation of these laws. These laws and regulations are enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, state Medicaid Fraud Units and other state enforcement agencies.\nViolations of these laws and regulations are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including substantial fines and penal sanctions, such as imprisonment. It is common for enforcement agencies to initiate investigations into sales and marketing practices, as well as pricing practices, regardless of merit. These types of investigations and any related litigation can result in: (i) large expenditures of cash for legal fees, payment for penalties, and compliance activities; (ii) limitations on operations; (iii) diversion of management resources; (iv) injury to our reputation; and (v) decreased demand for our products.\nWhile we believe that our practices and activities related to sales and marketing, and the pricing of our products, are in compliance with these fraud and abuse laws, the criteria for compliance are often complex and subject to change and interpretation. An investigation by an enforcement agency could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into, and anticipate entering into, contracts with various U.S. government agencies. Unfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which may be customary, may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGovernment contracts customarily contain provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to:\n\u25cf\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency;\n\u25cf\nterminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u25cf\nreduce the scope and value of contracts;\n\u25cf\nchange certain terms and conditions in contracts;\n\u25cf\nclaim rights to products, including intellectual property, developed under the contract;\n\u25cf\ntake actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;\n\u25cf\ndirect the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;\n\u25cf\naudit and object to the contractor\u2019s contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and\n\u25cf\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of the contractor\u2019s products.\nGenerally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination.\nIf the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Some government contracts grant the government the right to use, for or on behalf of the U.S. government, any technologies developed by the contractor under the government contract. If we were to develop technology under a contract with such a provision, we might not be able to prohibit third parties, including our competitors, from using that technology in providing products and services to the government.\nAs a government contractor, we may also become subject to periodic audits and reviews. As part of any such audit or review, the government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, compensation and/or management information systems. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in the United States may harm our future business.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u201d (P.L. 111-148) and on March 30, 2010, the President signed the \"Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act\" (P.L. 111-152), collectively commonly referred to as the \u201cHealthcare Reform Act\u201d which, among other things, requires most individuals to have health insurance, effective January 1, 2014, establishes new regulations on health plans (with the earliest changes for certain benefits beginning with plan years commencing after September 23, 2010), creates insurance exchanges (effective January 2014) and imposes new requirements and changes in reimbursement or funding for healthcare providers, device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies (with the earliest changes effective on March 23, 2010) and other changes staged in thereafter. The Health Care Reform Act also added substantial new provisions affecting compliance, some of which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required, beginning from 2013, to comply with the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which was passed as part of the Health Care Reform Act and requires pharmaceutical companies to monitor and report payments, gifts, the provision of samples and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and teaching hospitals. The Healthcare Reform Act imposes additional requirements and obligations upon our company, which, to a certain extent, will depend upon the mix of products we sell. These changes include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrevisions to the Medicaid rebate program by: (a) increasing the rebate percentage for branded drugs and authorized generics dispensed after December 31, 2009 to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (\"AMP\"), with limited exceptions, (b) increasing the rebate for outpatient generic, multiple source drugs dispensed after December 31, 2009 to 13% of AMP; (c) changing the definition of AMP; and (d) extending the Medicaid rebate program effective January 1, 2011 to Medicaid managed care plans, with limited exception;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of annual fees upon manufacturers or importers of branded prescription drugs, which fees will be in amounts determined by the Secretary of Treasury based upon market share and other data;\n\u25cf\nproviding a 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions filled in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2011;\n\u25cf\nimposing increased penalties for the violation of fraud and abuse laws and funding for anti-fraud activities; and\n\u25cf\nexpands the definition of \u201ccovered entities\u201d that purchase certain outpatient drugs in the 340B Drug Pricing Program of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act.\nFurther, the Healthcare Reform Act also amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In particular, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. From time to time we may enter into business arrangements (e.g., loans or investments) involving our customers and those arrangements may be reviewed by federal and state regulators. Although we believe that we are in compliance, our practices may be determined to fail to meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.\nThe Healthcare Reform Act contemplates the promulgation of significant future regulatory action which may also further affect our business. The Act and any further changes to health care laws or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and our future success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property and not infringe on the rights of others.\nWe believe intellectual property protection is important to our business and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the rights of others. We cannot assure you that:\n\u25cf\nany of our future processes or products will be patentable;\n\u25cf\nour processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties; or\n\u25cf\nwe will have the resources to defend against charges of patent infringement by third parties or to protect our own rights against infringement by third parties.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge related to our products and technology which we generally seek to protect by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, licensees and pharmaceutical companies. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known by our competitors.\nWe are subject to potential product liability claims that can result in substantial litigation costs and liability.\nThe design, development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain, and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Although we currently carry $50.0 million of such insurance, we believe that no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all such risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceutical products for human consumption.\nWe face risks relating to our goodwill and intangibles.\nAt December 31, 2014, our goodwill, which was originally generated as a result of the December 1999 merger of Global Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was approximately $27.6 million, or approximately 3% of our total assets, and the carrying value of our intangible assets, composed primarily of the Zomig\u00ae , Actavis, Perrigo and Tolmar product rights acquired by us pursuant to agreements with the respective parties, was approximately $26.7 million, or approximately 2% of our total assets. We may never realize the value of our goodwill and intangibles. We regularly evaluate and will continue to regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred to indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary. During the three month period ended September 30, 2013, we recorded a $13.2 million impairment charge to cost of revenues for our Global Division as a result of deteriorating market conditions. During the same period in 2013, we also recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $0.8 million in research and development expenses as a result of a decision by management to withdraw one of our ANDAs and no longer seek FDA approval. The impairment charge represented the full carrying value of the ANDA. During the three month period ended March 31, 2014, as a result of a further decline in pricing, we revised our projections and performed an intangible asset impairment analysis. Based on the results of this analysis, we recorded a $2.9 million charge to cost of revenues for the Global Pharmaceuticals Division. Other than the impairment charges discussed above, as of December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was not impaired based on our assessment performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Further, any future acquisitions or investments in businesses could also result in an increase in goodwill, intangible assets and amortization expenses that could ultimately negatively impact our profitability. If the fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined at some future date to be less than its recorded value, a change to earnings may be required. Any such charge or future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax regulations and varying application and interpretations of these regulations could result in an increase in our existing and future tax liabilities.\nWe have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations, including exposures with respect to manufacturing, research and development, marketing, sales and distribution functions. Although our arrangements are based on accepted tax standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions including the United States may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed, which may increase our tax liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of our operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business will suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in the past several years and anticipate continued rapid expansion in the future. This growth has required us to expand, upgrade, and improve our administrative, operational, and management systems, internal controls and resources. We anticipate additional growth in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing operations, development of our brand-name products, and our marketing and sales efforts for the products we develop. Although we cannot assure you that we will, in fact, grow as we expect, if we fail to manage growth effectively or to develop a successful marketing approach, our business and financial results will be materially harmed. We may also seek to expand our business through complementary or strategic acquisitions of other businesses, products or assets, or through joint ventures, strategic agreements or other arrangements. Any such acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations may involve significant integration challenges, operational complexities and time consumption and require substantial resources and effort. It may also disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. Further, if we are unable to realize synergies or other benefits expected to result from any acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations, or to generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired, which would require us to focus additional resources on the integration of operations rather than other profitable areas of our business, and may otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may make acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary technologies, businesses or products, which may be on terms that are not commercially advantageous, may require additional debt or equity financing, and may involve numerous risks, including the risks that we may be unable to integrate the acquired business successfully and that we may assume liabilities that adversely affect us.\nWe regularly review the potential acquisition of technologies, products, product rights and complementary businesses. We may choose to enter into such transactions at any time. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates. To the extent that we do identify candidates that we believe to be suitable, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially advantageous terms or at all.\nIf we make any acquisitions or investments, we may finance such acquisitions or investments through our cash reserves, debt financing, or by issuing additional equity securities, which could dilute the holdings of our then-existing stockholders. If we require financing, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain required financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all. Any such acquisitions or investments could also result in an increase in goodwill, intangible assets and amortization expenses that could ultimately negatively impact our profitability. If the fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined at some future date to be less than its recorded value, a charge to earnings may be required. Further, our consolidated financial statements may also be impacted in future periods based on the accuracy of our valuations of any businesses we acquire. Such a charge to earnings or impact on our consolidated financial statements could be in amounts that are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in assimilating the personnel, operations and products of the acquired companies, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. There may be overlap between our products or customers and those of an acquired entity that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses. As a result of acquiring businesses, we may incur significant transaction costs, including substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and financial printing. Any acquisition could result in our assumption of unknown and/or unexpected, perhaps material liabilities. Additionally, in any acquisition agreement, the negotiated representations, warranties and agreements of the selling parties may not entirely protect us, and liabilities resulting from any breaches could exceed negotiated indemnity limitations.\nWe may not complete the proposed acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. (\u201cTower\u201d) and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. (\u201cLineage\u201d) within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn October 8, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we will acquire all the outstanding shares of common stock of Tower and Lineage, and the options and warrants to purchase or acquire shares of Tower common stock and shares of Lineage common stock will be cancelled, for a purchase price of $700 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments for working capital, net debt and transaction expenses. The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the accuracy of the representations and warranties, and performance of covenants. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, on January 2, 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated commitment letter (the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d), which amended and restated the commitment letter dated as of October 8, 2014, as first amended and restated on October 22, 2014 with Barclays Bank plc (\u201cBarclays\u201d), Royal Bank of Canada (\u201cRoyal Bank\u201d), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (\u201cWells Fargo Securities\u201d and together with Barclays, Royal Bank and Wells Fargo, the \u201cLenders\u201d) pursuant to which the Lenders have severally but not jointly committed to provide a $50.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $435.0 million senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $485.0 million for the purposes of financing the proposed acquisition of Tower and Lineage and the fees and expenses in connection therewith, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. The obligations of the Lenders to provide debt financing under the Commitment Letter is subject to a number of conditions, including (i) absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) that would result in a failure of a condition under the Stock Purchase Agreement, (ii) execution and delivery by us of definitive documentation with respect to the debt financing consistent with the term sheet attached to the Commitment Letter; (iii) the accuracy of certain specified representations and warranties in the debt documents; (iv) concurrent consummation of the proposed transaction in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement (v) delivery of certain customary closing documents (including, among others, a customary solvency certificate), specified items of collateral (where applicable) and certain Tower and Lineage financial statements; and (vi) payment of applicable costs, fees and expenses. The final termination date of the Commitment Letter is March 30, 2015.\nThe proposed transaction is also subject to other risks and uncertainties, such as the possibility that we do not satisfy the conditions to obtain the debt financing under the Commitment Letter or that either we or the Sellers (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) could exercise our respective termination rights. In the event that the transaction is not consummated or is materially delayed for any reason, we will have spent considerable time and resources and incurred substantial costs related to the acquisition, many of which must be paid even if the transaction is not completed. We cannot provide any assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the transaction. If the acquisition is not consummated, our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nFailure to consummate the acquisition of Tower and Lineage could negatively impact the share price of our common stock.\nIf the proposed acquisition of Tower and Lineage is not consummated, the stock price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected. Without realizing any of the benefits of having consummated the transactions, we will be subject to a number of risks, including that the current price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the proposed acquisition of Tower and Lineage will occur. A failure to complete the acquisition could therefore result in a material decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of Tower and Lineage into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the proposed acquisition.\nThe success of the proposed acquisition of Tower and Lineage, if completed, will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the operations of Tower and Lineage with our business in an efficient and effective manner. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects. Further, our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures.\nTower and Lineage will continue to operate independently of us until the closing of the transaction. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Tower and Lineage with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the proposed transaction, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any future changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used or necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement of our results.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. This involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.\nOur management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders and alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to retain our current, or obtain new, alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners.\nIn addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. Although we remedied any past accounting issues and do not believe similar accounting problems are likely to recur, an internal control material weakness may develop in the future and affect our ability to timely file our periodic reports. The inability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act could result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on any public market. This would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect our business.\nTerrorist attacks at or nearby our facilities in Hayward, California, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or our manufacturing facility in Taiwan may negatively affect our operations. While we do not believe that we are more susceptible to such attacks than other companies, such attacks could directly affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could make the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales.\nWe carry insurance coverage on our facilities of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general and the scope and cost of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. Currently, we carry terrorism insurance as part of our property and casualty and business interruption coverage. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged facilities, as well as the anticipated future net sales from those facilities.\nBecause of the location of our manufacturing and research and development facilities, our operations could be interrupted by an earthquake or be susceptible to climate changes.\nOur corporate headquarters in California, manufacturing operations in California and Taiwan, and research and development activities related to process technologies are located near major earthquake fault lines. Although we have other facilities, we produce a substantial portion of our products at our California facility. A disruption at these California facilities due to an earthquake, other natural disaster, or due to climate changes, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis. In addition, we could experience a destruction of facilities which would be costly to rebuild, or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe presently carry $10.0 million of earthquake coverage which covers all of our facilities on a worldwide basis. We carry an additional $40.0 million of earthquake coverage specifically for our California facilities. We believe the aggregate amount of earthquake coverage we currently carry is appropriate in light of the risks; however, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. We may discontinue some or all of this insurance coverage in the future if the cost of premiums exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged facilities, as well as the anticipated future net sales from those facilities.\nThe expansion of social media platforms present new risks and challenges, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could seriously damage our reputation. Further, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and protect information. If our non-public sensitive information is disclosed or if our reputation is seriously damaged through social media, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 82702, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "IPXL"}
