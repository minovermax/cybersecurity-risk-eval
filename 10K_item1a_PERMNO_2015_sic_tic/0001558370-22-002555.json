{"cik": "1346830", "company": "Cara Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risks should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects and an investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Development and Commercialization of Our Product and Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our product and product candidates. If we are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain additional regulatory approvals and commercialize our product and product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business depends on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product, KORSUVA injection, and product candidates. In August 2021, the FDA approved KORSUVA injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CKD-aP in adults undergoing hemodialysis. Our partner, VFMCRP, submitted an MAA to the EMA in March 2021, which was accepted for review by the EMA. If approved, KORSUVA injection would receive marketing authorization in all member states of the EU, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The EMA\u2019s decision on the EU MAA is expected in the second quarter of 2022; however, we cannot assure you that the results of our trials will successfully support the additional regulatory applications for approval. Our ability to generate product revenues in the near term is dependent on our and our commercial partners\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize KORSUVA injection. Although during the year ended December 31, 2021 we recognized commercial supply revenue of $0.7 million from the sale of KORSUVA injection to Vifor, we currently generate no revenues from sales of any products, and we may never be able to develop or successfully commercialize a marketable product.\nKORSUVA injection in the U.S. will require marketing efforts by our commercial partners before we generate any revenues from product sales. For example, we submitted required documents to CMS to ensure timely reimbursement and patient access to KORSUVA injection. Vifor Pharma Group submitted the application for a HCPCS reimbursement code and the payment reimbursement application for a TDAPA to CMS in September 2021. In December 2021, CMS granted TDAPA to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA will apply to KORSUVA injection beginning April 1, 2022 for two years. CMS expressed in its written communication to us and Vifor Pharma, a continuing interest in engaging with the companies regarding potential post-TDAPA support to ensure all beneficiaries with ESRD have access to innovative products such as KORSUVA injection. However, there is no assurance that KORSUVA injection will be able to maintain its price established in the TDAPA period in the post-TDAPA timeframe. If we and our commercial partners do not successfully commercialize KORSUVA injection, we will not be able to generate revenue from sales of any products in the United States in the foreseeable future, or at all. Any significant delays in commercializing KORSUVA injection will have a substantial adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nFurther, we cannot be certain that Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) or any future product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Regulatory authorities may interpret our data differently than we have. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nThe success of our products and product candidates depends on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials, as well as completion of preclinical studies\u037e\n\u25cf safety and favorable efficacy and acceptable safety data from our clinical trials and other studies\u037e\n\u25cf receipt of additional regulatory approvals\u037e\n\u25cf managing our reliance on sole-source third parties such as our third-party suppliers and manufacturers\u037e\n\u25cf the performance by CROs or other third parties we may retain of their duties to us in a manner that complies with our protocols and applicable laws and that protects the integrity of the resulting data\u037e\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity\u037e\n\u25cf ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the valid patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of third parties\u037e\n\u25cf successfully launching our product, such as KORSUVA injection, with our commercial partners, including market acceptance, and our other product candidates, if and when approved\u037e\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement from third-party payers for products and product candidates\u037e\n\u25cf competition with other products\u037e\n\u25cf post-marketing commitments, if any, to regulatory agencies following regulatory approval of our product candidates\u037e\n\u25cf continued acceptable safety profile following regulatory approval\u037e and\n\u25cf manufacturing or obtaining sufficient supplies of our products and product candidates that may be necessary for use in clinical trials for evaluation of our product candidates and commercialization of our products.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays in our ability to, or be unable to obtain additional regulatory approvals for, and/or to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates, which would materially harm our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe rely on third-party CROs to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials for all of our product candidates, and do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of any other potential product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business.\nOur reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with FDA\u2019s good laboratory practice, or GLP, as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected.\nRegulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced, under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nOur CROs may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical and preclinical programs. In addition, the operations of our CROs may be constrained or disrupted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our products and product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our products or product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our products and may lose potential revenues.\nWe do not manufacture KORSUVA injection or any of our product candidates, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our products for commercialization and product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. It is our intention that by the time of additional regulatory approvals for commercialization, we will have negotiated long-term commitments with at least one primary supplier for each manufacturing and distribution function. In July 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive commercial manufacturing agreement with Patheon for KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection and in July 2021, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Polypeptide Laboratories S.A., or PPL, for the KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection. Any problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product or product candidate may result in a delay in FDA approval of the product candidate or may impair our ability to manufacture commercial quantities, which would adversely affect our business. For example, our manufacturers will need to produce specific batches of our products and product candidates to demonstrate acceptable stability under various conditions and for commercially viable lengths of time. We and our contract manufacturers will need to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities this acceptable stability data for our products and product candidates, as well as validate methods and manufacturing processes, in order to receive and maintain regulatory approval to commercialize KORSUVA injection or any other product candidates. Furthermore, if our commercial manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished product on a timely\nbasis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the products and product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not perform as agreed. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide products for commercialization and product candidates to patients in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\nFurther, we may rely on proprietary technology developed by our contract manufacturers for purposes of manufacturing certain of our products and product candidates and our failure to negotiate or maintain the long-term use of any such proprietary technology or the inability for our contract manufacturers to produce our products and product candidates or components of our products and product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, may lead to delays or interruptions in the regulatory approval or commercialization process, as well as increased costs. For example, in August 2019, we entered into the Enteris License Agreement and intend to use Enteris\u2019s Peptelligence\u00ae technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin). If we experience any interruptions in the manufacture, delivery or scale-up of the Enteris formulation technology, we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin). Further, if we are unable to maintain our relationship with Enteris, we may be forced to reformulate Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) which could result in significantly delaying commercializing Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) and require us to incur additional costs in connection with such reformulation and potentially needed to seek additional approvals from the FDA. The operations of our third-party manufacturers have been and may in the future be constrained or disrupted and their operating capacity may be reduced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could negatively impact our clinical development and commercialization timelines.\nIn addition, all manufacturers of our products and product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products and product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, regulatory agencies subject an approved product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and inspections, including periodic unannounced inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with our current or any future approved products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where our current or any future approved products are manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of our current or any such future approved products, up to and including withdrawal of the affected product from the market. We have little control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products and product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products and product candidates, if approved. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension, delay or denial of product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nEven if we obtain additional regulatory approvals for our product candidates, they may never be successfully launched or become profitable, in which case our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be materially harmed.\nIn order to successfully launch our products and product candidates and have them become profitable, we anticipate that we will have to dedicate substantial time and resources. Our ability to generate revenues from our commercialized products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf achievement of broad market acceptance and coverage by third-party payers for our products;\n\u25cf our partners\u2019 effectiveness in marketing and selling our products;\n\u25cf our ability to have manufactured commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels and in compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain a cost-efficient organization and, to the extent we seek to do so, to collaborate successfully with additional third parties;\n\u25cf our ability to expand and maintain intellectual property protection for our products successfully;\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety of our products; and/or\n\u25cf our ability to comply with regulatory requirements, which are subject to change.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization efforts, we may not be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. A failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities, or if we are unable to enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our products and product candidates, if they are approved, we may be unable to generate product revenues.\nWe currently do not have an internal commercial infrastructure for the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize our product and product candidates (if approved), we must build our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make and maintain arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved in the building and managing of a commercial infrastructure to the extent we choose to do so in the future. The establishment and development of our own sales force and related plans to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability.\nIn August 2021, the FDA approved KORSUVA injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CKD-AP in adults undergoing hemodialysis in the U.S. We have entered into agreements with Vifor and VFMCRP to commercialize KORSUVA injection in the U.S. We are dependent on Vifor and VFMCRP to successfully commercialize KORSUVA injection with their own, or their collaborators\u2019, sales force. We have partnered with VFMCRP to commercialize KORSUVA worldwide (if and when approved), excluding Japan (Maruishi/sub-licensee Kissei), and South Korea (CKDP). We and Vifor began commercializing KORSUVA injection in the U.S. in December 2021 and we expect commercial launch of KORSUVA injection in April 2022 and associated revenues in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe, or our partners or collaborators, will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, manage and retain marketing and sales personnel. In the event that we or our partners or our\ncollaborators are unable to develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize KORSUVA injection or any of our other current or future product candidates, which would limit our ability to generate product revenues. Factors that may inhibit our or our partners\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 efforts to commercialize KORSUVA injection or our other current or future product candidates include:\n\u25cf inability to recruit, train, manage and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or educate adequate numbers of physicians on the benefits of prescribing KORSUVA injection or our other current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf inability to effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nOur or our partners\u2019 or our collaborators\u2019 sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing KORSUVA injection or any of our other current or future product candidates.\nIn the event that we are unable to successfully collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization to commercialize any approved product candidates outside the United States, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited. To the extent that we rely on third parties to commercialize products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts.\nWe face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other research organizations. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current products and product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of pain and pruritus. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nAmong the companies that currently market or are developing therapies in the pruritus space that, if approved, our products and product candidates may potentially compete with include: Pfizer, AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Amgen, Regeneron, Leo Pharma, Galderma, Chugai, Trevi and others.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than our products or our current or future product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for some of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. We expect that KORSUVA injection, and our product candidates (if approved), will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in R&D, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nTo the extent that KORSUVA injection or our product candidates, if approved, do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from sales will be limited.\nWe have never successfully commercialized a product or product candidate for any indication. KORSUVA injection and our other current or future product candidates, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, hospitals, dialysis providers, patients and third-party payers. If KORSUVA injection and any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval do not gain an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable. Market acceptance of KORSUVA injection, Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) and any future product candidate by physicians, hospitals, dialysis providers, patients and third-party payers will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. The degree of market acceptance of KORSUVA injection and any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with such product or product candidate;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in the product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling, including potential limitations or warnings for such product candidate, that may be more restrictive than other pain management or pruritus products;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for such product candidate, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we could make following additional FDA approval, if obtained;\n\u25cf the relative convenience and ease of administration of such product or product candidate;\n\u25cf cost of treatment versus economic and clinical benefit in relation to alternative treatments or therapies;\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payers, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf the extent and strength of our marketing and distribution of such product or product candidate;\n\u25cf the safety, efficacy and other potential advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments already used to treat acute pain, chronic pain and/or pruritus;\n\u25cf distribution and use restrictions, if any, imposed by the FDA with respect to such product candidate or to which we agree as part of a mandatory risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or voluntary risk management plan;\n\u25cf the timing of market introduction of such product or product candidate, as well as competitive products;\n\u25cf our ability to offer such product or product candidate for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; and\n\u25cf the clinical indications for such product or product candidate if approved.\nOur and our commercial partners\u2019 ability to effectively promote and sell KORSUVA injection and our current and future product candidates, if approved, will also depend on pricing and cost effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and achieve acceptance of the product onto dialysis organization or hospital formularies, and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. Generally, before we or our commercial partners can attempt to sell a product in a hospital or dialysis provider, it must be approved for addition to that institution\u2019s list of drugs approved for use in that institution, or formulary list. In evaluating drugs for inclusion on the formulary list, hospitals and dialysis providers evaluate a variety of factors, including cost. The frequency with which hospitals and dialysis providers add and remove drugs from their formulary lists varies from organization to organization, and institutions often require additional information prior to adding new drugs to their formulary, which may result in substantial delays in our receiving formulary approval for KORSUVA injection. Since most hospitals are members of group purchasing organizations, which leverage the purchasing power of a group of entities to obtain discounts based on the collective buying power of the group, our and our commercial partners\u2019 ability to access customers in the hospital marketplace will also depend on our ability to effectively promote KORSUVA injection and our product candidates to group purchasing organizations. We will also need to demonstrate acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy, as well as relative convenience and ease of administration. Market acceptance could be limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with KORSUVA injection and our product candidates.\nIn addition, the potential market opportunity for KORSUVA injection and for our product candidates is difficult to precisely estimate. Our internal estimates of the potential market opportunity for our products and product candidates include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports, assessment of competition, and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, no independent source has verified such assumptions. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our products and product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of our potential market opportunity. If the actual market for our products and product candidates is small, and/or smaller than we expect, our product revenue may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur and our commercial partners\u2019 efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of KORSUVA injection and our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Even if the medical community accepts that KORSUVA injection or one of our product candidates is safe and effective for its approved indications, physicians and patients may not immediately be receptive to such product or product candidate and may be slow to adopt it as an accepted treatment of pain or pruritus. It is unlikely that any future labeling approved by the FDA will contain claims that one of our products or product candidates is safer or more effective than competitive products or will permit us to promote such products or product candidate as being superior to competing products. Further, the availability of inexpensive generic forms of products for acute and chronic pain as well as pruritus may also limit acceptance of KORSUVA injection and our product candidates among physicians, patients and third-party payers. If KORSUVA injection and our current and any future product candidate, if approved, does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, patients and third-party payers, we may not generate meaningful revenues from KORSUVA injection or our current and future product candidates, and we may not become profitable.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for KORSUVA injection or our other current and future product candidates that we may develop and may have to limit their commercialization.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the sale of our products to, use of our products by, and testing of our product candidates in, seriously ill patients. For example, product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. We may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of\nwarranties. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf loss of revenue from decreased demand for our products and/or product candidates;\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation or financial stability;\n\u25cf costs of related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf diversion of management attention and scientific resources from our business operations;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs;\n\u25cf the inability to successfully commercialize our products and/or product candidates;\n\u25cf significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators or increased regulatory scrutiny;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWith respect to KORSUVA injection and any of our other product candidates that are approved for commercial sale, we are, and will be, highly dependent upon physician and patient perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Because of our dependence upon consumer perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from patients\u2019 use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our products and our clinical trials with a $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage limit in the United States and various other coverage limits outside of the United States. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing, or at all. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nOur business, operations and clinical development and regulatory timelines and plans have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have concentrations of third-party manufacturers, clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers or CROs upon whom we rely. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local and\nforeign governments have put in place, and continue to enforce in full or in part, quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders and similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease and its variants. Such orders or restrictions, and the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects that have negatively impacted the global economy and could disrupt our business and operations. We have implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees, and we may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or which we determine are in the best interests of our employees. Moreover, our clinical development and regulatory timelines and plans could be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Site initiation and patient enrollment has been, and could in the future be, affected and some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and the ability to conduct follow up visits with treated patients may be limited if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the initiation of certain trial sites and patient enrollment for certain of our clinical trials, including our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for NP and for the treatment of pruritus in patients with hepatic impairment due to PBC. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our third-party manufacturers may be shut down or have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations, which may disrupt commercial and clinical drug supply chain continuity and the commercial launch of KORSUVA injection. In addition, COVID-19 may cause our third-party manufacturers of KORSUVA injection to operate at reduced capacity. While we currently do not expect any significant delays in our clinical development or commercial timelines, the ultimate impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict.\nFurther, the spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the potential impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of both its regulatory approval and commercialization. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for AD-aP, NDD-CKD, CLD-PBC and NP. Further, at this time, we have de-prioritized the PONV program, as part of our strategy to focus on pruritus. As a result, we may have foregone or delayed, or may in the future forgo or delay, pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future R&D programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to identify and develop products and if we do not successfully identify and develop product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nA component of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by developing products that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus on pain and pruritus therapeutics. However, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development;\n\u25cf disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u25cf higher than expected development costs;\n\u25cf exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf difficulty in managing multiple product development programs; and\n\u25cf inability to successfully develop new products or clinical failure.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the development of products. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential development that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates, we may not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required additional regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. In August 2021, the FDA approved KORSUVA injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CKD-aP in adults undergoing hemodialysis in the U.S. Our partner, VFMCRP, submitted an MAA to the EMA in March 2021. We have not obtained regulatory approval for our other product candidates and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates, including KORSUVA injection in the EMA and Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin), or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future, will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing that product candidate. We expect to continue to rely on third-party CROs and consultants to assist us in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for that indication. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of\nclinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trial results may not be successful. We may also experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u25cf clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf we may have to suspend clinical trials, as in the case of the IND clinical hold placed on our adaptive Phase 3 trial of I.V. difelikefalin for postoperative pain in February 2016, which was subsequently removed in April 2016, or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf changes in marketing approval policies during the development period;\n\u25cf changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u25cf our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials.\nIn addition, unfavorable changes in our industry or the global economy, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could contribute to some of the events listed above and further impact our ability to progress our clinical trials, submit for marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, if approved, as planned. Further, if and to the extent, global health concerns prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our additional regulatory submissions, which could affect our ability\nto obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, including our MAA to the EMA submitted in March 2021.\nMoreover, if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u25cf have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies, including with respect to third-party technology used in any of our product candidates such as the excipient we intend to use for Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin). In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nFinally, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for our product candidates to assure safe use of the product candidates, either as a condition of product candidate approval or on the basis of new safety information.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product candidate or if the label for a product candidate does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nFor our approved product, KORSUVA injection, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nKORSUVA injection and any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data (if any), labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, continued compliance with cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping and cGCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Even if marketing approval of a\nproduct candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including any requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the products, manufacturers, manufacturing facilities or manufacturing process;\n\u25cf imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning letters;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf recall of products and publicity requirements;\n\u25cf fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf product seizure, detentions or import bans\u037e or\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained.\nRegulatory approval is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, and we may be subject to fines, penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses, resulting in damage to our reputation and business.\nWhen the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities issue regulatory approval for a product candidate, the regulatory approval is limited to those specific indications for which a product is approved. For example, the FDA approved KORSUVA injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CKD-AP in adults undergoing hemodialysis indication. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, we are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products for indications that are not specifically approved by the FDA. These \u201coff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the United States generally do not restrict or regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on off-label use. If the FDA determines that our or our commercial partners\u2019 promotional activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our promotional materials. Further, off-label promotion could subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA and other agencies, including issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdraw an approved product from the market, mandatory or voluntary recalls, civil fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could significantly harm our business.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we or our collaborators or partners must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. For example, our partner, VFMCRP, submitted an MAA to the EMA in March 2021, which was accepted for review by the EMA. Although we obtained FDA approval of KORSUVA injection in the U.S., the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our or our collaborators\u2019 or partners\u2019 ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We or our collaborators or partners may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nOur products, including KORSUVA injection, may have undesirable side effects that may require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales. Further, our product candidates may have serious adverse events or undesirable side effects that may limit dosing in development, delay or prevent regulatory or marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to limit dosage in development or interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. For example, in February 2016, the FDA placed our adaptive trial of I.V. difelikefalin for postoperative pain on IND clinical hold pending a safety review. The\nclinical hold was based on a stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L. After the safety review was completed, the FDA removed this clinical hold in April 2016 and the clinical trial was resumed in June 2016. If other concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may order us to cease further development, decline to approve the drug or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. The number of such requests for additional data or information issued by the FDA in recent years has increased and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs. Undesirable side effects caused by I.V. difelikefalin or any of our other current or future product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of I.V. difelikefalin for acute post-operative pain or any other product candidate. Approval of our current or future product candidates may include aspects of product labeling that limit its commercial use, including a Boxed Warning, REMS or other limitations of use.\nTo date, the side effects observed in the completed I.V. difelikefalin clinical trials include dizziness, transient facial tingling, a state of near-sleep, or somnolence, and hypernatremia, an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood, which we believe is secondary, at least in part, to another side effect, aquaresis, that is defined as electrolyte-free urination. As described above, the observation of mild to moderate hypernatremia in our adaptive trial for postoperative pain triggered a stopping rule in the trial protocol and led the FDA to institute an IND clinical hold related to the trial, pending a safety review. Prolonged aquaresis can result in a negative fluid balance if the excreted water is not replaced by oral or intravenous fluids, and although we recommend steps to control fluid balance, we cannot be certain that such instructions will be followed by healthcare providers and/or patients, and failure to follow such instructions may be accompanied by adverse events associated with negative fluid balance, including disability and death. We believe that one such adverse event, which has been observed, postural tachycardia, an elevation of heart rate upon standing up, is a physiological reflex that can be triggered as a result of decreased intravascular volume caused by a negative fluid balance. We have observed transient prolactin elevations, which are brief increases in the concentration of the hormone prolactin in the bloodstream, in response to I.V. difelikefalin, which we have measured as a nonselective opioid biomarker since both kappa and mu opioids elicit this effect. We cannot be certain that such elevations in prolactin will be transient, safe, and well tolerated in all patients. In addition, previously developed kappa opioid agonists, the pharmacological class of drugs that difelikefalin belongs to, have been associated with poorly tolerated psychiatric side effects, such as a feeling of emotional and mental discomfort, or dysphoria, and hallucinations, at high doses, particularly for prior generations of kappa opioid agonists with substantially unrestricted or only partially restricted entry to the CNS. Although we have not observed psychiatric side effects in any difelikefalin clinical trials to date, we cannot be certain that these side effects or others will not be observed in the future, or that the FDA will not require additional trials or impose more severe labeling restrictions due to these side effects or other concerns. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, our products, including KORSUVA injection, are subject to continuing regulatory oversight. Drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. The subsequent delivery of previously unknown problems with a product, or public speculation about adverse safety events, could face a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u25cf we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf issue warning letters;\n\u25cf mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u25cf require us or our collaborators to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25cf impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require a product recall;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u25cf the sales of the product may decrease significantly; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of KORSUVA injection and the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we experience continuous delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for, and design of, the trial in question;\n\u25cf the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf competition in recruiting and enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u25cf the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and\n\u25cf delays or difficulties due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor example, we experienced a delay in patient enrollment for our Phase 2 clinical trial of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for the treatment of pruritus in patients with hepatic impairment due to PBC, and could in the future experience delays in either of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials as patient enrollment in both of these trials is not yet complete.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. We may encounter difficulties and/or delays in completing our planned enrollments. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, or the inability to complete development of our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and materially impair our ability to generate revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses from our inception, and although we generated net income in 2020, we anticipate that we may incur losses in the foreseeable future. Our first commercial product was only recently approved, and we may never maintain profitability.\nWe are an early commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company. For the last several years, we have focused our efforts primarily on developing KORSUVA injection and Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) with the goal of achieving regulatory approval and in August 2021, the FDA approved KORSUVA injection for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CKD-aP in adults undergoing hemodialysis. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses. We incurred net losses of $88.4 million and $106.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $480.8 million. Although we generated net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a commercial license transaction, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses in the foreseeable future, as we continue to prepare for the commercialization of KORSUVA injection and develop and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly from year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, the receipt of additional milestone payments, if any, under our agreements with Vifor, VFMCRP, Maruishi and CKDP, the receipt of payments under any future agreements we may enter into, and our expenditures on other R&D activities as well as any payments owed under the License Agreement with Enteris and any future similar agreements.\nIn addition, we expect to incur significant sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses related to our product candidates, if they are approved by the FDA, and expenses related to the commercialization of KORSUVA injection. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we:\n\u25cf continue the development of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for AD-aP, NDD-CKD, CLD-PBC and NP;\n\u25cf seek regulatory approvals for any other product candidate that successfully completes clinical trials;\n\u25cf establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any other products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our global intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and\n\u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development and potential future commercialization efforts.\nTo become and remain profitable from product sales, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing one or more products that generate significant revenue. For example, revenues from KORSUVA injection may not be sufficient to enable us to reach profitability. In order to commercialize any additional product\ncandidates, we will need to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including successful registration of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin), discovering additional product candidates and completing preclinical testing and clinical trials for those product candidates, potentially entering into collaboration and license agreements, obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling approved products and product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we do achieve profitability from product sales, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our R&D efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe commenced operations in 2004, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and advancing our products and product candidates, including KORSUVA injection and Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin), through clinical development. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully commercialize a product. With the approval of KORSUVA injection, we will need to expand our capabilities to support commercial activities of our commercial partners. We may not be successful in adding such capabilities. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nConducting clinical trials, pursuing regulatory approvals, establishing outsourced manufacturing relationships and successfully manufacturing and commercializing our products and product candidates is expensive. We may need to raise additional capital to:\n\u25cf fund our operations and continue our efforts to hire additional personnel for the commercialization of KORSUVA injection;\n\u25cf qualify and outsource the commercial-scale manufacturing of our products, including KORSUVA injection, under cGMP;\n\u25cf continue the further development of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for AD-aP, NDD-CKD, CLD-PBC and NP; and\n\u25cf in-license other product candidates.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we believe that with our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements through 2023, without giving effect to any additional potential milestone payments or potential product revenue we may receive under our licensing and collaboration agreements with Vifor, VFMCRP, Maruisihi and CKDP. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could spend our available financial resources faster than we currently expect. Further, because we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet all of\nour development objectives, in particular the completion of our development of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for the treatment of AD-aP, NDD-CKD, CLD-PBC and NP, we will need to raise additional capital. If we are not able to do so, we could be required to postpone, scale back or eliminate some, or all, of these objectives. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the success of the commercialization of KORSUVA injection and any current and future product candidates;\n\u25cf the cost and timing of manufacturing sufficient supplies of KORSUVA injection for commercialization;\n\u25cf the rate of progress and costs related to Phase 2 and Phase 3 development of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) for our product candidates and other indications;\n\u25cf the rate of progress and costs for the submission and review of an NDA for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval;\n\u25cf the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u25cf the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, milestone and royalty payments from corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements, as well as through interest income earned on cash and investment balances. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the continuing disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate, one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on third parties to decide to utilize KORSUVA injection and to make it readily available at the point of care throughout their dialysis centers or hospitals.\nIn addition to extensive internal efforts, the successful commercialization of KORSUVA injection will require many third parties, over whom we have no control, to decide to utilize KORSUVA injection and to make it readily available at the point of care throughout their hospitals. These third parties include physicians, dialysis providers, pharmacists and hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees, which are commonly referred to as P&T committees. Generally, before we can attempt to sell KORSUVA injection in a hospital or dialysis center, it must be approved for addition to that hospital or dialysis center\u2019s list of approved drugs, or formulary list, by the institution\u2019s P&T committee. An institutional P&T committee typically governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the institution, including review of medication formulary data and recommendations for the appropriate use of drugs within the institution to the medical staff. The frequency of P&T committee meetings at various institutions varies considerably, and P&T committees often require additional information to aid in their decision-making process, so we may experience substantial delays in obtaining formulary approvals. Additionally, institutions may be concerned that the cost of acquiring KORSUVA injection for use in their institutions will adversely impact their overall pharmacy budgets, which could cause institution staff to resist efforts to add KORSUVA injection to the formulary, or to implement restrictions on the usage of the drug in order to control costs, either initially or later, when the increasing use of KORSUVA injection\nwithin their institution begins to significantly impact their budgets. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in getting the approvals we need from enough P&T committees and overcoming any financial objections raised by institution staff quickly enough to maintain and grow institutional sales of KORSUVA injection.\nWe rely on third parties to perform many essential services for KORSUVA injection and may do so in the future for any products that we commercialize, including services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize KORSUVA injection or any other product candidate, will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe retain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of KORSUVA injection and may do so in the future for our other current or future product candidates, key aspects of which will be out of our direct control. These service providers provide key services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, customer service, accounts receivable management and cash collection, and, as a result, most of our inventory are stored at a single warehouse maintained by one such service provider. Thus, we substantially rely on it as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we have engaged third parties to perform various other services for us relating to adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding our product candidates and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, or these third parties otherwise fail to comply with regulatory requirements related to adverse event reporting, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe are dependent on our collaboration agreements for certain revenues, and if our commercial partners do not perform their obligations under such agreements, we could lose revenues.\nIn October 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Vifor under which we granted Vifor an exclusive license solely in the United States to use, distribute, offer for sale, promote, sell and otherwise commercialize our product candidate KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection for all therapeutic uses relating to the inhibition, prevention or treatment of itch associated with pruritus in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients in the United States. In May 2018, we entered into an agreement with VFMCRP under which we granted VFMCRP a license to seek regulatory approval to commercialize, import, export, use, distribute, offer for sale, promote, sell and otherwise commercialize KORSUVA (difelikefalin) injection for all therapeutic uses to prevent, inhibit or treat itch associated with pruritus in hemodialysis and peritoneal-dialysis patients worldwide (excluding the United States, Japan and South Korea). In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with Maruishi under which we granted Maruishi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing difelikefalin in Japan. Also, in April 2012, we entered into an agreement with CKDP under which we granted CKDP an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing difelikefalin in South Korea. Under the VFMCRP Agreement, we are responsible, at our own cost, to undertake clinical and non-clinical development. We are also responsible to provide all content and subject matter expertise required for registration with the EMA in the EU that will be needed by VFMCRP for such registration, including participation in regulatory meetings, as needed. VFMCRP will contribute, at its own cost, its clinical development expertise as reasonably useful for such development activities, such as preparing the clinical results that we present to it in a format acceptable to the EMA to obtain marketing approval in the EU. Maruishi and CKDP are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at their expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize difelikefalin in Japan and South Korea, respectively. Our receipt of milestone payments and royalties under these agreements is dependent on the continued efforts by Vifor, VFMCRP, Maruishi and CKDP, respectively, and their failure to adequately develop or commercialize the licensed products, or any default or inability to meet their payment obligations under their respective agreements, could harm our revenues and business.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we are a party to, such as our collaboration with Vifor Pharma, or may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur business model is to commercialize our product and product candidates in the United States and generally to seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our product candidates in the rest of the world. We currently have license agreements with Vifor and VFMCRP (KORSUVA injection for CKD-aP in dialysis patients) as well as Maruishi and CKDP (difelikefalin - both I.V. and Oral). In addition to our existing agreements, we may enter into additional collaboration arrangements in the future on a selective basis. Our existing collaborations and future collaboration arrangements may not be successful. The success of our existing and future collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators.\nCollaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaboration arrangements. Disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority.\nCollaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. For example, the Vifor, VFMCRP, Maruishi and CKDP Agreements may be terminated by our collaborator for our breach or insolvency, each of Vifor and VFMCRP may terminate its respective agreement (in its entirety or with respect to any countries within the Territory upon written notice to us) upon the earlier of (1) acceptance for filing of an NDA covering Licensed Product filed with the FDA (after completion of the Phase 3 program) or (2) the third anniversary of the Effective Date. Maruishi may terminate its agreement with us at will, and CKDP may terminate its agreement with us in certain circumstances relating to patent invalidity or unenforceability or generic entry by a third party, as further described in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Collaboration and License Agreements\u201d above. Any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. Our current collaborations and any future collaborations we might enter into may pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could fail to make timely regulatory submissions for a product or product candidate;\n\u25cf collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements or may fail to report safety data in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products or product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of products and product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to products and product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u25cf collaborations, including our collaboration with Maruishi, may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nAdditionally, collaborators may elect not to pursue, or pursue as vigorously, the development or commercialization of our product or product candidates as a result of external factors, such as an acquisition or merger. For example, Vifor recently entered into a merger agreement with CSL Limited, a global specialty pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which CSL Limited would acquire all publicly held Vifor Pharma shares if such transaction is completed. When biopharma companies are acquired, it is not uncommon for the acquiring company to have a different strategic focus and priorities than those of the acquired company, which could lead to different decisions with respect to product commercialization efforts. Accordingly, if the acquisition is consummated, CSL Limited may choose not to prioritize KORSUVA injection to the same extent as Vifor Pharma would as a standalone company. If this were to occur, it is possible that the commercialization of KORSUVA injection could suffer, which would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf our current collaborations or any other collaborations we might enter into in the future do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our product candidates and our product platform. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the activities of our collaborators in their respective jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, if any current or future collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our reputation in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected.\nFor KORSUVA injection and any other current or future product candidates, we may in the future determine to collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for their development and potential commercialization. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and\nexpertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform or successfully commercialize our products and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Legal and Compliance Matters\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, and transparency laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency and patients\u2019 rights may be applicable to our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability, and our partners\u2019 and collaborators\u2019 ability, to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates, among other things, our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, recommendation, lease, order or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including without limitation the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties law, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment or approval from a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid);\n\u25cf Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; and\n\u25cf state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to the pricing of certain drugs, as well as payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies continue to be prosecuted under the federal false claims laws for numerous activities, including those related to research, sales, marketing and promotional programs. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes. As a result, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state transparency and fraud and abuse laws may prove costly. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business, including our partners or collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business.\nChanges in and failures to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may subject us to liabilities and adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as information that we collect about participants and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our service providers\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal data, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the U.S., HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, certain healthcare providers, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information. In the event we are subject to HIPAA and we or our covered subcontractors fail to properly maintain the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information, or we or our covered subcontractors are responsible for an inadvertent disclosure or security breach of such individually identifiable health information, we could be subject to enforcement measures, including civil and criminal penalties and fines for violations of state and federal privacy or security standards, such as HIPAA and HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which takes effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., such as similar privacy legislation in Virginia and in Colorado, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we or our partners, collaborators, customers, or service providers must comply. For example, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduced strict requirements for processing personal data. The GDPR is likely to increase compliance burden on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and leverage information about them or how we obtain consent from them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators and supervisory bodies involved in the review and approval of clinical trials. In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nU.S. and foreign data protection laws, regulations and standards are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws, to the extent such requirements are deemed to apply to our operations, could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf the government or other third-party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement and payment rates for KORSUVA injection or any of our other current or future product candidates, if any, or if providers choose to use therapies that are less expensive, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be limited.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of KORSUVA injection and our future products (if approved) will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Such third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate. KORSUVA injection for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients is expected to be designated as a component of the government\u2019s bundled reimbursement for end stage renal disease treatment.\nOur U.S. commercial partner, Vifor Pharma Group, submitted the payment reimbursement application for TDAPA and HCPCS to CMS in September 2021. In December 2021, CMS granted TDAPA to KORSUVA injection in the anti-pruritic functional category. TDAPA will apply to KORSUVA injection beginning April 1, 2022 for two years.\nAdditionally, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a pre-determined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as payment in full. Because, in these instances, the amount of reimbursement that such providers receive may not be based on the actual expenses the provider incurs, providers may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Accordingly, KORSUVA injection or any of our other current or future product candidates, if approved, will face competition from other therapies and drugs for these limited provider financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to the satisfaction of hospitals, other target customers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nThird-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to recent legislation, regulatory proposals and healthcare payer initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our ability to market our products, obtain collaborators and raise capital.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed the Health Care Reform Law, which includes provisions that have changed, and likely will continue to change, health care financing and the delivery of health care in the United States. Among the provisions of the Health Care Reform Law of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u25cf an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u25cf an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u25cf a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u25cf a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25cf extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25cf expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u25cf expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u25cf new transparency requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act;\n\u25cf a new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities;\n\u25cf a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u25cf a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u25cf establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending\u037e and\n\u25cf expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance.\nThere have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Health Care Reform Law will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Health Care Reform Law marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Health Care Reform Law. It is also unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Health Care Reform Law and our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. These changes include, among other things, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went effective on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug\u2019s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is considering additional health reform measures. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures.\nWe expect that the Health Care Reform Law, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for KORSUVA injection or any approved product candidate. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. In addition, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and\nenacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule in September 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinds the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug\u2019s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing.\nLegislation and regulations that, among other things, reduce drug prices or require the implementation of costly compliance measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts, and we cannot predict what legislation will be enacted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn international markets, reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In some countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a\nclinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by such individuals could include intentional failures to:\n\u25cf comply with FDA regulations and other similar foreign regulations;\n\u25cf provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA;\n\u25cf comply with manufacturing standards;\n\u25cf comply with federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the United States and similar foreign laws;\n\u25cf report financial information or data accurately; or\n\u25cf disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, including off label uses of our products, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs, patient assistance programs, and other business arrangements generally. Third party misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur manufacturing activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our products, product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, these hazardous materials. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial fines and penalties. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed\nby these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In addition, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of any contamination, whether currently unknown or caused by future releases.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and as a result we may not be able to ensure their protection and all patents will eventually expire.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for difelikefalin for our KORSUVA injection or other product candidates and for any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire and the methods we use to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents and trade secrets against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute to issuance all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our R&D output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, should we enter into additional collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be successfully prosecuted to issuance and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. Moreover, the patent application process is also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting difelikefalin and any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire by obtaining and defending patents. For example:\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our product candidates or technologies;\n\u25cf it is possible that none of the pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf the issued patents covering our product candidates may not provide a basis for commercially viable active products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf competitors may file trademark infringement claims or challenges to the validity of our trademark(s);\n\u25cf noncompliance with governmental patent agencies requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction, potentially allowing competitors to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\n\u25cf our competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates; or\n\u25cf there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of available patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office has developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, including and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our currently pending and future patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nPatent applications in the United States are generally maintained in confidence for at least 18 months after their earliest effective filing date and in certain circumstances not until granted when no foreign counterpart patent applications are filed. Furthermore, published patent applications may issue at a later date with new and/or amended claims substantially different from those published earlier. Consequently, we cannot be certain we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on difelikefalin or any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire.\nUntil recent changes to the U.S. Patent Laws, patents and patent applications relating to substantially similar claimed inventions were potentially subject to interference proceedings to determine the first applicant to invent the claimed subject matter. For an interference to be declared against our patents and patent applications, any such interference would be under the 1952 law which was eliminated by the America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in 2011 and fully effective in 2013. Such an interference would therefore have to relate to a patent or application with an effective filing date before March 16, 2013. No interference with such a patent or application has been declared to date. Therefore, it seems extremely unlikely that we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States against one or more parties claiming the same or similar invention. However, in the unlikely event that such interference was to be declared, the costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. The results of these types of proceedings could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade\ncompanies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the patentability of claims in pending patent applications covering KORSUVA injection or other difelikefalin-based product can be challenged by third parties during prosecution in the USPTO under the new AIA law of 2013, for example by third party observations and derivation proceedings, and the validity of claims in issued patents can be challenged by third parties in various post-grant proceedings such as Post-Grant Review, Inter-partes Reexamination, and Inter-partes Review proceedings.\nFurthermore, we may not have identified all United States and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug market. In addition, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. Even if patents issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid and enforceable or provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or otherwise be commercially valuable to us.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our licensors, employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for difelikefalin or any other product candidate that we may develop, license or acquire, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we or any current or future collaboration partner are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business.\nOur ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell KORSUVA injection or any of our other current of future product candidates depends upon our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and our commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of pain management and cover the use of numerous compounds and formulations in our targeted markets. Third parties\nmay assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Because of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving proprietary rights, we and our licensors may not be successful in defending intellectual property claims by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that KORSUVA injection or our other current or future product candidates may infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that KORSUVA injection or our other current or future product candidates may inadvertently infringe.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third-party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, we could face a number of issues, including:\n\u25cf infringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, can be expensive and time consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf substantial damages for past infringement which we may have to pay if a court decides that our product infringes on a competitor\u2019s patent;\n\u25cf a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which it would not be required to do;\n\u25cf if a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and\n\u25cf redesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nThe validity and enforceability of the patents and applications that cover KORSUVA injection and our difelikefalin product candidates can be challenged by competitors.\nFor KORSUVA injection and in the event that an Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) or any future product candidate is approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the patents covering these products and product candidates, which could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims.\nFor example, if a third party files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic drug product containing difelikefalin, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (2) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (3) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third-party\u2019s generic drug product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for difelikefalin, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third-party\u2019s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third-party\u2019s ANDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third-party\u2019s ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur internal information technology systems, or those of our CROs, contract manufacturers or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer cybersecurity breaches, loss or leakage of data and other disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our development programs, commercialization efforts, compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party contractors who have access to our confidential information.\nDespite the implementation of cybersecurity measures, given their size and complexity and the increasing amounts of confidential information that they maintain, our internal information technology systems and those of our third-party CROs, contract manufacturers and other contractors and consultants are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as cybersecurity breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage. Cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions, especially as more employees are working remotely, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states and other external parties. To the extent that any disruption or cybersecurity breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and reputational damage and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWhile we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or cybersecurity breach to date, we cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could adversely affect our business. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs and the development and commercialization of KORSUVA injection, if approved, could be delayed. In addition, the loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase\nour costs to recover or reproduce the data. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information technology systems or cybersecurity breaches could result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our clinical trial subjects or employees, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could adversely affect our business.\nWe may need to significantly increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of February 24, 2022, we had 84 employees. Our management and personnel systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support future growth. In addition, we may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, particularly for sales and marketing positions, due to competition for personnel among pharmaceutical businesses, and the failure to do so could have a significant negative impact on our future product revenues and business results. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n\u25cf ensure that our consultants and other service providers successfully carry out their contractual obligations, provide high quality results, and meet expected deadlines;\n\u25cf continue to carry out our own contractual obligations to our licensors and other third parties; and\n\u25cf continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement these tasks on a larger scale and, accordingly, may not achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nWe depend on skilled personnel to operate our business effectively in a rapidly changing market, and if we are unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel when needed, or manage transitions among members of our leadership team, our ability to develop and sell our products could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific and clinical personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our management team, including our President and CEO. Most recently, we appointed a new President and CEO in November 2021, at which time our former President and CEO, who had served in such position since 2004, transitioned to the role of Senior Advisor to the Company. This transition may be disruptive to our business. Further, our senior management may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to execute an orderly transition and successfully integrate our new CEO into our management team, or if we lose one or more members of our senior management team, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed. Replacing these employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate additional key personnel. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Global Market. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are now required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we are also required to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Further, we may in the future discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Moreover, our internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. Moreover, we are aware that the remote working arrangements implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic potentially present new areas of risk, including cyber, privacy and productivity risks, and we are carefully monitoring any impact to our internal controls and procedures.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nSince our initial public offering in January 2014, our stock price has been volatile and it is likely that the trading price of our common stock will continue to be volatile. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf delays in the commencement, enrollment and ultimate completion of our clinical trials, including our planned trials for Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin);\n\u25cf any delay or refusal on the part of the FDA in approving an NDA for our other current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf the commercial success of KORSUVA injection and, if approved by the FDA, Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin), such as our announcement of topline results from the Phase 2 clinical trial of Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) tablets for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus in mild-to-severe AD in April 2021, or any future product candidate or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community, including securities analysts;\n\u25cf introduction of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf changes or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\u25cf the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u25cf general trends in our industry or economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf developments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply, warehousing and inventory control;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments relating to patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u25cf announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u25cf capital commitments;\n\u25cf investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u25cf announcements and expectations of additional financing efforts, including the issuance of debt, equity or convertible securities;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or significant stockholders;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuations of companies similar to us;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or divestitures;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors, such as those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFurther, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nIf equity research analysts cease to publish research or reports about us or if they publish unfavorable research or reports about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is likely to be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf our or our partners\u2019 or our collaborators\u2019 ability to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure to successfully launch KORSUVA injection without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;\n\u25cf the successful progress of our clinical trials for Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) and other potential future product candidates;\n\u25cf whether the FDA requires us to complete additional, unanticipated studies, tests or other activities prior to approving our other current or future product candidates, which would likely further delay any such approval;\n\u25cf our ability to identify, enter into and maintain third party manufacturing arrangements capable of manufacturing KORSUVA injection or our other current or future product candidates in commercial quantities;\n\u25cf our execution of other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u25cf variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n\u25cf any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u25cf regulatory developments affecting KORSUVA injection, Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin), any of our future product candidates, or the product candidates of our competitors; and\n\u25cf for KORSUVA injection, and if Oral KORSUVA (difelikefalin) or any of our future product candidates receives regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for such product and product candidate and wholesaler buying patterns.\nIf our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, grants and license and development agreements in\nconnection with any collaborations. We do not yet have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or KORSUVA injection or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Any debt financing that we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our stock or make investments. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe use of our net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits may be limited.\nA portion of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and R&D tax credits may expire and not be used. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $443.1 million and $347.3 million, respectively, and we also had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $19.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Our NOL carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes (to the extent such federal NOLs are generated in taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017) and 2027 for state purposes if we have not used them prior to that time, and our federal R&D tax credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously used. The federal NOLs arising in 2018 and forward have an unlimited carryforward period and losses from 2018-2020 may be carried back five years due to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, or the CARES Act. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act. To the extent that we have not exchanged our Connecticut R&D tax credits for a tax refund, those tax credits carry forward indefinitely. Additionally, our ability to use any NOL and R&D tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax, respectively, in the future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, respectively, if we have a cumulative change in ownership of our stock of more than 50% within a three-year period. The completion of our initial public offering in 2014 and our follow-on public offerings in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019, together with private placements and other transactions that have occurred, may have triggered such ownership changes. We conducted a 382 analysis in the first quarter of 2021. This analysis showed a limited change of ownership had occurred, and the amount of NOL carryforwards and R&D tax credits that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. In addition, since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo ownership changes in the future. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the NOL carryforwards and R&D tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have in the past suspended use of NOL carryforwards for certain taxable years (including Connecticut which currently limits the use of NOL carryforwards by 50% and without limitation legislation enacted by California in June 2020 that suspends the use of California NOLs and limits the use of California R&D tax credits for certain years), and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, limitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNew or future changes to tax laws could materially adversely affect our company.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA, which significantly amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which was modified by the CARES Act. We continue to examine the impact these changes may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA and CARES Act, or any other future changes in tax laws, is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, proposals have recently been made in Congress (which have not yet been enacted) that\ninclude tax law changes that could have a material adverse impact on us. The impact of the TCJA and CARES Act and any future changes in tax laws on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, your returns will be limited to any increase in the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, if any. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u25cf our Board of Directors are divided into three classes, with only one class of directors elected each year;\n\u25cf our stockholders are entitled to remove directors only for cause upon a 66 2/3% vote;\n\u25cf our stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u25cf our stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u25cf our stockholders must give us advance notice of their intent to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.", "PERMNO": 14422, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CARA"}
