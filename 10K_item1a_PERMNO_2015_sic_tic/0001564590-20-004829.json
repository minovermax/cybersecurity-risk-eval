{"cik": "1627223", "company": "Chemours Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Based on current information, we believe that the following identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. See our \u201cForward-looking Statements\u201d for more details.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.\nWe face risks arising from various unasserted and asserted legal claims, investigations and litigation matters, such as product liability claims, patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental actions (which may concern regulated or unregulated substances) or other torts. We have noted a nationwide trend in purported mass tort and class actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation, and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental actions (which may concern regulated or unregulated substances) or other torts without claiming present personal injuries. We also have noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging harm to the general public and damages to natural resources. Various factors or developments in these nationwide trends or in the actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on us. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results and/or stock price, and could adversely impact the value of any of our brands that are associated with any such matters. As discussed below, we are a named defendant and/or indemnifying and defending DuPont in litigation related to the production and use of perfluorooctanoic acids and its salts, including the ammonium salt (\u201cPFOA\u201d); hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (\u201cHFPO Dimer Acid,\u201d sometimes referred to as \u201cGenX\u201d or \u201cC3 Dimer Acid\u201d); Aqueous Film Forming Foam (\u201cAFFF\u201d); perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds (\u201cPFAS\u201d); and other compounds.\nWe have received inquiries, government investigations, directives, multiple lawsuits, and other actions related to PFOA, GenX, AFFF, and PFAS as discussed in more detail in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These or other governmental inquiries or lawsuits could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, a criminal or civil proceeding, the imposition of fines and penalties, and/or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our Fayetteville Works site in Fayetteville, North Carolina (\u201cFayetteville\u201d) or otherwise. Additional lawsuits or inquiries also could be instituted related to these or other compounds in the future. Accordingly, the existing lawsuits and inquiries, and any such additional litigation, relating to our existing operations, PFOA, HFPO Dimer Acid, AFFF, PFAS and other perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds, or other compounds associated with our products or operations, could result in us incurring additional costs and liabilities, which may be material to our financial results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties, and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. Additionally, we may be required to indemnify DuPont with regard to liabilities allocated to, or assumed by us, under each of the separation agreement, the employee matters agreement, the tax matters agreement, and the intellectual property cross-license agreement that were executed prior to the Separation. These indemnification obligations to date have included defense costs associated with certain litigation matters as well as certain damages awards, settlements, and penalties. On August 24, 2017, we and DuPont entered into an amendment to the separation agreement concerning future PFOA litigation and costs not covered by the MDL Settlement as detailed in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future PFOA-related costs and settlements could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, in the event that DuPont seeks indemnification for adverse trial rulings or outcomes, these indemnification claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Disputes with DuPont and others which may arise with respect to indemnification matters including disputes based on matters of law or contract interpretation, could materially adversely affect us.\nThe Chemours Company\nWe are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that may result in unanticipated loss or liability related to our current and past operations, and that may result in significant additional compliance costs or obligations, which in either case, could reduce our profitability.\nOur operations and production facilities are dependent upon attainment and renewal of requisite operating permits and are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws, regulations, and enforcements at national, international, and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, storing and disposing of hazardous wastes, and product content and other safety concerns. Such laws include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nU.S.-based regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA,\u201d often referred to as \u201cSuperfund\u201d), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) and similar state and global laws for management and remediation of hazardous materials, the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) and Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) and similar state and global laws for the protection of air and water resources, and the Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d);\n\u2022\nForeign-based chemical control regulations, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) in the EU, the Chemical Substances Control Law (\u201cCSCL\u201d) in Japan, MEP Order No. 7 in China, and the Toxic Chemical Substance Control Act (\u201cTCSCA\u201d) in Taiwan for the production and distribution of chemicals in commerce and reporting of potential adverse effects;\n\u2022\nThe EU Emissions Trading System and similar local and global laws for regulating greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions; and,\n\u2022\nNumerous local, state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and enforcements governing materials transport and packaging.\nIf we are found to be in violation of these laws, regulations, or enforcements, which may be subject to change based on legislative, scientific, or other factors, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, reputational harm, loss of sales or market access, or experience interruptions in our operations. We also may be subject to changes in our operations and production based on increased regulation or other changes to, or restrictions imposed by, any such additional regulations. Any operational interruptions or plant shutdowns may result in delays in production, or may cause us to incur additional costs to develop redundancies in order to avoid interruptions in our production cycles. In addition, the manner in which adopted regulations (including environmental and safety regulations) are ultimately implemented may affect our products, the demand for and public perception of our products, the reputation of our brands, our market access, and our results of operations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use or chemicals we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event and future reputational costs associated with any such event.\nOur costs of complying with complex environmental laws, regulations, and enforcements, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. These laws, regulations, and enforcements may change and could become more stringent over time, which could result in significant additional compliance costs, increased costs of purchased energy or other raw materials, investments in, or restrictions on, our operations, or installation or modification of GHG emitting equipment. As a result of our current and historic operations, including the operations of divested businesses and certain discontinued operations, we also expect to continue to incur costs for environmental investigation and remediation activities at a number of our current or former sites and third-party disposal locations. However, the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to accurately predict. While we establish accruals in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the ultimate actual costs and liabilities may vary from the accruals because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors (many of which are outside of our control), including the nature of the matter and any associated third-party claims, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other PRPs. See \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d within Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We also could incur significant additional costs as a result of additional contamination that is discovered or remedial obligations imposed in the future.\nThere is also a risk that one or more of our manufacturing processes, key raw materials, or products may be found to have, or be characterized or perceived as having, a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees or unregulated emissions, which could potentially result in our incurring liability in connection with such characterization and the associated effects of any toxicological or health-related impact. If such a discovery or characterization occurs, we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation. In addition, the relevant materials or products, including products of our customers incorporating our materials or products, may be recalled, phased-out, or banned. Changes in laws, science or regulations, or their interpretation, and our customers\u2019 perception of such changes or interpretations may also affect the marketability of certain of our products.\nThe Chemours Company\nFor example, in May 2016, the European Chemicals Agency (\u201cECHA\u201d) accepted a proposal from France\u2019s competent authority under REACH to change the classification of TiO2. ECHA\u2019s Committee for Risk Action (\u201cRAC\u201d) provided the opinion that the evidence meets the criteria under the EU\u2019s Classification, Labeling and Packaging (\u201cCLP\u201d) Regulation to classify TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen (suspected human carcinogen) by inhalation. To implement this opinion, the EU Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) presented a draft of the full 14th Adaptation to Technical Progress (\u201cATP\u201d), including a proposed classification (with notes) for the powder form of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen by inhalation, as a delegated act for scrutiny by EU Council and Parliament. The scrutiny period ended in February 2020, with publication to follow shortly thereafter. Publication will then be followed by an 18-month implementation period before the act comes into enforcement. Upon publication of the act and our subsequent review of the additional regulatory measures enacted, we may be subject to increased requirements for TiO2 product labeling, importing operations, and certain downstream use applications associated with TiO2. This could increase our costs associated with our TiO2 manufacturing and handling processes.\nIn June 2019, the Member States Committee of ECHA also voted to list HFPO Dimer Acid as a Substance of Very High Concern. The vote was based on Article 57(f) - equivalent level of concern having probable serious effects to the environment. This identification does not impose immediate regulatory restriction or obligations, but may lead to a future authorization or restriction of the substance, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In September 2019, Chemours filed an application with the EU Court of Justice for the annulment of the decision of ECHA to list HFPO Dimer Acid as a Substance of Very High Concern.\nThe businesses in which we compete are highly competitive. If our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if our competitors were to develop similar or superior intellectual property or technology, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nEach of the businesses in which we operate is highly competitive. Competition in the performance chemicals industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face significant competition from major international and regional competitors. Some of our competitors have announced plans to expand their chloride capacity. Additionally, our Titanium Technologies business competes with numerous regional producers, including producers in China, who have expanded their readily-available production capacity during the previous five years. The risk of substitution of these Chinese producers by our customers could increase as these Chinese producers expand their use of chloride production technology. Similarly, we compete with various producers in our Fluoroproducts business, and the risk of substitution of these producers by our customers could increase if these producers develop better capabilities to manufacture products similar to our specialty fluoropolymers.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, and tradenames are important to our business. We endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which our products are imported. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. However, we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend, or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how, or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins, or loss of market share.\nIf we must take legal action to protect, defend, or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend, or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Chemours Company\nRestrictions under the intellectual property cross-license agreement could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products and/or prosecute, maintain, and enforce certain intellectual property.\nWe depend to a certain extent on DuPont to prosecute, maintain, and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the intellectual property cross-license agreement. Specifically, DuPont is responsible for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents that DuPont licenses to us. DuPont also has the first right to enforce such patents, trade secrets, and the know-how licensed to us by DuPont. If DuPont fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents, trade secrets, or know-how under the intellectual property cross-license agreement, we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, and selling competitive products unless we are able to effectively exercise our secondary rights to enforce such patents, trade secrets, and know-how.\nIn addition, our restrictions under the intellectual property cross-license agreement could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products. For example, the licenses granted to us under the agreement may not extend to all new products, services, and businesses that we may enter in the future. These limitations and restrictions may make it more difficult, time-consuming, or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products and services, or may result in certain of our products or services being later to market than those of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological changes and product improvements, as well as changes in mandates on or regulation of products and services. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets, our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture, and market products in such changing end-use markets, and our ability to adapt to changing regulations. We must continue to identify, develop, and market innovative products or enhance existing products on a timely basis to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. We may be unable to develop new products or technologies, either alone or with third parties, or license intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially-competitive basis. If we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, including with respect to innovation with regard to the development of alternative uses for, or application of, products developed that utilize such end-use products, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets, customer behaviors and demands, competitive environments, and laws, regulations, or enforcements. We cannot anticipate market acceptance of new products or future products. In addition, we may not achieve our expected benefits associated with new products developed to meet new laws, regulations, or enforcements if the implementation of such laws, regulations, or enforcements is delayed, and we may face competition from illegal or counterfeit products in regulated markets.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by business disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions, plant downtime, power outages, and/or information technology system and network disruptions, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, military actions, and terrorism (including cyberterrorism) could seriously harm our operations, as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Further, the nature of our business dictates that we maintain significant concentrations of physical assets in certain geographical locations, some of which may be prone to weather-related events and natural disasters (which could be exacerbated by climate change). Such events could also seriously harm our operations, as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers, and accordingly, we continue to study the long-term implications of changing climate parameters on plant siting, operational issues, and water availability. Any of the aforementioned disruptions and/or events could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nFailure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, viruses, breaches due to employee error or other actions, or other disruptions, could result in misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales, and interference with regulatory compliance. Like most major corporations, we have been, and expect to be the target of industrial espionage, including cyberattacks, from time to time. We have determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information, and have included the obtaining of trade secrets and proprietary information related to the chloride manufacturing process for TiO2 pigment by third parties. Although we do not believe that we have experienced any material losses to date related to these breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer any such losses in the future. We plan to actively manage the risks within our control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices, and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur information technology is provided by a combination of internal and external services and service providers, and we rely on information technology in many aspects of our business, including internal and external communications, and the management of our accounting, finance, and supply chain functions. Further, our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about customers, suppliers, and employees. As we become more dependent on information technology to conduct our business, and as the number and sophistication of cyberattacks increases, the risks associated with cybersecurity, information security, and data privacy also increase. Failure to maintain effective internal control over our information technology and infrastructure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and/or have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nPreparedness plans pertaining to the physical- and cyber-related aspects of our business have been developed and detail the actions needed in the event of unforeseen events or severe weather. These measures have historically been in place, and such activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective for a particular event that we may experience.\nOur ability to make future strategic decisions regarding our manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal, and economic risks, and to a certain extent may be subject to consents or cooperation from DuPont under the agreements entered into between us and DuPont as part of the Separation. These could adversely affect our ability to execute our future strategic decisions and our results of operations and financial condition.\nOne of the ways we may improve our business is through the expansion or improvement of our facilities. Construction of additions or modifications to facilities involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal, and economic uncertainties that are beyond our control, and are subject to various start-up risks and consent to operate. Difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits, and authorizations from governmental or regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay, jeopardize, or prevent the construction or opening of such facilities. Our expansion or improvement projects may also require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, and financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, these projects may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project or may be negatively impacted by regulatory or other developments relating to the chemicals we use or manufacture. As a result, we may not be able to realize our expected investment return, which could also adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments, we may make strategic decisions regarding our manufacturing operations such as capital improvements to modernize certain units, move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility, discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products, or close or divest all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility, some of which have significant shared services and lease agreements with DuPont. These agreements may adversely impact our ability to make these strategic decisions regarding our manufacturing operations. Further, if such agreements are terminated or revised, we would have to assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations, the closure or divestiture of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility that could result in future charges that could be significant.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, changes in the industrial, economic, political, and social landscapes in which we operate, as well as competition or other factors leading to a reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. We may be required to record a significant non-cash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nIn March 2018, a civil association in Mexico filed a complaint against the government authorities involved in the permitting process of our new Mining Solutions facility under construction in Gomez Palacio, Durango, Mexico. The claimant sought and obtained a suspension from the district judge to stop our construction work. The suspension was subsequently lifted on appeal, and the matter is before the Supreme Court of Mexico. A second similar complaint was filed in September 2019 and, again, a suspension of construction was granted. We have filed an appeal. In the event that the suspension of construction is ultimately upheld, we would incur $26 million of contract termination fees with a third-party services provider. Additionally, at December 31, 2019, we had $144 million long-lived assets under construction at the facility, $7 million of other related prepaid costs, and $51 million of our goodwill assigned to the Mining Solutions reporting unit. While we currently believe these amounts are recoverable, any future assessment that could potentially deem the facility to be impaired would result in a non-cash charge that negatively impacts our results of operations.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur operations could be materially impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure.\nWe currently use an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) software platform that is no longer supported; however, we are able to pay for extended, customer-specific support, which can be costly. We are currently evaluating our options to upgrade or switch this platform. Any systems failure, accident, or security breach could result in significant costs or disruptions to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly, and time-consuming. We may experience challenges integrating any new ERP software platform with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. Any unsuccessful attempt to upgrade or switch our ERP software platform could result in outages, a disruption to our operations and our ability to serve our customers, and/or damage to our reputation.\nHazards associated with chemical manufacturing, storage, containment, and transportation could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage, containment, and transportation of raw materials, products, and wastes. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on us as a whole. While we endeavor to provide adequate protection for the safe-handling of these materials, issues could be created by various events, including unforeseen accidents or defects, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of sabotage, military actions, terrorism, and performance by third parties, and as a result, we could face the following potential hazards:\n\u2022\npiping and storage tank leaks and ruptures;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure;\n\u2022\nemployee exposure to hazardous substances; and,\n\u2022\nchemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.\nThese hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property, contamination of the environment, and damage to natural resources, which could lead to government fines and penalties, remedial obligations, work stoppage injunctions, claims and lawsuits by injured persons, damage to our public reputation and brands, loss of sales and market access, customer dissatisfaction, and diminished product acceptance. If such actions are determined adversely to us or there is an associated economic impact to our business, we may have inadequate insurance or cash flows to offset any associated costs. Such outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and to identify and develop talented personnel to succeed our senior management and other employees.\nOur success depends on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract, retain, identify, and develop such individuals, whether due to technical, geographical, social, or other misalignment, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, if we are unable to effectively plan for the succession of our senior management team, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected, as we may be unable to realize our business strategy. While our ongoing personnel practices identify a succession process for our key employees, including our senior management team, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of this process, the continuity of highly-qualified individuals serving in all of our key positions at particular moments in time, and/or the completeness of any knowledge transfer at the time of succession.\nIn addition, we expect to experience significant turnover at an operations level due to the demographics of our general workforce. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the completeness of any knowledge transfer at the time of departure, or the continuity of key processes and/or internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nOperating as a multi-national corporation presents risks associated with global and regional economic downturns and global capital market conditions as well as risks resulting from changes to regional regulatory requirements (including environmental standards).\nOur business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by global economic conditions, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges, such as tariffs on international trade and a changing financial regulatory environment that could affect the global economy. Such global economic conditions may be further affected by physical risks that stem from a number of root causes, including natural disasters and/or travel-based restrictions that may be driven by geo-political activities, military actions, terrorism, and the spread of pandemics, such as the novel coronavirus.\nThe Chemours Company\nOur customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, shortages in cash flows, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers could experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to supply materials or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us. Because we have significant international operations, there are a large number of currency transactions that result from our international sales, purchases, investments, and borrowings. Also, our effective tax rate may fluctuate because of variability in our geographic mix of earnings, changes in statutory rates, and taxes associated with the repatriation of our non-U.S. earnings. Future weakness in the global economy and failure to manage these risks could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in future periods.\nIn addition to the general risks associated with operating in the global economy, our revenue and profitability are largely dependent on the TiO2 pigment industry and the industries that are the end-users of our fluoroproducts. TiO2 pigment and our fluoroproducts, such as refrigerants and resins, are used in many \u201cquality of life\u201d products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional, and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events, or economic conditions. Such events, which may or may not impact all of our businesses at the same time or to the same degree, are likely to cause a decrease in the demand for our products and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The future profitability of our operations, and cash flows generated by those operations, will also be affected by the available supply of our products in the market. Our future Ti-PureTM demand growth may be below average global GDP growth rates if our sales into developed markets outpace our sales into emerging markets. In addition, because demand for our fluorochemicals is driven in part by industry needs to comply with certain mandated environmental regulations (such as markets for refrigerants and foams with low GWP), changes in, the elimination of, or lack of enforcement of such environmental regulations in the U.S., the EU, or other jurisdictions can also negatively impact demand for such products and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency devaluation could impair our competitiveness.\nDue to our international operations, we transact in many foreign currencies, including, but not limited to, the euro, the Mexican peso, the Chinese yuan, and the Japanese yen. As a result, we are subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net sales and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of local economic crisis, local currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, potentially reducing our margin. For example, depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar has historically negatively impacted our results of operations, and further decline of the euro could affect future periods.\nWe enter into certain of our qualifying foreign currency forward contracts under a cash flow hedge program to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in the euro against the U.S. dollar for forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases for certain of our international subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that any hedging action will lessen the adverse impact of a variation in currency rates. Also, actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. For example, in our Titanium Technologies segment, a substantial portion of our manufacturing is located in the U.S. and Mexico, while our TiO2 pigment is delivered to customers around the world. Furthermore, our ore cost is principally denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, in periods when the U.S. dollar or Mexican peso strengthen against other local currencies, such as the euro, our costs are higher relative to some of our competitors who operate largely outside of the U.S., and the benefits we realize from having lower costs associated with our manufacturing process are reduced, impacting our profitability.\nEffects of price fluctuations in energy and raw materials, our raw materials contracts, and our inability to renew such contracts, could have a significant impact on our earnings.\nOur manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which may be subject to worldwide supply and demand factors, global trade regulations and tariffs, GHG emissions-based regulations, and other factors beyond our control. Variations in the cost of energy, which primarily reflect market prices for oil and natural gas, and for raw materials may significantly affect our operating results from period to period. Additionally, consolidation in the industries providing our raw materials may have an impact on the cost and availability of such materials. To the extent we do not have fixed price contracts with respect to specific raw materials, we have no control over the costs of raw materials and such costs may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems.\nWhen possible, we have purchased, and we plan to continue to purchase, raw materials, including titanium-bearing ores and fluorspar, through negotiated medium-term or long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. To the extent that we have been able to achieve favorable pricing in our existing negotiated long-term contracts, we may not be able to renew such contracts at the current prices, or at all, and this may adversely impact our profitability and cash flows from operations. However, to the extent that the prices of the raw materials that we utilize significantly decline, we may be bound by the terms of our existing long-term contracts and obligated to purchase such raw materials at higher prices as compared to other market participants.\nThe Chemours Company\nWe attempt to offset the effects of higher energy and raw materials costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements, and cost reduction programs. However, the outcome of these efforts is largely determined by existing competitive and economic conditions, and may be subject to a time delay between the increase in our raw materials costs and our ability to increase prices, which could vary significantly depending on the market served. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher energy or raw materials costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn connection with our Separation, we were required to assume, and indemnify DuPont for, certain liabilities. As we may be required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to DuPont, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, DuPont\u2019s obligation to indemnify us for certain liabilities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and DuPont may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation agreement, the employee matters agreement, the tax matters agreement, and the intellectual property cross-license agreement, we entered into with DuPont prior to the Separation, we were required to assume, and indemnify DuPont for, certain liabilities. These indemnification obligations to date have included, among other items, defense costs associated with certain litigation matters as well as certain damages awards, settlement amounts, and penalties. In connection with MDL Settlement described in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we and DuPont entered into an amendment to the separation agreement concerning PFOA costs, the terms of which are also described in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments pursuant to these indemnities, whether relating to PFOA costs or otherwise, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. In addition, in the event that DuPont seeks indemnification for adverse trial rulings or outcomes, these indemnification claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nDisputes with DuPont and others which may arise with respect to indemnification matters, including disputes based on matter of law or contract interpretation, could materially adversely affect us. As described in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have filed a lawsuit against DuPont regarding indemnification matters. As further described in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, multiple lawsuits have been filed by third parties containing allegations that DuPont\u2019s separation of Chemours was fraudulent.\nThird parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities of the DuPont businesses. DuPont has agreed to indemnify us for such liabilities, but such indemnity from DuPont may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and DuPont may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from DuPont any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn connection with our Separation, we were required to enter into numerous Separation-related and commercial agreements with our former parent company, DuPont, which may not reflect optimal or commercially beneficial terms to us.\nCommercial agreements we entered into with DuPont prior to the Separation were formed in the context of the Separation while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were formed, we did not have an independent board of directors or management independent of DuPont. Certain commercial agreements, having long terms and commercially-advantageous cancellation and assignment rights to DuPont, may not include adjustments for changes in industry and market conditions. There is a risk that the pricing and other terms under these agreements may not be commercially beneficial and may not be able to be changed in the future. The terms relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, and obligations, including the provision of products and services and the sharing and operation of property, manufacturing, office, and laboratory sites, and other commercial rights and obligations between us and DuPont.\nOur customers, prospective customers, suppliers, other companies with whom we conduct business, or regulators may need assurances that our financial stability is sufficient to satisfy their respective business or regulatory requirements.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, other companies with whom we conduct business, or regulators may need assurances that our financial stability is sufficient to satisfy their respective business or regulatory requirements, and may require us to provide additional credit support, such as letters of credit or other financial guarantees. Any failure of parties to be satisfied with our financial stability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Chemours Company\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted, and all of our assets are owned, by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating companies and any future subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flows and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flows of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries, and the payment of funds by our operating companies and any future subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur debt is generally the exclusive obligation of The Chemours Company and our guarantor subsidiaries, as described in \u201cNote 20 - Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by non-guarantor subsidiaries, our cash flows and our ability to service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity, are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such non-guarantor subsidiaries. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans, or advances by our non-guarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions, and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings.\nOur subsidiaries are separate legal entities and, except for our guarantor subsidiaries, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available for those amounts, whether by dividends, loans, distributions, or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, our debt. Any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of the outstanding notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary.\nOur failure to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the U.S. and various international jurisdictions could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.\nDoing business on a global basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and those of various international and sub-national jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions, and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), as well as other anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The FCPA, the Bribery Act, and other laws prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees, and agents acting on our behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing, or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. Our global operations may expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, and exclusion from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive, disruptive, and damaging to our reputation. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies and procedures, there can be no guarantee that these policies, procedures, and training will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives in the future. Additionally, we face a risk that our distributors and other business partners may violate the FCPA, the Bribery Act, or similar laws or regulations. Such violations could expose us to FCPA and Bribery Act liability and/or our reputation may potentially be harmed by their violations and resulting sanctions and fines.\nThe Chemours Company\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates and the adoption of tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations. Our tax returns and other tax matters are subject to examination by local tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the taxes owed by us is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFailure to meet some or all of our key financial and non-financial targets could negatively impact the value of our business and adversely affect our stock price.\nFrom time to time, we may announce certain key financial and non-financial targets that are expected to serve as benchmarks for our performance for a given time period, including goals for our future net sales growth, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flows, return on invested capital, corporate responsibility, and/or sustainability. Our failure to meet one or more of these key targets may negatively impact our results of operations, stock price, and stockholder returns. The factors influencing our ability to meet these key targets include, but are not limited to, changes in the global economic environment, changes in our competitive landscape, including our relationships with new or existing customers, our ability to introduce new products, applications, or technologies, our undertaking of an acquisition, joint venture, or other strategic arrangement, the outcome of any new or existing litigation, our failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations, and other factors described within this Item 1A - Risk Factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur current level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, and we could have difficulty fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $4.2 billion of indebtedness. At December 31, 2019, together with the guarantors, we had approximately $1.3 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities, and an $800 million revolving credit facility (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) capacity, which would be senior secured indebtedness, if drawn (collectively, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d). Our current level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have other important consequences on our business, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from capitalizing on business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into certain commercial arrangements because of concerns of counterparty risks; and,\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including on our outstanding notes, depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the outstanding notes, to refinance our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nThe Chemours Company\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the outstanding notes. Failure to successfully restructure or refinance our debt could cause us to default on our debt obligations and would impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations.\nMoreover, in the event of a default of our debt service obligations, the holders of the applicable indebtedness, including holders of our outstanding notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We cannot be certain that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. First, a default in our debt service obligations in respect of the outstanding notes would result in a cross-default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The foregoing would permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and would allow the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to declare all loans immediately due and payable and to institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. Second, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain other agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the outstanding notes, and any event of default or declaration of acceleration under any other of our outstanding indebtedness may also contain a cross-default provision. Any such default, event of default, or declaration of acceleration could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSee \u201cNote 20 - Debt\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nNotwithstanding our current level of indebtedness, we may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured indebtedness (including the $800 million under the Revolving Credit Facility) that would be effectively senior to our outstanding notes. Although the indenture that governs the outstanding notes and the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to enter into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions, including additional secured indebtedness, could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent such new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor would increase.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms.\nOur industry is capital intensive, and we may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, make investments driven by environmental compliance, and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and R&D projects, and the status and timing of these developments, as well as the general availability of capital from debt and/or equity markets. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our failure to maintain the credit ratings on our debt securities, including the outstanding notes, could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense on future indebtedness. We expect the credit rating agencies to periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our overall credit ratings and our debt securities. Any negative rating agency actions could constrain the capital available to us, reduce or eliminate available borrowing to us, and could limit our access to and/or increase the cost of funding our operations. If, as a result, our ability to access capital when needed becomes constrained, our interest costs could increase, which could have material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. As a result, if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or other variable rate debt would increase, even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.3 billion of our outstanding debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at variable interest rates.\nThe Chemours Company\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including the outstanding notes, contain, and the agreements governing future indebtedness and future debt securities may contain, significant restrictive covenants and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, financial maintenance and negative covenants that will limit our operations, including our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictive covenants may limit us, and our restricted subsidiaries, from taking, or give rights to the holders of our indebtedness in the event of the following actions:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness and guaranteeing indebtedness and other obligations;\n\u2022\npaying dividends or making other distributions in respect of, or repurchasing or redeeming, our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmaking acquisitions or other investments;\n\u2022\nprepaying, redeeming, or repurchasing certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nselling or otherwise disposing of assets;\n\u2022\nselling stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincurring liens;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nentering into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions that result in a change of control of us; and,\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging, or selling all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead us to bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency.\nThe Chemours Company\nRisks Related to the Separation\nIf the distribution, in connection with the Separation, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving our common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liability.\nDuPont received a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution in connection with the Separation qualified as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cIRC\u201d). The tax-free nature of the distribution was conditioned on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling, as well as on receipt of a tax opinion, in form and substance acceptable to DuPont, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution would qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the IRC, and certain transactions related to the transfer of assets and liabilities to us in connection with the Separation and distribution would not result in the recognition of any gain or loss to us, DuPont, or our stockholders. The IRS Ruling and the tax opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from us and DuPont, regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters, and the tax opinion relies on the IRS Ruling. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution or such related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were not correct, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nIf the distribution ultimately was determined to be taxable, then a stockholder of DuPont that received shares of our common stock in the distribution would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of DuPont\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any amount that exceeded DuPont\u2019s earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of DuPont stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. DuPont would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of our common stock held by DuPont on the distribution date over DuPont\u2019s tax basis in such shares. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state, and/or local tax law, and/or foreign tax law, we and DuPont could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, and/or local tax law, and/or foreign tax law.\nGenerally, taxes resulting from the failure of the Separation and distribution or certain related transactions to qualify for non-recognition treatment under U.S. federal, state, and/or local tax law, and/or foreign tax law, would be imposed on DuPont or DuPont\u2019s stockholders and, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with DuPont prior to the Separation, DuPont is generally obligated to indemnify us against such taxes to the extent that we may be jointly, severally, or secondarily liable for such taxes. However, under the terms of the tax matters agreement, we are also generally responsible for any taxes imposed on DuPont that arise from the failure of the distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the IRC or the failure of such related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events, or transactions relating to our or our affiliates\u2019 stock, assets, or business, or any breach of our or our affiliates\u2019 representations, covenants, or obligations under the tax matters agreement (or any other agreement we enter into in connection with the Separation and distribution), the materials submitted to the IRS or other governmental authorities in connection with the request for the IRS Ruling or other tax rulings or the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion. Events triggering an indemnification obligation under the agreement include events occurring after the distribution that cause DuPont to recognize a gain under Section 355(e) of the IRC. Such tax amounts could be significant. To the extent we are responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of DuPont.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of DuPont may become our obligations. For example, under the IRC and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of DuPont\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. In connection with the Separation and distribution, we entered into a tax matters agreement with DuPont that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of DuPont\u2019s consolidated tax reporting group between us and DuPont. If DuPont were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nThe Chemours Company\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could become more volatile and investments could lose value.\nThe market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates or our earnings guidance;\n\u2022\nanticipated or actual outcomes or resolutions of legal or other contingencies;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\na change in our dividend or stock repurchase activities;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable rules and regulations and the reputation of our business;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations and domestic and worldwide economic conditions; and,\n\u2022\nother factors described in this Item 1A - Risk Factors, and elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA significant drop or rise in our stock price could expose us to costly and time-consuming litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, resulting in an adverse effect on our business. As further described in \u201cNote 22 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, lawsuits have been filed alleging that Chemours and certain of its officers have violated the Exchange Act of 1934.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing or amount of our dividends and/or our share repurchases, which are subject to a number of uncertainties that may affect the price of our common stock.\nThe declaration, payment, and amount of any dividends, and/or the decision to purchase common stock under our share repurchase programs are subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and, in the context of our financial policy and capital allocation strategy, will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and relevant prospects, our capital requirements and access to capital markets, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, and there can be no assurances that we will continue to pay a dividend or repurchase our common shares in the future.\nThe reduction or elimination of our dividends or share repurchase programs could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Additionally, any repurchases of our common stock will reduce the amount of our common stock outstanding. There can be no assurances that any share repurchase activity will increase stockholder value due to market fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which may reduce the price of our common stock to levels below the repurchase price. Although our share repurchase programs are designed to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could reduce the program\u2019s overall effectiveness.\nA stockholder\u2019s percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nA stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in our common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions, or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may be granting to our directors, officers, and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences, and relative participating, optional, and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nThe Chemours Company\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of the common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe limited ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies (including those resulting from an enlargement of the board of directors) on our board of directors; and,\n\u2022\nthe requirement that stockholders holding at least 80% of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporations Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d). Section 203 of the DGCL provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that (without prior board of directors approval) acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if an acquisition proposal or offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and/or our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nSeveral of the agreements that we have entered into with DuPont require DuPont\u2019s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations, or a change of control of us, under the agreements. The consent rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the IRC. Under the tax matters agreement executed prior to the Separation, we would be required to indemnify DuPont for the tax imposed under Section 355(e) of the IRC resulting from an acquisition or issuance of its stock, even if it did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable. See the risk factor, \u201cIf the distribution, in connection with the Separation, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving our common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liability\u201d for further information.", "PERMNO": 15398, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "CC"}
