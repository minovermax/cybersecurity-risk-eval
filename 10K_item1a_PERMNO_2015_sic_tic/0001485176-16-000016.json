RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER\nFox Chase will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Fox Chase and consequently on Univest. These uncertainties may impair Fox Chase\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated, and could cause customers and others that deal with Fox Chase to seek to change existing business relationships with Fox Chase. Retention of certain employees may be challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Univest. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Univest, Univest\u2019s business following the merger could be harmed. In addition, the merger agreement restricts Fox Chase from taking certain actions until the merger occurs without the consent of Univest. These restrictions may prevent Fox Chase from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus contained in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC by Univest on February 26, 2016 (SEC File No. 333-209759) for a description of the restrictive covenants to which Fox Chase is subject.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively affect Fox Chase.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences, including the fact that Fox Chase\u2019s businesses may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated and Fox Chase\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Fox Chase shareholders cannot be certain that Fox Chase will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration Univest has agreed to provide in the merger.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated and a different business combination is pursued, Fox Chase may be required to pay a termination fee of $10.0 million to Univest under certain circumstances.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Fox Chase.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, Fox Chase will be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe market price of Fox Chase common stock may decline to the extent that the current market prices of its common stock already reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed;\n\u2022\ncosts relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and, in specified circumstances, additional reimbursement and termination fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business operations and the potential disruption to each company\u2019s employees and business relationships during the period before the completion of the merger may make it difficult to regain financial and market positions if the merger does not occur.\nBecause the market price of Univest shares of common stock will fluctuate, Fox Chase shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they may receive.\nUpon completion of the merger, each share of Fox Chase common stock will be converted into the right to receive merger consideration consisting of shares of Univest common stock and/or cash pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, subject to the requirement that 60% of the outstanding shares of Fox Chase common stock be exchanged for shares of Univest common stock. The value of the stock portion of the merger consideration to be received by Fox Chase shareholders is fixed at 0.9731 shares of Univest common stock for each share of Fox Chase common stock. The sale prices for shares of Univest common stock may vary from the sale prices of Univest common stock on the date we announced the merger, on the date the joint proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to Fox Chase shareholders and on the date of the special meeting of the Fox Chase shareholders. Any change in the market price of Univest shares of common stock prior to closing the merger may affect the value of the merger consideration that Fox Chase shareholders will receive upon completion of the merger. Fox Chase is not permitted to resolicit the vote of Fox Chase shareholders solely because of changes in the market price of Univest shares of common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in our respective businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nFox Chase shareholders may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect.\nThe consideration to be received by Fox Chase shareholders in the merger is subject to the requirement that 60% of the shares of Fox Chase common stock is exchanged for Univest common stock and 40% is exchanged for cash. The merger agreement contains proration and allocation procedures to achieve this desired result. If a shareholder elects all cash and the available cash is oversubscribed,\nthen the shareholder will receive a portion of the merger consideration in Univest common stock. If a shareholder elects all stock and the available stock is oversubscribed, then the shareholder will receive a portion of the merger consideration in cash.\nFox Chase shareholders who make elections may be unable to sell their shares in the market pending the completion of the merger.\nFox Chase shareholders may elect to receive cash, stock or mixed consideration in the merger by completing an election form that will be sent under separate cover. Making an election will require that shareholders turn in their Fox Chase stock certificates. This means that during the time between when the election is made and the date the merger is completed, Fox Chase shareholders will be unable to sell their Fox Chase common stock. If the merger is unexpectedly delayed, this period could extend for a significant period of time. Fox Chase shareholders can shorten the period during which they cannot sell their shares by delivering their election shortly before the election deadline. However, elections received after the election deadline will not be accepted or honored.\nLitigation relating to the merger could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as delay and/or enjoin the merger.\nFox Chase has received a letter from attorneys representing a purported shareholder demanding that the Fox Chase board remedy alleged breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the merger. The letter asserts that the proposed transaction undervalues Fox Chase and that Fox Chase\u2019s directors breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly refusing to adequately shop the company and maximize shareholder value. The letter requests that Fox Chase\u2019s board, among other things: (i) undertake all appropriate methods to maximize shareholder value; (ii) revise the merger agreement to eliminate certain deal protection devices; and (iii) refrain from completing the merger.\nA negative outcome in this matter could have a material adverse effect on Fox Chase and Univest if it results in preliminary or permanent injunctive relief or rescission of the merger agreement. Such actions may also create additional uncertainty relating to the merger, and responding to such demands and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management. Neither Fox Chase nor Univest is currently able to predict the outcome of any suit arising out of or relating to the proposed transaction that may be filed in the future. If additional letters or complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, Fox Chase and Univest will not necessarily announce such additional filings.\nFox Chase and Univest could be subject to additional demands or litigation related to the merger, whether or not the merger is consummated. Such actions may create additional uncertainty relating to the merger, and responding to such demands and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcomes of the demand or any subsequent litigation, neither Fox Chase nor Univest believes that the resolution of such demands or any subsequent litigation will have a material adverse effect on its respective financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO FOX CHASE'S OPERATIONS\nWe may be required to make increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge-off loans in the future. Further, our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nFor 2015, we recorded a credit to the provision for loan losses of $995,000 compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.9 million in 2014 and $982,000 in 2013. We recorded net loan recoveries of $827,000 in 2015 compared to net loan charge-offs of $2.7 million in 2014 and $623,000 in 2013. Our non-performing assets decreased to $5.2 million, or 0.46% of total assets and 3.4% of Tier 1 Bank capital, at December 31, 2015 from $6.3 million, or 0.57% of total assets and 4.2% of Tier 1 Bank capital, at December 31, 2014. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, loans that were criticized and classified as either special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss totaled $23.4 million, representing 2.1% of total assets, including nonaccruing loans of $2.5 million. If the economies we operate in and/or the real estate markets weaken, more of our criticized and classified loans may become nonperforming and we may be required to add additional reserves to our allowance for loan losses for these assets as the value of the collateral may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIn evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider numerous quantitative factors, including our historical charge-off experience, loss emergence periods, growth and seasoning of our loan portfolio, changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of and trends in our nonperforming, delinquent and criticized and classified loans. We also consider many qualitative factors, including lending policies and procedures, economic conditions and current general market collateral valuations, which are more subjective and fluid. In addition, we use information about specific borrower situations, including their financial position and estimated collateral values, to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers' abilities to successfully\nexecute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges, the effect of the current and future economic conditions on collateral values and other factors. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual losses may vary from our current estimates.\nOur regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by our regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur emphasis on commercial lending may expose us to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2015, $637.7 million, or 81.9%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. We believe these types of loans represent a greater risk of non-payment and loss and require a commensurately higher loan loss allowance than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the business and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage or consumer loans. Also, many of our multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial business borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan. Further, unlike residential mortgages or multi-family and commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default.\nAssets acquired through foreclosure are carried at values which may not be realized at the ultimate disposition of the underlying assets.\nWe had assets acquired through foreclosure of $2.6 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For 2015, we recorded assets acquired through foreclosure expense of $247,000 compared to $420,000 in 2014 and $5.2 million in 2013, which includes valuation adjustments of $137,000, $305,000 and $5.0 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2015, assets acquired through foreclosure consisted of other real estate owned, which is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell. In periods subsequent to acquisition, each real estate asset is carried at the lower of the fair value of the asset, less estimated selling costs, or the amount at which the asset was initially recorded. The fair value of other real estate owned is determined using appraisals obtained from approved independent appraisers, agreements of sale or letters of intent, where applicable. We believe that our valuation of assets acquired through foreclosure is appropriate as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, we may not recover the respective carrying values at the time of ultimate disposition of the assets, which could result in a loss on the sale of assets acquired through foreclosure, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe unseasoned nature of our commercial loan portfolio may result in changes in estimating collectability, which may lead to additional provisions or charge-offs, which could hurt our profits.\nOur multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios increased $444.8 million, or 230.5%, from $192.9 million at December 31, 2008 to $637.7 million at December 31, 2015. Accordingly, a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio remains unseasoned and does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern from which to judge future collectability. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance. Further, these types of loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred historically with our residential mortgage loan or consumer loan portfolios.\nOur construction loan portfolio may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2015, our construction loan portfolio included commitments totaling $60.8 million, of which $35.8 million was outstanding. In general, construction projects provide for an interest reserve that is utilized to pay the interest for a period of time until the project is expected to produce positive cash flows. It is possible that construction loan borrowers fully utilize their interest reserve before the project is able to generate cash flows. If a borrower has insufficient liquidity to pay interest on such projects, the loan could become impaired and require an increase in the allowance for loan losses, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Our ability to work with a borrower to modify or restructure their existing loan to avoid loss lessens as the loan approaches its maturity date.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent financing and the builder\u2019s ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost\noverruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nOur residential mortgage loans and home equity loans expose us to risk of loss if real estate values decline.\nAt December 31, 2015, $90.3 million, or 11.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, and $14.7 million, or 1.9%, of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. Because of our locations in southern New Jersey, many of the properties securing our residential mortgages are second homes or rental properties. At December 31, 2015, 22.0% of our one- to four-family mortgage loans were secured by second homes and 9.1% were secured by rental properties. These loans generally are considered to be more risky than loans secured by the borrower's permanent residence, as a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty is more likely to make payments on the loan secured by the borrower's primary residence before a vacation home. Additionally, declines in real estate values, which occurred during the most recent recession, may have caused some of our mortgage and home equity loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nA downturn in the local economy or in local real estate values could hurt profits.\nMost of the Bank\u2019s loans are made to borrowers in the Greater Philadelphia area, Cape County and Atlantic County, New Jersey, and the surrounding areas. Tourism and gaming are significant contributors to the economy of Southern New Jersey. While we are not engaged in lending to the gaming industry, some of our borrowers are employed in the gaming industry or have businesses that benefit from the industry. As a result of this concentration, a downturn in the local economy, including declines in the tourism and gaming industries in Southern New Jersey, could cause increases in non-performing loans, which could hurt profits. A downturn in the local economy or a decline in real estate values could increase the amount of non-performing loans and cause residential and commercial mortgage loans to become inadequately collateralized, which could expose the Bank to a greater risk of loss.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, as a result, our net interest income and net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. As of December 31, 2015, our models indicate that we are asset sensitive indicating that our assets will tend to reprice faster than our liabilities, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates decline, the yield we earn on assets will decrease faster than our funding costs, causing our net interest margin to contract.\nChanges in the slope of the \"yield curve\"-or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our assets tend to reprice faster than our liabilities, when the yield curve decreases or flattens, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans.\nOur procedures for managing interest rate risk exposure also involve monitoring exposure of net portfolio value to interest rate increases of as much as 400 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points. We report on an annual basis the impact on net portfolio value of an immediate and parallel increase of 400 basis points in interest rates or a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, the simulations indicated an instantaneous and parallel 400 basis point increase in rates would result in approximately a 22.8% decrease in net portfolio value and an instantaneous and parallel 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in approximately a 0.6% increase in net portfolio value.\nWe also report on an annual basis the impact on net interest income over the next 12 months of an immediate and parallel increase of 400 basis points in interest rates or a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, the simulations indicated an instantaneous and parallel 400 basis point increase in rates would result in approximately a $1.2 million, or 3.5%, increase in net interest income over the next 12 months and an instantaneous and parallel 100 basis point decrease would result in approximately a $1.5 million, or 4.4%, decrease in net interest income over the next 12 months.\nIncreases in mortgage interest rates could have a material adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAt December 31, 2015, we held mortgage related securities available-for-sale with an amortized cost of $121.2 million and a fair value of $121.9 million, resulting in a net unrealized gain of $716,000. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, unrealized gains and temporary unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are classified as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and represent an adjustment to the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity. The fair value of mortgage related\nsecurities tends to increase or decrease based on changes in mortgage interest rates. As mortgage rates decrease, fair value tends to increase and as mortgage rates increase fair value tends to decrease. Increases in mortgage rates could adversely affect the fair value of our mortgage related securities which would reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIf we conclude that the decline in value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security, which could hurt our financial conditions and results of operation.\nWe review individual securities in our investment portfolio quarterly to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary. If the decline in the market value of a security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the credit portion of the impairment is written down through earnings and the non-credit portion is an adjustment to other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio included securities with an amortized cost of $289.3 million and an estimated fair value of $289.6 million. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, $198.0 million of securities had unrealized losses of $2.0 million. Changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and/or prolonged price declines may result in our concluding in future periods that the impairment of these securities is other than temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down these securities to their fair value. Any charges for other-than-temporary impairment would not impact cash flows or liquidity.\nStrong competition within our market areas could reduce our profits.\nWe face intense competition in making loans, attracting deposits and attracting and retaining key employees. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and at times has forced us to offer lower rates on loans and increase rates on deposits, which negatively impacts net interest income. It has also made it more difficult and costly to attract and hire employees with the level of expertise we require. Additional compensation expense increases noninterest expense, reducing net income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. At June 30, 2015, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held less than 1% of total deposits in counties where our offices are located. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Additionally, we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas.\nRegulatory reform may have a material impact on our operations.\nIn 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Act\") was passed, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\n\u2022\nchanges to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022\ncreation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which develops and enforces rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u2022\npotential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022\nchanges to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022\nregulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022\nchanges in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies to be implemented, some but not all of which have been proposed or finalized by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until after full implementation. Certain changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse. Further, we expect that, at a minimum, our operating and compliance costs will continue to increase as a result of new rules and regulations.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Fox Chase Bank and Fox Chase Bancorp. The final rule implemented the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were effective January 1, 2015, and revised the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are: (1) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (3) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules eliminated the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 were grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The rules also established a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement has begun to be phased in effective January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Fox Chase Bank and Fox Chase Bancorp could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, or result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and the FDIC. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Fox Chase Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nBecause of our dependence on information technology, telecommunications systems and third-party service providers, systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology, telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly\ndisclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.", "PERMNO": 91501, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "FXCB"}
