{"cik": "1679063", "company": "Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are affected by risks specific to us as well as factors that affect all businesses operating in a global market. The significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results are set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Annual Report, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and prospects could be seriously harmed. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being harmed in these risk factors will include harm to our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Company:\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, may incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $32.7 million and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a net loss of $34.9 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our expenses exceed our revenue, we may never achieve or maintain profitability and some or all aspects of our business operations may need to be modified or curtailed.\nWe do not have a long operating history on which to evaluate our company.\nOur predecessor, CSS Productions, was formed in December 2014 and we were formed in May 2016 to acquire CSS Productions\u2019 assets in order to create a discrete, focused entity to pursue video content opportunities using the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand. We focused our company in the area of video on demand in 2017 and have a limited history in operating commercial video on demand offerings. A significant portion of our video on demand operations assets was acquired by us from CPE Holdings, Inc in May 2019, and we have only a limited history in controlling and operating such assets. We face all the risks faced by newer companies in the media industry, including significant competition from existing and emerging media producers and distributors, many of which are significantly more established, larger and better financed than our company.\nWe may not realize the advantages we expect from Crackle Plus\nIn May 2019, we consummated a contribution agreement with CPE Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCPEH\u201d), pursuant to which we and CPEH contributed certain assets relating to our respective VOD businesses to our newly formed majority owned subsidiary, Crackle Plus.\nWe may not realize the potential benefits of Crackle Plus as expected. Our inability to successfully integrate and manage Crackle Plus could delay us from pursuing other strategic opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results, and operations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to the costs and expenses of acquiring and integrating the Crackle Plus business. We may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership.\nAdditionally, CPEH has certain protective voting rights in Crackle Plus. Certain actions require supermajority approval of the board of managers of Crackle Plus, including the managers appointed by CPEH. As a result, our investment in Crackle Plus involves risks that are different from the risks involved in our independent operations. These risks include the possibility that CPEH has economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals.\nThe operating agreement between us and CPEH includes a put arrangement with respect to CPEH\u2019s membership interests in Crackle Plus. At certain times and on the terms specified in the operating agreement, CPEH has a put right to cause us to purchase all such membership interests. We may pay the purchase price for CPEH\u2019s membership interests in cash or in shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, at our option. If we are required to purchase CPEH\u2019s membership interests, we could choose to make significant cash payment, or the price of our Series A Preferred Stock held by our other preferred stockholders may be adversely affected.\nAll our tangible and intangible property is pledged to secure existing indebtedness.\nAll of our tangible and intangible property, including accounts receivable and intellectual property, is pledged under a first priority security interest to secure our repayment obligations under indebtedness owed to Patriot Bank, N.A. under our Commercial Loan, as described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Operating and Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - \u201cCommercial Loan.\u201d In the event the holder of such indebtedness takes action with respect to our assets in connection with any default under the Commercial Loan, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nIf our efforts to attract and retain VOD viewers are not successful, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on attracting viewers, retaining them on our VOD service and ultimately monetizing our VOD services and content offerings. As such, we are seeking to expand our viewer base and increase the number of hours that are streamed across our platforms to create additional revenue opportunities. To attract and retain viewers, we need to be able to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our viewers access to the content they enjoy on terms that they accept. Effective monetization may require us to continue to update the features and functionality of our VOD offerings for viewers and advertisers.\nOur ability to attract viewers will depend in part on our ability to effectively market our services, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors as compared to our service will determine our ability to attract and retain viewers. Competitors include other streaming entertainment providers, including those that provide AVOD and SVOD offerings, and other direct-to-consumer video distributors and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our viewers could choose in their moments of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service offerings to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain consumers. In addition, many of our consumers originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing viewers. If we do not grow as expected, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing viewers and attracting new viewers, our business may be adversely affected.\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\nThe market for entertainment video is also subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, and ad-supported models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet-based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from content suppliers and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\nOur long-term results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on the commercial success of our VOD platforms as well as successful monetization of our video content in other ways and the continued strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand.\nVideo streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth and profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our VOD platforms and content offerings are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access, the quality of broadband content delivery, the quality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for viewers relative to other sources of content, as well as the quality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms. These technologies, products and content offerings continue to emerge and evolve. In addition, many advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising, such as linear TV, radio and print. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of digital advertising, and on advertisers increasing their spend on such advertising. We cannot be certain that they will do so. If advertisers do not perceive meaningful benefits of digital advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, monetization of content that we produce and acquire from sources other than our AVOD network is an essential element of our strategy. Our ability in the long-term to obtain sponsorships, licensing arrangements, co-productions and tax credits and to distribute our original programming and acquired video content will depend, in part, upon the commercial success of the content that we initially produce and distribute and, in part, on the continued strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand. We cannot ensure that we will produce, acquire, and distribute successful content. The continued strength of the brand will be affected in large part by the operations of CSS and its other business operations, none of which we control. CSS utilizes the brand through its other subsidiaries for various commercial purposes, including the sale of books (including educational curriculum products), pet foods and other consumer products. Negative publicity relating to CSS or its other subsidiaries or the brand, or any diminution in the perception of the brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will manage the production and distribution of all of our video content successfully, that all or any portion of our video content will be met with critical acclaim or will be embraced by audiences on a one-time or repeated basis, or that the strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand will not diminish over time.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our VOD services\nOur AVOD platforms generate revenue primarily from digital advertising and audience development campaigns that run across our streaming platform and from content distribution services. Our ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our viewers and to increase our platform\u2019s value to advertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or prevented by a number of factors. Viewers may decide to opt out or restrict\nour ability to collect personal viewing data or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in our revenue from advertising, our efforts to monetize our streaming platform through the distribution of AVOD content are still developing and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. This means of monetization will require us to continue to attract advertising dollars to our streaming platform as well as deliver AVOD content that appeals to viewers. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nIn addition, with the recent spread of the coronavirus throughout the United States and the rest of the world, companies advertising plans and amounts available for advertising may be significantly restricted or discontinued which could also impact our ability to monetize our AVOD platform.\nOur reliance on third parties for content, production and distribution could limit our control over the quality of the finished video content.\nWe currently have limited production capabilities and are reliant on relationships with third parties for much of these capabilities. Working with third parties is an integral part of our strategy to produce video content on a cost-efficient basis, and our reliance on such third parties could lessen the control we have over the projects. Should the third-party producers we rely upon not produce completed projects to the standards we expect and desire, critical and audience acceptance of such projects could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to produce and distribute future projects. Further, we cannot be assured of entering into favorable agreements with such third-party producers on economically favorable terms or on terms that provide us with satisfactory intellectual property rights in the completed projects.\nA limited number of content publishers account for a significant portion of the hours streamed on our Crackle Plus and other streaming platforms. If, for any reason, our relationships with these publishers worsen, our streaming hours, active viewers, and advertising revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed. As of year-end 2019 Sony provides slightly over 50% of the content on our Crackle Plus network. If for any reason Sony did not provide such content in the future the business could be adversely affected.\nAn integral part of our strategy is to initially minimize our production, content acquisition and distribution costs by utilizing funding sources provided by others, however, such sources may not be readily available.\nThe production acquisition and distribution of video content can require a significant amount of capital. As part of our strategy, we seek to fund the production, content acquisition, and distribution of our video content through co-productions, tax credits, upfront fees from sponsors, licensors, broadcasters, cable and satellite outlets and other producers and distributors, as well as through other initiatives. Such funding from the aforementioned sources or other sources may not be available on attractive terms or at all, as and when we need such funding. To the extent we are not able to secure agreements of this sort, we may need to curtail the amount of video content being produced or acquired by us or use our operating or other funds to pay for such video content, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nDue to the effect of the coronavirus, the interest and ability of sponsors to enter into and invest in co-production agreements may not be attractive or considered at this time.\nAs we grow, we may seek to fund and produce more of our video content directly, subjecting us to significant additional risks.\nOur current strategy of funding the production, acquisition, and distribution of our video content through the payment of upfront fees by third parties may limit the backend return to us. If we should determine to use our own funds to produce, acquire, and distribute more of our video content in order to capture greater backend returns, we would face significant additional risks, such as the need to internally advance funds ahead of revenue generation and cost recoupment and the need to divert some of our resources and efforts away from other operations. In order to reduce these risks, we may determine to raise additional equity or incur additional indebtedness. In such event, our stockholders and our company will be subjected to the risks associated with issuing more of our shares or increasing our debt obligations.\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide content depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. If studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to provide content will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase.\nCertain conflicts of interest may arise between us and our affiliated companies and we have waived certain rights with respect thereto.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes a provision stating that we renounce any interest or expectancy in any business opportunities that are presented to us or our officers, directors or stockholders or affiliates thereof, including but not limited to CSS Productions and its affiliates (collectively, the \u201cCSS Companies\u201d), except as may be set forth in any written agreement between us and any of the CSS Companies (such as the CSS License Agreement under which CSS has agreed that all video content operations shall be conducted only through CSS Entertainment). This provision also states that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, our officers, directors and employees shall not be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of our activities or any activities of any of the CSS Companies. As a result of these provisions, there may be conflicts of interest among us and our officers, directors, stockholders or their affiliates, including the CSS Companies, relating to business opportunities, and we have waived our right to monetary damages in the event of any such conflict.\nWe are required to make continuing payments to our affiliates, which may reduce our cash flow and profits.\nWe are required to make significant payments to our affiliates as described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Affiliate Resources and Obligations - CSS Management Agreement\u201d, \u201cCSS License Agreement\u201d and described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. Accordingly, in the aggregate, 10% of our net revenue will be paid to our affiliates on a continuous basis and will not be otherwise available to us.\nIf a project we are producing incurs substantial budget overruns, we may have to seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production or fund the overrun ourselves.\nIf a production we are funding incurs substantial budget overruns, we may have to seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production or fund the overrun ourselves. We cannot be certain that any required financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will be able to recoup the costs of overruns. Increased costs incurred with respect to a project may result in the production not being ready for release at the intended time, which could cause a decline in the commercial performance of the project. Budget overruns could also prevent a project from being completed or released at all.\nWe are subject to risks associated with possible acquisitions, business combinations, or joint ventures.\nWe are actively pursuing discussions and activities with respect to possible acquisitions, sale of assets, business combinations, or joint ventures intended to complement or expand our business, some of which may be significant transactions for us. We may not realize the anticipated benefit from any of the transactions we pursue. Regardless of whether we consummate any such transaction, the negotiation of a potential transaction could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of management\u2019s time and resources.\nIntegrating any business that we acquire may be distracting to our management and disruptive to our business and may result in significant costs to us. We could face several challenges in the consolidation and integration of information technology, accounting systems, personnel and operations. Any such transaction could also result in impairment of\ngoodwill and other intangibles, development write-offs and other related expenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur operating results may fluctuate.\nOur operating results are dependent, in part, on management\u2019s estimates of revenue to be earned over the life of a project. We will regularly review and revise our revenue estimates. This review may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the video content asset to its estimated realizable value. Results of operations in future years depend upon our amortization of our video content costs. Periodic adjustments in amortization rates may significantly affect these results. Further, as many of our third-party relationships will be on a project-by-project basis, the profits, if any, generated from various projects will fluctuate based on the terms of the agreements between us and our third-party producers and distributors.\nVariations in our quarterly and year-end operating results are difficult to predict and our income and cash flows may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which may impact our board of directors\u2019 willingness or legal ability to declare a monthly dividend. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our Common Stock and our Series A preferred stock could decline substantially. Specific factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u00b7\ndemand and pricing for our products and services;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of competing products;\n\u00b7\nour operating expenses which fluctuate due to growth of our business;\n\u00b7\ntiming and popularity of new video content offerings and changes in viewing habits or the emergence of new content distribution platforms; and\n\u00b7\nvariable sales cycle and implementation periods for content and services.\nAs a result of the foregoing and other factors, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period.\nDistributors\u2019 failure to promote our video content could adversely affect our revenue and could adversely affect our business results.\nWe will not always control the timing and way in which our licensed distributors distribute our video content offerings. However, their decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support are important in determining our success. Any decision by those distributors not to distribute or promote our video content or to promote our competitors\u2019 video content to a greater extent than they promote our content could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are smaller and less diversified than many of our competitors.\nMany of the producers and studios with which we compete are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks, cable channels and other diversified companies such as Amazon, which can provide both the means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties as well as for actors, and other personnel required for production. The resources of the major producers and studios may also give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including video content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring.\nWe face risks from doing business internationally.\nWe intend to increase the distribution of our video content outside the U.S. and thereby derive significant revenue in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nlaws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;\n\u00b7\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws regulating interactions and dealings with foreign government officials;\n\u00b7\nchanges in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on video content;\n\u00b7\ndiffering cultural tastes and attitudes;\n\u00b7\ndiffering and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws;\n\u00b7\ndiffering degrees of protection for intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nfinancial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign television markets;\n\u00b7\nthe instability of foreign economies and governments;\n\u00b7\nfluctuating foreign exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nthe spread of communicable diseases in such jurisdictions, which may impact business in such jurisdictions; and\n\u00b7\nwar and acts of terrorism.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenue from non-U.S. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property relating to our video content and the protection of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand. We protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and media. Under the terms of the CSS License Agreement, CSS has the primary right to take actions to protect the brand, and, if it does not, and we reasonably deem any infringement thereof is materially harmful to our business, we may elect to seek action to protect the brand ourselves. Although in the former case, we would equitably share in any recovery, and in the latter case, we would retain the entirety of any recovery, should CSS determine not to prosecute infringement of the brand, we could be materially harmed and could incur substantial cost in prosecuting an infringement of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.\nIt is possible that others may claim from time to time that our productions and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed content, stories, characters and other entertainment or intellectual property. Although CSS is obligated to indemnify us for claims related to our use of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand in accordance with the CSS License Agreement, we could face lawsuits\nwith respect to claims relating thereto. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business involves risks of liability claims for video content, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a producer and distributor of video content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of video content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nPiracy of video content may harm our business.\nVideo content piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia, and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of video content into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies of video content on DVDs, Blu-ray discs, from pay-per-view through set-top boxes and other devices and through unlicensed broadcasts on free television and the internet. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of our video content could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny significant disruption in the computer systems of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our viewers is dependent upon the reliable performance of the computer systems of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm these systems. Interruptions in these systems or to the internet in general, could make our content unavailable or impair our ability to deliver such content.\nOur online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.\nIn addition to our websites, we use third-party applications, websites, and social media platforms to promote our video content offerings and engage consumers, as well as monitor and collect certain information about consumers. There are a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual\u2019s personally identifiable information. The United States is seeing the adoption of state-level laws governing individual privacy. This includes the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws governing individual privacy, such as the recent adoption of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and some of which are more restrictive than similar United States laws. If our online activities were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations that limit our ability to collect, transfer, and use data, we could be subject to litigation from both private rights of action, class action lawsuits, and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties. Internationally, we may become subject to evolving, additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the way we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses.\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the way we currently conduct our business. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional\nburdens on us such as recent adoption of the EU\u2019s GDPR. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our operations.\nIf we experience rapid growth, we may not manage our growth effectively, execute our business plan as proposed or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe anticipate continuing to grow our business and operations rapidly. Our growth strategy includes organic initiatives and acquisitions. Such growth could place a significant strain on the management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure we utilize, a portion of which is made available to us by our affiliates under the CSS Management Agreement. Our long-term success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively, obtain the necessary support and resources under the CSS Management Agreement and grow our own internal resources as required, including internal management and staff personnel. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we also will need to increase our internal operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in producing our video content, declines in overall project quality and increases in costs. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur exclusive license to use the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand could be terminated in certain circumstances.\nWe do not own the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand or any other Chicken Soup for the Soul-related assets (including books), other than those assets transferred to us under the CSS Contribution Agreement. The Brand is licensed to us by CSS under the terms of the CSS License Agreement. CSS controls the Brand, and the continued integrity and strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand will depend in large part on the efforts and businesses of CSS and how the brand is used, promoted and protected by CSS, which will be outside of the immediate control of our company. Although the license granted to us under the CSS License Agreement is perpetual, there are certain circumstances in which it may be terminated by CSS, including our breach of the CSS License Agreement.\nWe may not be able to realize the entire book value of goodwill and other intangible assets from the formation of Crackle Plus and other acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have $21.4 million of goodwill and $47.6 million of net intangible assets, primarily related to the formation of Crackle Plus and other acquisitions. We assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant. If the book value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. If we determine that goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims against us relating to any acquisition or business combination may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nThere may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition or business combination that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally may have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may require and not be able to obtain additional funding to meet increased capital needs after an acquisition.\nOur ability to grow through acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures and our ability to fund our operating expenses after one or more acquisitions may depend upon our ability to obtain funds through equity financing, debt\nfinancing (including credit facilities) or the sale or syndication of some or all of our interests in certain projects or other assets or businesses. If we do not have access to such financing arrangements, and if other funds do not become available on terms acceptable to us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur success depends on our management and relationships with our affiliated companies.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our management personnel and key employees, including production and creative personnel, made available to us through the CSS Management Agreement. The loss of the services of such persons or the resources supplied to us by our affiliated companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nTo be successful, we need to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel. Competition for the caliber of talent required to produce and distribute our video content continues to increase. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training and retaining such personnel in the future. If we were unable to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel in the future, such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of any year.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. Any inability to raise additional capital as and when we need it, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nSince our content is digitally stored and distributed online, and we accept online payments for various subscription services, we face numerous cybersecurity risks.\nWe utilize information technology systems, including third-party hosted servers and cloud-based servers, to host our digital content, as well as to keep business, financial, and corporate records, communicate internally and externally, and operate other critical functions. If any of our internal systems or the systems of our third-party providers are compromised due to computer virus, unauthorized access, malware, and the like, then sensitive documents could be exposed or deleted, and our ability to conduct business could be impaired.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to our systems, computer viruses or other malicious code, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing, SQL injection attacks, human error, or other events that result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of sensitive information or assets. Cyber incidents can be caused by various persons or groups, including disgruntled employees and vendors, activists, organized crime groups, and state-sponsored and individual hackers. Cyber incidents can also be caused or aggravated by natural events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, and telecommunications failures.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, or other systems failures. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber-attacks. In addition to operational and business consequences, if our cybersecurity is breached, we could be held liable to our customers or other parties in regulatory or other actions, and we may be exposed to reputation damages and loss of trust and business. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, fines, and negative publicity.\nCertain information relating to our customers, including personally identifiable information and credit card numbers, is collected and maintained by us, or by third parties that do business with us or facilitate our business activities. This information is maintained for a period of time for various business purposes, including maintaining records of customer preferences to enhance our customer service and for billing, marketing, and promotional purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers and our employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding. Privacy regulation is an evolving area and compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to service our customers and market our properties and services.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, landslides, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, hailstorms, explosions, climate events or weather patterns and pandemic health events (such as the recent pandemic spread of the novel corona virus known as COVID-19 virus, duration and full effects of which ae still uncertain), as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions, cyber-terrorism, explosions and biological, chemical or radiological events. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our partners and counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\nThe global and national impact of COVID-19 could be immense and the length of the pandemic and its ultimate economic and human toll cannot yet be determined. There is significant uncertainty relating to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business. COVID-19 could cause increases in the viewership of our advertising-based VODs as consumers stay home more and look for cost-efficient sources of entertainment. Conversely, viewership could be drawn away from our VOD offerings as people address larger concerns in their lives or spend more of their viewing time watching news sources or if we begin to experience any unexpected broadband outages or other issues that adversely affect viewers\u2019 ability to gain access to the platform from time to time. While our employees currently have the ability and are encouraged to work remotely, such measures may have a substantial impact on employee attendance or productivity, which, along with the possibility of employees\u2019 illness, may adversely affect our operations. The global spread of COVID-19 also has created significant volatility and uncertainty in financial markets. If such volatility and uncertainty persist, and we need to access additional banking sources or other sources of financing or capital, we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Additionally, in response to the pandemic, governments and the private sector have taken (and may take additional) drastic measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, any of which could ultimately hamper the economy generally or business specifically.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock:\nOur chairman and chief executive officer effectively controls our company.\nWe have two classes of common stock - Class A common stock, each share of which entitles the holder thereof to one vote on any matter submitted to our stockholders, and Class B common stock, each share of which entitles the holder thereof to ten votes on any matter submitted to our stockholders. Our chairman and chief executive officer, William J. Rouhana, Jr., has control over the vast majority of all the outstanding voting power as represented by our outstanding Class B and Class A common stock and effectively controls CSS Holdings and CSS, which controls CSS Productions, and, in turn, our company. Further, our bylaws provide that any member of our board may be removed with or without cause by the majority of our outstanding voting power, thus Mr. Rouhana exerts significant control over our board. This concentration of ownership and decision making may make it more difficult for other stockholders to effect substantial changes in our company and may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of our company.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities in the future, whether to complete any acquisition, a business combination or to raise additional funds, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and might cause a change in control of our ownership.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 70 million shares of Class A common stock, par value $.0001 per share, 20 million shares of Class B common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share, of which 4,300,000 shares have been designated 9.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A preferred stock\u201d). As of the date of this Annual Report, we have 65,814,315 authorized but unissued shares of our Class A common stock remaining available for issuance, 12,186,062 authorized but unissued shares of our Class B common stock remaining available for issuance and 8,400,998 authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock remaining available for issuance immediately after the offering. We also may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, or a combination of common and preferred stock, to raise additional funds or in connection with any acquisition or business combination in the future.\nAdditionally, under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, we issued to CPEH warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4 million shares of our Class A common stock, and we may be required to issue to up to 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock as reimbursement for expenses in connection with the creation of the joint venture and up to an aggregate of 1,600,000 shares of Series A preferred stock in the event that Crackle elects to exchange Crackle\u2019s membership interest in the joint venture in 12 to 18 months.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have outstanding Class W warrants to purchase an aggregate of 678,822 shares of Class A common stock, Class Z warrants to purchase an aggregate of 130,618 shares of Class A common stock, and we issued warrants to CPEH to purchase an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. The sale, or even the possibility of sale, of warrants or the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future public financing. Furthermore, we might issue warrants or other securities convertible or exchangeable for shares of common stock in the future in order to raise funds or to effect acquisitions or business combinations. If and to the extent our warrants are exercised, or we issue additional securities to raise funds or consummate any acquisition or business combination, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe currently do not plan to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nThe payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be dependent upon our revenue and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition, our obligation to pay dividends on our Series A preferred stock, as well as the limitations on dividends and distributions that exist under our lending agreement, the laws and regulations of the State of Delaware and will be within the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, any gain you may realize on our common stock (including shares of common stock obtained upon exercise of our warrants) may result solely from the appreciation of such shares.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on the Series A preferred stock if we fall out of compliance with our loan covenants and are prohibited by our bank lender from paying dividends.\nOur Commercial Loan with Patriot Bank, N.A. requires us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio. Related to this obligation, the Commercial Loan contains a negative covenant that restricts our ability to make dividend payments and other distributions and payments to stockholders and certain other people if such payments, distributions or expenditures would result in an event of default under the Commercial Loan or any other indebtedness, or would exceed our net earnings in excess of its debt service obligations. In particular, the Commercial Loan requires us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.0. In the event we do not meet the covenant in any period we have a 90 day cure period. The Company was in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe must adhere to prescribed legal requirements and have sufficient cash in order to be able to pay dividends on our Series A preferred stock.\nIn accordance with Section 170 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, we may only declare and pay cash dividends on the Series A preferred stock if we have either net profits during the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year, or a \u201csurplus\u201d, meaning the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital. We can provide no assurance that we will satisfy such requirements in any given year. Further, even if we have the legal ability to declare a dividend, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A preferred stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described herein actually occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on the Series A preferred stock. As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding obligation is $324,757. For the period ending December 31, 2019, our scheduled dividend payments totaled $3,304,947.\nIf our securities become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may have trouble in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIf at any time our securities become subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Exchange Act our securities could be adversely affected. Typically, securities trading under a market price of $5.00 per share and that do not meet\ncertain exceptions, such as national market listing or annual revenue criteria, are subject to the penny stock rules. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:\n\u00b7\nmake a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n\u00b7\nreceive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to sale;\n\u00b7\nprovide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents which identify certain risks associated with investing in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and which describe the market for these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as well as a purchaser\u2019s legal remedies; and\n\u00b7\nobtain a signed and dated acknowledgment from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d can be completed.\nIf our securities become subject to these rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our securities may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to sell our securities.\nNasdaq could delist our Class A common stock from quotation on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to sell and purchase our shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Class A common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange. If our Class A common stock is not listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange at any time after the date hereof, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for our Class A common stock;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity with respect to our Class A common stock;\n\u00b7\nour Series A preferred stock would be required to meet more stringent listing requirements as a \u201cprimary equity security\u201d;\n\u00b7\na determination that our Class A common stock is \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf Nasdaq delists the Series A preferred stock, investors\u2019 ability to make trades in the Series A preferred stock could be limited.\nOur Series A preferred stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cCSSEP.\u201d We cannot assure you that the Series A preferred stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market in the future. In order to continue listing the Series A preferred stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, we must maintain certain financial, distribution, and share price levels. Generally, this means having a minimum number of publicly held shares of Series A preferred stock (generally 100,000 shares), a minimum market value (generally $1,000,000) and a minimum number of holders (generally 100 public holders). If our Class A common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, the Series A preferred stock would be required to meet the more stringent initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market for a Primary Equity Security, including a minimum number of publicly held shares of Series A preferred stock (generally 1,100,000 shares) and a minimum number of holders (generally 400 public holders). If we are unable to meet these standards and the Series A preferred stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, we may apply to list our Series A preferred stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are also unable to meet the listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may apply to have our Series A preferred stock quoted by OTC Markets. If we are unable to maintain listing for the Series A preferred stock, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A preferred stock will be limited and the market value of the Series A preferred stock will likely be materially adversely affected. Moreover, since the Series A preferred stock has no stated maturity date, investors may be forced to hold shares of the Series A preferred stock\nindefinitely while receiving stated dividends thereon when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and paid by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation value thereof.\nThe Series A preferred stock ranks junior to all our indebtedness and other liabilities.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A preferred stock only after all our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A preferred stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A preferred stock. Also, the Series A preferred stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series A preferred stock.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A preferred stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, our total liabilities (excluding contingent consideration) equaled approximately $76.6 million, including approximately $15 million owed under our Commercial Loan and $5 million owed under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all the Series A preferred stock then outstanding.\nThe market for our Series A preferred stock may not provide investors with adequate liquidity.\nLiquidity of the market for the Series A preferred stock depends on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, our financial condition and operating results, the number of holders of the Series A preferred stock, the market for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Series A preferred stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will maintain a trading market in our Series A preferred stock, or how liquid that market will be. If an active market is not maintained, investors may have difficulty selling shares of our Series A preferred stock.\nWe are generally restricted from issuing shares of other series of preferred stock that rank senior the Series A preferred stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation or voting rights, but may do so with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series A preferred stock and, further, no such consent is required for the issuance of additional series of preferred stock ranking pari passu with the Series A preferred stock.\nUnder the Certificate of Designations of our Series A preferred stock, we are allowed to issue shares of other series of preferred stock that rank above the Series A preferred stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, only with the approval of the holders of at least 66.67% of the outstanding Series A preferred stock. Additionally, agreements that we have entered into with CPE Holdings, Inc. limit our ability to issue shares of other series of preferred stock that rank above the Series A preferred stock as to payments, distributions, or rights on liquidation, and we are not permitted to issue any shares of Series A preferred stock at a per share price below the stated value of the Series A preferred stock, which is $25.00 per share. However, we are allowed to issue additional shares of Series A preferred stock and/or additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to the Series A preferred stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation or winding up of our affairs without first obtaining the approval of the holders of our Series A preferred stock or obtaining the approval of CPE Holdings, Inc. The issuance of additional shares of Series A preferred stock and/or additional series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the Series A preferred stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments on the Series A preferred stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series A preferred stock outstanding and other classes or series of stock with equal or senior priority with respect to dividends. Future issuances and sales of senior or pari passu preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for the Series A preferred stock and our Class A common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.\nMarket interest rates may materially and adversely affect the value of the Series A preferred stock.\nOne of the factors that will influence the price of the Series A preferred stock is the dividend yield on the Series A preferred stock (as a percentage of the market price of the Series A preferred stock) relative to market interest rates. Increases in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of the Series A preferred stock to expect a higher dividend yield (and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for dividend payments). Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series A preferred stock to materially decrease.\nHolders of the Series A preferred stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d\nDistributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the Series A preferred stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders of the Series A preferred stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d only if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additionally, we may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series A preferred stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends, U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d If any distributions on the Series A preferred stock with respect to any fiscal year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that the market value of the Series A preferred stock might decline.\nA reduction in the credit rating of our Series A preferred stock could adversely affect the pricing and liquidity of such stock.\nAny downward revision or withdrawal of the credit rating on our Series A preferred stock could materially adversely affect market confidence in such stock and could cause material decreases in the market price of such stock and could diminish market liquidity. Egan-Jones has initially rated our Series A preferred stock as BBB(-). Neither Egan-Jones nor any other agency is under any obligation to maintain any rating assigned to our Series A preferred stock and such rating could be revised downward or withdrawn at any time for reasons of general market changes or changes in our financial condition or for no reason at all.\nA reduction in the credit rating of our Series A preferred stock could adversely affect our ability to borrow from other sources.\nOur borrowing costs and our access to sources of debt financing could be significantly affected by any public credit rating applicable to us or our securities. Ratings, such as that initially assigned by Egan-Jones to our Series A preferred stock, can be reduced or withdrawn at any time, giving rise to negative credit implications with respect to our company. A reduction in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. This, in turn, could reduce our earnings and adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe may redeem the Series A preferred stock.\nCommencing on June 27, 2023, we may, at our option, redeem the Series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. Also, upon the occurrence of a change of control prior to June 27, 2023, we may, at our option, redeem the Series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurred. We may have an incentive to redeem the Series A preferred stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on the Series A preferred stock. If we redeem the Series A preferred stock, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A preferred stock, the shares of Series A preferred stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.\nA holder of Series A preferred stock has extremely limited voting rights.\nThe voting rights for a holder of Series A preferred stock are limited. Our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class and are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights. Mr. Rouhana, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, beneficially owns the vast majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Rouhana exercises a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without his support, which in turn could reduce the price of our Series A preferred stock.\nVoting rights for holders of the Series A preferred stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect, voting together with the holders of any other series of our preferred stock having similar voting rights, two additional directors to our board of directors, subject to certain limitations in the event that eighteen monthly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Series A preferred stock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our certificate of incorporation, including the certificate of designations relating to the Series A preferred stock, that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of Series A preferred stock or authorize, increase or create additional classes or series of our capital stock that are senior to the Series A preferred stock.\nThe Series A preferred stock is not convertible into Class A common stock, including in the event of a change of control, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of the Class A common stock increases.\nThe Series A preferred stock is not convertible into shares of Class A common stock and earns dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our Class A common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the market price of our Series A preferred stock. The market value of the Series A preferred stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series A preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 16883, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "CSSE"}
