{"cik": "1629261", "company": "Long Island Iced Tea Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\tRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources, including Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and Arizona Beverage Company. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. We also compete against a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers. Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales. As a result, we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing, advertising and product innovation. Any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, trends, health concerns and other factors.\nConsumers\u2019 preferences can change due to a variety of factors, including aging of the population, social trends, negative publicity, economic downturn or other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences, then quickly develop new products in response, our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences, and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes, either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nCosts for our raw materials may increase substantially.\nThe principal raw materials we use in our business are bottles, caps, labels, packaging materials, tea essence and tea base, sugar, natural flavors and other sweeteners, juice, electricity, fuel and water. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially. We expect these increases to continue to exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. We presently do not mitigate our exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials through the use of forward contracts, pricing agreements or other hedging arrangements.\nCertain raw materials we use are available from a limited number of suppliers and shortages could occur.\nSome raw materials we use, such as bottles, caps, labels, and other ingredients, such as tea essence and tea base, sugar, natural flavors and other sweeteners, and juice, are available from only a few suppliers. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers\u2019 financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.\nSubstantial disruption to production at our third party beverage co-packing facilities and our storage facilities could occur.\nA disruption in production at our third party beverage co-packing facility could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other storage facilities or those of our suppliers, co-packers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nOur products may not meet health and safety standards or could become contaminated.\nWe take great care in ensuring the quality and safety in the manufacture of our products. However, our products could still otherwise become contaminated. A contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-K.\nWeather and climate changes could adversely affect our business.\nUnseasonable or unusual weather or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials, energy and fuel, and demand for our products. Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.\nFluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income. Historically, sales during the second and third fiscal quarters have generally been the highest. Any factors that harm our second or third quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\nIn order to prepare for our peak selling season, we must produce and keep in stock more inventory than we would carry at other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak selling season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit.\nCurrent global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and result of operations.\nDisruptions in the current global credit and financial markets in the past several years have included diminished liquidity and credit availability, a decline in consumer confidence, a decline in economic growth, an increased unemployment rate and uncertainty about economic stability. While certain of these negative trends have reversed in recent years, there can be no assurance that there will not be renewed deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Any adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions.\nWe depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales.\nFood and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating. Consolidation has resulted in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we, and our bottlers and distributors, do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers that we service primarily through our distributors make up a significant percentage of our products\u2019 retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. We also sell directly to certain retail accounts, including Costco, and to the distribution facilities of such retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to Wakefern Food Corp. represented approximately 10% of our net sales. While sales to Costco diminished in 2015, sales to Costco made up a substantial portion of our sales during 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to Costco represented approximately 6% of our sales, while such sales represented 32% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2014. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe do not have registered ownership of our trade name and our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property, including termination of distribution rights, could harm our business.\nWe possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes our logo, Long Island Iced Tea, The Original Long Island Brand, and ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. However, we do not currently have registered ownership of the trademark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d and \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d as described below and elsewhere herein. We and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. Our business is also highly dependent upon our distribution rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, including the right to our trade name and logo, our brands, products and business could be harmed and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe initially filed for the trademark of \u201cLong Island Brand Iced Tea\u201d on August 28, 2012. We filed for the trademark of \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d on July 23, 2013. Both applications encountered resistance to registration as a result of the existence of the mark \u201cLong Island\u201d for \u201ciced tea.\u201d We determined that the mark \u201cLong Island\u201d for \u201ciced tea\u201d had been abandoned and filed a petition to cancel the registration of this mark with the USPTO. In January 2015, this petition was granted and the mark for \u201cLong Island\u201d for \u201ciced tea\u201d was cancelled. Accordingly, we intend to petition for the mark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d to be placed on the supplemental registry. If this second petition is successful, we will be able to use the \u201c\u00ae\u201d symbol to notify others that its mark is federally registered and may sue for infringement of its mark in federal court. Upon completion of this second petition, we plan to file for placement on the primary register. However, even though the cancellation petition was successful, we still may not be able to obtain registered ownership of the mark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d if the USPTO determines that the mark is generic or misdescriptive (due to the connotation that the beverages contain alcohol). The USPTO raised concerns over these two issues in the initial applications.\nIn addition, we have filed trademark applications for \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d as a standard character mark and as a stylized mark, which applications are pending review by the USPTO. The applications are for use of the trademarks with iced tea, tea based products, juices, water, beverages and other similar products. LIBB also plans to file for stylized marks protecting certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d (standard character mark and stylized mark), the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded the company the opportunity to produce evidence to establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. There can be no assurance that the USPTO will approve these applications.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,260,770 of total indebtedness (comprised primarily of our $1,091,571 of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, which bears interest at the prime rate plus 7.5%). In addition, in March 2016, the Lenders approved an increase of $500,000 in the Available Amount under the Credit Agreement and approved advances under the Credit Agreement in the same amount, of which $250,000 will be advanced no later than March 24, 2016 and the remaining $250,000 will be advanced no later than April 22, 2016. Although we may pay interest that accrues on the loans under the Credit Agreement by capitalizing the interest and adding it to the principal balance of such loans, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt in future years. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks for us could intensify.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences. In particular, it could:\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit, along with the restrictive covenants of our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Credit Agreement and the other agreement governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Agreement or such other agreements, including pursuant to the cross-default provisions of such agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore, our lenders under the Credit Agreement could foreclose on their security interests in our assets, including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend the Financing Agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nThe loss of the services of our key personnel could negatively affect our business, as could our inability to attract and retain qualified management, sales and technical personnel as and when needed.\nThe execution of our business strategy depends largely on the continued efforts of our management, including Philip Thomas (co-founder of LIBB and our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer) and Peter Dydensborg (our Chief Operating Officer). As we have a limited operating history, we are highly dependent upon their knowledge, experience and reputation within the industry. Either or both of these individuals may in the future choose to discontinue their employment with us. If so, we may not be able to find adequate replacements for them. Without their experience, expertise and reputation, our development efforts and future prospects would be substantially impaired. We have employment agreements in place with these individuals that include non-competition provisions.\nWe may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations, and they could change.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S., and other countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling laws, such as California\u2019s \u201cProp 65,\u201d which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, could become applicable to our products. Some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted, or have proposed to enact, regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, or disrupt the production or distribution of our products, and negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.\nThe ability of our business to grow and compete depends on the availability of adequate capital. We currently have negative cash flows from operations due in part to substantial marketing and promotional related expenses as well as our payroll expense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all to implement our growth strategy. As a result, we cannot assure you that adequate capital will be available to finance our current growth plans, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.\nWe have a limited operating history.\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses. There is no guarantee that we will become a profitable business. Further, our future operating results depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to manage our growth, retain our customer base and to successfully identify and respond to emerging trends in our market areas.\nWhile we currently produce only non-alcoholic beverages, we are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. To the extent that we expand our operations into new sectors of the beverage industry, our business operations may suffer from a lack of experience, significant costs of entry and the competitive conditions in the market, among other factors, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. As we principally have been engaged in the production of NARTD teas, we have limited experience with developing, producing, marketing and distributing alcoholic beverages. Additionally, we will be exposed to significant operating costs associated with developing new products and entering a new sector of the beverage industry and will face new regulatory burdens, which could have an adverse impact on our business as well as place us at a disadvantage relative to more established alcoholic beverage market participants. Furthermore, the alcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive. We will compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. In addition:\n\u2022 We may not be able to adequately distinguish our alcohol products from our non-alcohol products. Our inability to create the proper differentiation could result in customer confusion and could have adverse regulatory consequences.\n\u2022 We may not be able establish the proper infrastructure to support the supply chain from the manufacturing of the product to the ultimate purchase by the end consumer.\n\u2022 Our current management team lacks significant experience in the alcoholic beverage industry. We may be unable to attract and retain the necessary talent at the executive officer and board levels to execute our strategies in the alcoholic beverage industry.\n\u2022 Our product designs and formulas are subject to federal and state regulations. As a result, we may incur substantial product development costs on products that are not approved for sale.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, we may be unsuccessful in expanding our business to include alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, attempting such an expansion will require a substantial investment of resources and management time, which could materially adversely affect our more established non-alcoholic beverage business as well. Accordingly, we can offer no assurance that if we expand our business beyond NARTD teas, we will be able to effectively develop, produce, market and distribute such beverages, and such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our board of directors. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future, but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business. Therefore, any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nA robust public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell our common stock or depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQB, which is an over-the-counter market. The over-the-counter markets are inter-dealer markets that may provide significantly less liquidity than national securities exchanges. As a result, an active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell, or depress the market price of, our common stock. We are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will develop or will be sustained.\nThe public price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022 general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the beverage industry and the financial markets generally;\n\u2022 the political, economic and social situation in the U.S.;\n\u2022 actual or expected variations in operating results;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other business developments;\n\u2022 adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u2022 litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 purchase or sales of blocks of our common stock; and\n\u2022 operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our common stock is low, as it historically has been.\nOur outstanding convertible debt, warrants and options may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe presently have outstanding (i) employee stock options to purchase 194,667 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.75 per share held by certain of our executive officers, (ii) warrants to purchase up to 345,725 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share that were issued in private placement offerings conducted by us, (iii) the Lender Warrant to purchase 1,111,111 shares of our common stock at $4.50 per share and (iv) the Lender Note which is convertible into shares of our common stock at $4.00 per share (272,893 shares based on the current outstanding amount of principal and interest of $1,091,571, which excludes the $500,000 of advances approved on March 17, 2016). In addition, warrants to purchase common stock totalling 34,573 will be issued to the placement agent at an exercise price of $4.50 per share. Furthermore, we may issue additional equity awards covering up to 466,667 shares of common stock under our 2015 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d). The sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the Warrants and options and the shares issuable under our incentive plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these Warrants and options are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of common stock and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of the common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue 35,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. The issuance of additional common stock may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, the terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nOur senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully manage a publicly traded company.\nNot all of our senior executive officers or directors have previously managed a publicly traded company, and they may not be successful in doing so. The demands of managing a publicly traded company, like ours, is much greater as compared to those of a private company, and some of our senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully meet those increased demands.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely, or may rely, on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, the price of our common stock may be reduced, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the last day of 2020, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. For as long as we take advantage of the reduced reporting obligations, the information that we provide stockholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.\nObligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention, and we will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nWe became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC, including Sarbanes-Oxley, upon consummation of the Business Combination with LIBB and Cullen as described in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K. These requirements and rules may place a strain on our systems and resources and those of our subsidiaries, including LIBB, which was not previously subject to such regulation. For example, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources, will make certain activities more time-consuming and will cause us to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we had not previously incurred. Furthermore, the expenses incurred by public companies, generally, for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing, which may further strain our resources. We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, expand or outsource our internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. In addition, our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements while focusing on executing our business strategy. Our incremental general and administrative expenses as a publicly traded corporation will include costs associated with reports to stockholders, tax returns, investor relations, registrar and transfer agent\u2019s fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation. During 2015, we estimate that we incurred approximately $283,000 in additional costs in connection with being a public company, excluding compensation to directors and additional employees and all stock-based compensation. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur in future years, the timing of any increases in such costs or the degree of impact that our management\u2019s attention to these matters will have on our business.\nWe will be required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley as early as December 31, 2016, although as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we will be exempt from certain of its requirements for so long as we remain as such. For example, Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we and our independent auditors report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; however, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we may take advantage of an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement. Once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, unless at such time we are a \u201cnon-accelerated filer.\u201d We currently qualify as a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d and will generally continue to qualify as such for each fiscal year thereafter where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year, except that, regardless of our public float, we will continue to be a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d until we have filed our first annual report on Form 10-K and have been subject to the reporting obligations under the Exchange Act for 12 months. Management, however, is not exempt from Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, and will be required to, among other things, maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we will need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow us to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to fines, sanctions and other regulatory action.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we also intend to continue to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are permitted to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements, some of which are the same as the exemptions available to an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In general, we will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for each fiscal year where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year. We intend to take advantage of these exemptions and reduced reporting requirements until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and/or a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d at which time, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these additional requirements, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley.\nWe may become subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of the common stock.\nThe common stock may become subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cpenny stock rule.\u201d Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stock, and Rule 15g-9(d) incorporates the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. We may become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules if the market price of our common stock declines.\nSince our common stock may in the future be deemed to be penny stock, trading in the shares of the common stock may become subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. An individual qualifies as an accredited investor if he or she, together with his or her spouse, has assets in excess of $1,000,000 (excluding the value of such person\u2019s primary residence) or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse. For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such security and must have the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in an account and information to the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealer to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of common stock.\nIf the market price of the common stock declines, there can be no assurance that our shares of common stock will qualify for an exemption from the penny stock rule. In any event, even if the common stock was exempt from the penny stock rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.", "PERMNO": 16175, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "LBCC"}
