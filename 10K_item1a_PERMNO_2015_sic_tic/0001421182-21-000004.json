{"cik": "1421182", "company": "Verso Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks. Set forth below are certain of the more material risks that we face and that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results and negatively impact our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operation. Our business could also be affected by other risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nWe could be required to idle production, shut down machines or facilities, restructure operations, or sell non-core assets, which could result in recording significant closure costs and long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges.\nWe have responded to changing market dynamics by optimizing assets and streamlining our production, including idling or shutting down certain paper machines and facilities. For example, in June 2020, we idled production at our mills in Duluth, Minnesota and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin and in April 2019, we announced the permanent shutdown of our mill in Luke, Maryland. If demand for our products continues to decline, or if the pace of decline accelerates, it may be necessary to curtail production even further or permanently shut down certain machines and facilities. In addition to the potential loss of production, curtailments and shutdowns could result in asset impairments or accelerated depreciation and cash closure costs for the affected facilities, including restructuring charges and exit or disposal costs.\nLosses related to the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used are recognized when circumstances, such as continuing losses or demand declines in certain businesses, indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. When indicators that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset group in relation to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of an asset group is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group, an impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of the asset group\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. If it is determined that the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, we review and adjust, as necessary, the estimated useful lives of the assets in the group. If there were to be a triggering event, it is possible that we could record non-cash long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges in future periods.\nWe may be unable to obtain energy or raw materials, including petroleum-based chemicals, at favorable prices or at all.\nWe purchase substantial amounts of energy, wood fiber, market pulp, chemicals and other raw materials from third parties. We may experience shortages of energy supplies or raw materials or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If we are forced to seek alternative sources of supply, we may not be able to do so on terms as favorable as our current terms or at all. The prices for energy and many of our raw materials, especially petroleum-based chemicals, have been volatile and may be volatile in the future. Chemical suppliers that use petroleum-based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may, due to a supply shortage and cost increase, ration the amount of chemicals available to us and/or we may not be able to obtain the chemicals we need to operate our business at favorable prices, if at all. In addition, certain specialty chemicals that we currently purchase are available only from a small number of suppliers. If any of these suppliers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us in the future, we may be unable to obtain such chemicals at favorable prices, if at all.\nThe supply of energy or raw materials may be adversely affected by, among other things, natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power, and, in particular, events in the Middle East or weather events such as hurricanes could result in a real or perceived shortage of oil or natural gas, which could result in an increase in energy or chemical prices. In addition, wood fiber is a commodity and prices historically have been cyclical. The primary source for wood fiber is timber. Environmental litigation and regulatory developments have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in Canada and the United States. In addition, future domestic or foreign legislation, litigation advanced by aboriginal groups, litigation concerning the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity and the response to and prevention of wildfires and campaigns or other measures by environmental activists also could affect timber supplies.\nAny disruption in the supply of energy or raw materials also could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation. We have limited ability to pass through increases in our costs to our customers absent increases in market prices for our products. Furthermore, we may be required to post letters of credit or other financial assurance obligations with certain of our energy and other suppliers, which could limit our financial flexibility.\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with global, regional, and local weather conditions and climate change.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations which impact the productivity of forests, the frequency and severity of wildfires, the distribution and abundance of species, and other such events, which in turn may adversely or positively affect timber production and availability. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability of natural disasters. These natural disasters could affect our woodlands or cause variations in the cost of raw materials, such as virgin fiber, and adversely affect timber harvesting.\nWe are involved in continuous manufacturing processes with a high degree of fixed costs. Any interruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities may affect our operating performance.\nWe run our paper machines on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency. Any downtime at any of our paper mills, including as a result of or in connection with planned maintenance and capital expenditure projects, results in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively affect our results of operations for the period in which we experience the downtime. Due to the extreme operating conditions inherent in some of our manufacturing processes, we may incur unplanned business interruptions from time to time due to, among other things, transportation interruptions and mechanical, power or structural failures at our facilities. As a result, we may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our operational needs. In addition, the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct our business may be affected by natural disasters, including snow storms, forest fires and flooding which could cause our mills to stop running. Furthermore, during periods of weak demand for paper products or periods of rising costs, we have experienced and may in the future experience market-related downtime.\nWork stoppages and slowdowns and legal action by our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,700 employees of which 52% are represented by 11 local branches of 6 different unions. On February 28, 2019, the United Steel Workers union, or \u201cUSW,\u201d who represented employees at four Verso sites, voted to ratify a new Master Labor Agreement covering five USW local branches, or approximately 80% of Verso\u2019s hourly represented workforce as of December 31, 2019. The Agreement, which was effective on March 1, 2019, will run for a period of three years with staggered expiration dates at each of the affected sites. In addition, two smaller local unions (the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters) at two of the mill locations also signed and are participating in the Agreement. The remaining trade unions at two of the mill sites ratified new agreements in the fourth quarter of 2019. We may become subject to material cost increases as a result of future actions taken by the labor unions. This could increase expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, although we believe we have a good relationship with our employees, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future. Any of these factors could lead to operational delays or increased costs.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure may interfere with our operations and could compromise our information and the information of our customers and suppliers, exposing us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from customers. We use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and disaster recovery plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to security breaches, including those caused by physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, attacks by hackers, employee error and disruptions caused from unauthorized access and tampering, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In addition, we believe cyberattack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only access and attack systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and damage our reputation.\nWe rely on third parties for certain transportation services.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for transportation of our products to our customers and transportation of our raw materials to us, in particular, by truck and train. The transportation industry is subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can affect the economics of those third-party transportation providers by requiring changes in their operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing transportation services. If any third-party transportation provider fails to deliver our\nproducts in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell them at full value. Similarly, if any transportation provider fails to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions, strikes or other events. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation and negatively impact our customer relationships. In addition, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis could be adversely affected by the lack of adequate availability of transportation services, especially rail capacity, whether because of work stoppages or otherwise. If any of these third-party transportation providers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, we may experience increases in the cost of our transportation services as a result of rising fuel costs and surcharges (primarily in diesel fuel), which we may not be able to pass through to our customers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related efforts to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic, is impacting worldwide economic activity. In an effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, government and health authorities around the world have taken extraordinary and wide-ranging actions, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential, quarantines and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. Although some of these governmental restrictions have since been lifted or scaled back, recent surges of COVID-19 and the discovery of new variants of the virus may lead to restrictions being implemented in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We serve as an essential manufacturing business and, as a result, we have continued to be operational during this time in order to meet the ongoing needs of our customers, including those in other essential business sectors, which provide food, medical and hygiene products needed in a global health crisis. The guidelines and orders enacted by federal, state and local governments have impacted demand from retailers, political campaigns, and sports and entertainment events, driving reduced purchases of printed materials and substantially impacting our graphic paper business.\nWhile we cannot predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business at this time, the pandemic and related efforts to mitigate the pandemic have impacted and could continue to impact our business in a number of ways, including but not limited to:\n\u2022a decline in economic conditions and consumer confidence that have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising, and political campaign spending, all of which have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact sales volume and demand for our products, particularly in our graphic paper business;\n\u2022an adverse impact on timing of payments by customers;\n\u2022disruption of our mill operations, including the possible need to implement increased downtime at one or more of our mills due to decreased demand, new governmental mandates or for voluntary reasons, which could result in unabsorbed fixed costs, the loss of production, asset impairments or accelerated depreciation and cash closure costs for the affected facilities, including restructuring charges and exit or disposal costs if it becomes necessary to permanently shut down certain machines or facilities;\n\u2022the financial deterioration of, or the disruption to, one or more of our suppliers of energy or raw materials or the third parties we rely on for transportation of our products to customers, which may result in the inability of our suppliers or service providers to meet our needs in a timely manner, cause delays in delivery to our customers, result in cancellation of customer orders or a reduction in purchase prices and, ultimately, termination of customer relationships;\n\u2022limitations on our access to capital and other sources of funding, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, refinancing activities or other forms of capital raising;\n\u2022increased difficulty in maintaining our workforce during this uncertain time;\n\u2022increased employee absenteeism due to fear of infection;\n\u2022lawsuits or regulatory actions due to any COVID-19 spread in the workplace; and\n\u2022productivity of management and our employees that are working remotely, including the ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls.\nThese risks could accelerate or intensify depending on the severity and length of the pandemic. If a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus occurs or if the vaccines introduced to combat the virus are not effective, these factors will be exacerbated.\nOur liquidity during the pandemic and the recovery period after we emerge from the pandemic will depend on multiple factors, including the impact on demand for our products, our ability to continue operations at our mills, the impact of the pandemic on our suppliers and third party service providers, and our operating performance.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we continually evaluate the impact on our long-lived assets, including the potential for impairment charges. For example, in June 2020, we announced plans to indefinitely idle our mills in Duluth, Minnesota and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin and in January and February 2021, we reported our decision to permanently shut down our paper mill in Duluth, Minnesota and the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets at our Wisconsin Rapids Mill, respectively. Depending on future events, we may be required to record future impairment charges. In addition, depending on the ongoing impact of the pandemic, we may also be required to reserve for incremental credit losses. Any material increase in our allowances for credit losses would have a corresponding effect on our results of operations and related cash flows.\nWhile our mills have continued in operation as \u201cessential businesses\u201d during the COVID-19 outbreak, we have implemented strict health and sanitization protocols to keep our employees safe, including enhanced and more frequent cleaning of work areas, requiring social distancing while at our facilities, providing facemasks to employees, installing barriers in locations where employees work in closer proximity, and screening employees for potential symptoms. These additional safety precautions may also impact the productivity and profitability at our mills. Our corporate employees have been working remotely during this time and we suspended all non-essential travel for our employees and discouraged employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings.\nThe ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on our financial condition and results of operations, which could be material, will depend on all of the factors noted above, including other factors that we may not be able to forecast at this time.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs or other liabilities upon us.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions (including greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants), wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, site remediation and natural resources. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and permits issued thereunder, is a significant factor in our business and may be subject to the same or even increased scrutiny and enforcement actions by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and permits, which may impose increasingly more stringent standards over time as they are renewed or modified by the applicable governmental authorities. In addition, we handle and dispose of waste arising from our mill operations and operate a number of on-site landfills to handle that waste. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the projected cost of closure and post-closure care for certain landfill operations. We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, mill shutdowns or interruptions in operations for any failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. Moreover, under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the full cost to investigate or clean up such real property and for related damages to natural resources. We also may be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills, other properties or other locations where we have disposed of or arranged for the disposal of waste. For example, in November 2019, the state of West Virginia asserted in an administrative enforcement action that three above-ground storage tanks at our Luke Mill leaked and that we had failed to take certain actions to prevent and report the release of pollutants into the North Branch of the Potomac River. In March 2020, PRKN filed a federal lawsuit against us alleging the improper handling, storage, and disposal of wastes generated at our Luke Mill. In May 2020, Maryland joined the PRKN lawsuit and in July 2020, Maryland obtained dismissal of a lawsuit that it previously had filed with respect to the same facts. We are currently engaged in negotiations with each of these parties.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nThe printing and writing paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability may continue to be adversely impacted by such decline.\nThe coated paper industry faces a long-term, structural decline. From 2017 to 2020, demand for printing and writing paper in North America fell by roughly 33%. North America demand for coated freesheet has declined 38% from 2017 to 2020. Similarly, North America demand for coated groundwood has declined 49% from 2017 to 2020. However, the demand for coated paper is expected to increase in the future, with market volumes in 2021 projected to be 5% above 2020 levels.\nAdverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. During an economic downturn, end-users may reduce magazine subscriptions, contributing to lower demand for our products and advertising in printed magazines and catalogs may also decline. In addition, we could experience volatility in the capital and credit markets, which would impact interest and the availability of credit.\nFurthermore, significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulations and monetary, tax and trade policy, among other things could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could significantly impact our business and the industry in which we compete.\nForeign overcapacity could also result in an increase in the supply of paper products available in the North American market. An increased supply of paper available in North America could put downward pressure on prices and/or cause us to lose sales to competitors.\nDevelopments in alternative media could adversely affect the demand for our products.\nTrends in advertising, electronic data transmission and storage and the internet have had and likely will continue to have adverse effects on traditional print media, including the use of and demand for our products and those of our customers. Our magazine and catalog publishing customers may increasingly use (both for content and advertising), and compete with businesses that use, other forms of media and advertising and electronic data transmission and storage, particularly the internet, instead of paper made by us. As the use of these alternative media continues to grow, the demand for our paper products will likely continue to decline.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nCompetition in our industry is based largely on price. We compete with foreign producers, some of which are lower-cost producers than we are or are subsidized by certain foreign governments. We also face competition from numerous North American coated paper manufacturers. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including lower raw material and labor costs and may be subject to fewer environmental and governmental regulations.\nFurthermore, due to the trend toward consolidation in our industry, some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do or may be better positioned than we are to compete for certain opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in the markets we serve.\nCompetition could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors. In addition, our ability to compete will be affected by product availability, the quality of our products, our breadth of product offerings, our ability to maintain mill efficiencies and to achieve high operating rates, manufacturing costs, our ability to distribute our products on time and availability and/or cost of wood fiber, market pulp, chemicals, energy, other raw materials and labor.\nWe have limited ability to control the pricing of our products or pass through increases in our costs to our customers.\nOur earnings are sensitive to price changes in coated paper. Fluctuations in paper prices (and coated paper prices in particular) historically have had a direct effect on our net income (loss) and EBITDA for several reasons:\n\u2022Market prices for paper products are a function of supply and demand, factors over which we have limited control. We therefore have limited ability to control the pricing of our products. Market prices of grade No. 3, 60 lb. basis weight paper, which is an industry benchmark for coated freesheet paper pricing, have fluctuated since 2000 from a high of $1,105 per ton to a low of $740 per ton. In addition, since 2000, market prices of grade No. 4, 50 lb. basis weight paper, which is an industry benchmark for coated groundwood paper pricing, have fluctuated between a high of $1,075 per ton to a low of $710 per ton over the same period. As market conditions determine the price for our paper products, the price for our products could fall below our cash production costs.\n\u2022Market prices for paper products typically are not directly affected by raw material costs or other costs of sales, and consequently we have limited ability to pass through increases in these raw materials and/or other sales costs to our customers absent increases in the market price. Thus, even though our costs may increase, we may not have the ability to increase the prices for our products or the prices for our products may decline.\n\u2022The manufacturing of coated paper is highly capital-intensive and a large portion of our operating costs are fixed. Additionally, paper machines are large, complex machines that are more efficient when operated continuously. Consequently, both we and our competitors typically continue to run our machines whenever marginal sales exceed the marginal costs, adversely impacting prices at times of lower demand.\nTherefore, our ability to achieve acceptable margins is principally dependent on (a) our cost structure, (b) changes in the prices of raw materials, electricity, energy and fuel, which will represent a large component of our operating costs and will fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control and (c) general conditions in the paper market including the demand for paper products, the amount of foreign imports, the amount spent on advertising, the circulation of magazines and catalogs, the use of electronic readers and other devices and postal rates. Any one or more of these economic conditions could affect our sales and operating costs.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY\nOur annual production capacity has been significantly reduced and our business has become less diversified because of the Pixelle Sale, closure of our Luke Mill, our Duluth Mill and the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets at our Wisconsin Rapids Mill.\nThe reduction in the scale and scope of our business as a result of the Pixelle Sale, closure of our Luke Mill, our Duluth Mill and the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets at our Wisconsin Rapids Mill has significantly reduced our annual production capacity and exposed a larger portion of our business to the risks associated with the market for graphic paper. Our total annual production capacity is now 1.4 million tons. Our total company sales volume was down from 2,647 thousand tons during the year ended December 31, 2019, to 1,674 thousand tons during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, a greater portion of our product line will now be exposed to greater secular and cyclical risks associated with our business. If these difficulties or challenges cannot be overcome, our business may not be successful.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our business. Furthermore, we may have credit exposure to these customers through extension of trade credits.\nOur two largest customers, Central National-Gottesman and Veritiv Corporation, together accounted for 33% of our net sales in 2020. In 2020, our ten largest customers (including Central National-Gottesman and Veritiv Corporation) together accounted for 64% of our net sales. The loss of, or reduction in orders from, any of these customers or significant customer disputes regarding shipments, price, quality, or other matters could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them. Our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments. Our relationship with our customers is dependent on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products and services at competitive prices. If we lose customers or if we experience a significant decline in sales volume, we may not be able to quickly replace the lost revenue.\nFurthermore, we extend trade credit to certain of these customers to facilitate the purchase of our products, and we rely on these customers\u2019 creditworthiness and ability to obtain credit from lenders. Accordingly, a bankruptcy or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any of these significant customers could result in a reduction in sales, a longer collection cycle or an inability to collect accounts receivable.\nWe will be unable to compete with respect to certain specialty paper products for a period of two years after the closing of the Pixelle Sale, which occurred on February 10, 2020.\nThe Purchase Agreement entered into in connection with the Pixelle Sale provides that for a period of two years beginning on the closing date of February 10, 2020, Verso and its affiliates (excluding stockholders of Verso) have agreed not to engage in, own, operate or assist any other business or person in engaging in the business of designing, manufacturing, and selling any specialty paper products related to: (i) coated thermal transfer paper manufactured and sold at the Stevens Point Mill, (ii) coated direct thermal base paper manufactured and sold at the Stevens Point Mill or (iii) uncoated flexible packaging manufactured and sold at the Androscoggin Mill, subject to customary exceptions as outlined in the Purchase Agreement. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities.\nWe may not realize certain projected cost savings or productivity improvements, which could result in lower profitability for our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we identify opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. For example, through our continuous process improvement program, we have implemented focused programs to optimize material and energy sourcing and usage, reduce repair costs and control overhead. We will continue to utilize the process improvement program to drive cost reductions and operating improvements in our mill system and have targeted additional profitability enhancements in the next twelve months. Our strategy assumes that increases in productivity through our continuous process improvement program, including through a more efficient manufacturing process or engineering design enhancements, will result in economies of scale, and global competitive sourcing of our materials will reduce our raw material and other costs. Any cost savings or productivity enhancements that we expect to realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. Cost savings or productivity enhancements that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in pricing or volume, or through increases in other expenses, including wood, chemicals and energy. We cannot assure you that these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could adversely impact our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. On January 27, 2021, our Board of Directors appointed Randy J. Nebel as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Nebel had been serving as our interim President and Chief Executive Officer since Adam St. John\u2019s resignation on September 30, 2020 and has been a member of our Board of Directors since November 14, 2019. The transition to Mr. Nebel as our President and Chief Executive Officer is critical to our success. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ qualified personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, our future success requires us to continue to attract and retain competent personnel. Any failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and may require substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nWe may from time to time pursue opportunistic acquisitions, the success of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we identify an acquisition candidate to complement or expand our business, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and goodwill. The negotiation of any transaction, its completion and subsequent integration of any business acquired may be complex and time consuming, involve significant costs and may result in a distraction of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations. We may be affected materially and adversely if we are unable to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire. Similarly, we may divest portions of our business, which may also have material and adverse effects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect our competitive position and selling prices.\nWe compete with producers from around the world, particularly in North America. In addition to the impact of product supply and demand, changes in the relative strength or weakness of international currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, can also affect international trade flows in certain products. A stronger U.S. dollar may attract imports, thereby increasing product supply and possibly creating downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a weaker U.S. dollar might encourage U.S. exports, thereby decreasing product supply and possibly creating upward pressure on prices.\nWe may incur debt from time to time under our ABL Facility or through other means.\nWe had $176 million of borrowing availability under our ABL Facility (as defined below) as of December 31, 2020, and no amount outstanding. We also may incur additional debt in the future through other means. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our current or future debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or dilutive.\nFinancial covenants and restrictions under our ABL Facility could result in an event of default or limit our ability to pursue business strategies and changes relating to LIBOR could impact borrowing cost under our ABL Facility.\nUnder our ABL Facility, we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio when the excess availability under such facility is less than the greater of (a) 10% of the lesser of (i) the borrowing base at such time and (ii) the aggregate amount of revolving facility commitments at such time or (b) $27.5 million.\nOur ABL Facility also contains certain covenants which, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict Verso Paper and certain of its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, prepay other indebtedness, sell, transfer, lease or dispose of assets and make investments in or merge with another company, make capital expenditures, enter into sale and leaseback provisions, engage or enter into any new line of business, enter into transactions with our affiliates or amend or modify certain provisions of our, and our subsidiaries\u2019, organizational documents.\nIf we were to violate any of the covenants under our ABL Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver, it would be considered a default after the expiration of any applicable grace period and no additional borrowings would be available until the default was waived or cured. If we were in default under our ABL Facility, then the lenders thereunder may exercise remedies under such facility in accordance with the terms thereof, including declaring all outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable and the termination of any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.\nCertain covenants also apply to, and similarly restrict the operations of, Verso Holding. Any default under our ABL Facility could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nIn addition, borrowings under our ABL Facility bear interest at variable rates, primarily based on LIBOR as the reference rate. LIBOR is subject to national and international proposals for reform that may cause LIBOR to cease to exist after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. However, for U.S dollar LIBOR, it now appears that the relevant date may be deferred to June 30, 2023 for certain tenors (including overnight and one, three, six and 12 months), at which time the LIBOR administrator has indicated that it intends to cease publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be available, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of the development of alternative reference rates, and the transition to an alternative reference rate could result in an increase in our interest expense. We also have the ability to borrow under our ABL Facility based on the Federal Funds Rate as an alternative to the use of LIBOR.\nWe have certain material pension obligations. Future funding requirements related to these obligations could restrict cash available for our operations, capital expenditures or other requirements or require us to borrow additional funds.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have a defined benefit pension plan covering 57% of our employees. As of December 31, 2015, all of our defined benefit pension plans were frozen to new entrants. As of December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation for our pension plan was $1,527 million and the fair value of the pension plan assets was $1,177 million. The total underfunded status of the pension obligation calculated on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2020 was $350 million. In connection with the Pixelle Sale on February 10, 2020, Pixelle assumed $37 million of Verso\u2019s unfunded pension liabilities (see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2021, we expect to make cash contributions to the pension plan of $46 million (see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). A deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of the pension plan to increase, thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to the plan. In addition, we will require future operating cash flows to fund our pension obligations, which could restrict available cash for our operations, capital expenditures and other requirements. We also may not generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations, which could require us to seek funding from other sources, including through additional borrowings, which could materially increase our outstanding debt or debt service requirements.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFuture activist stockholder activities could adversely affect our business as (i) responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees and (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership could result in\nthe loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause the price of our common stock to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nOur stock price has been, and could continue to be volatile, and stockholders may be unable to sell shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nSince January 1, 2020 to the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K, our Class A common stock price ranged from $7.36 per share to $19.34 per share. The market price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent stockholders from being able to sell shares at or above the price at which they purchased them. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022conditions that impact demand for our paper products;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022market and industry perception of our success and competitive position within the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions or restructurings;\n\u2022changes in government regulations;\n\u2022arrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure;\n\u2022sales of common stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u2022changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding Plan Warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute the value of the shares of our common stock.\nAs of the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K, we have (i) outstanding warrants to purchase 2.3 million shares of our common stock, or the \u201cPlan Warrants,\u201d at an adjusted exercise price of $21.67 that expire on July 15, 2023, (ii) 0.9 million restricted stock units outstanding and (iii) 1.8 million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Verso Corporation Performance Incentive Plan. The exercise of equity awards, including any stock options that we may grant in the future, Plan Warrants, and the sale of shares of our common stock underlying any such options or the Plan Warrants, could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares. Investors may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of the Plan Warrants and any stock options that may be granted or issued pursuant to the Verso Corporation Performance Incentive Plan in the future.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation,\u201d which became effective on July 15, 2016, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders.\nTogether, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our Class A Common Stock. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to\npay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of the Company, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to alternative forums, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us by our directors, officers, or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law or to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We may consent in writing to alternative forums. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders are not deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis choice of forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us, which may discourage lawsuits against Verso and our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to Verso than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in Verso\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Verso might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nCorporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nPublic ESG and sustainability reporting is becoming more broadly expected by investors, stockholders and other third parties. Certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and stockholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon ESG or \u201csustainability\u201d metrics. These ratings may impact our investor base universe. Ongoing focus on corporate responsibility matters by investors and other parties may impose additional costs or expose us to new risks.", "PERMNO": 92670, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "VRS"}
